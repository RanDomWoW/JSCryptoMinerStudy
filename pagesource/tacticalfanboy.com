<p><strong>March 19, 2018 —</strong> In celebration of the upcoming World of Tanks 1.0 Update, Wargaming is releasing the World of Tanks AR Experience app worldwide on Android. The company worked closely with Google to develop an augmented reality experience built with ARCore, Google’s new AR platform for developers that has a scope of 100 million mobile devices, and is featured by Google as one of the launch titles for the ARCore platform.</p>
<p>The World of Tanks AR Experience allows users to see a tank battle raging around them, anywhere from gigantic life-size to tabletop scale. The AR vehicle also dismantles in mid-air to show off some of its core components, allowing users to learn more about these historical vehicles. The app features photo and video social sharing functions.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to collaborate with Google on delivering this unique AR experience to millions of users around the world,” said Matt Daly, Wargaming Special Projects, “With the recent release of World of Tanks 1.0, we’re taking tank combat up a gear, and the AR app will let our players extend their in-game experience to real life.”</p>
<p>World of Tanks AR Experience was developed with support from Gravity Jack, and will be shown at the Google booth at GDC this week. It is also available globally for free on the Google Play Store, with China arriving in April. The app is also available on the iOS App Store.</p>
<p>World of Tanks AR Experience is supported by Google Pixel devices, Samsung Galaxy Note8/S8+/S8/S7/S7 Edge, Asus Zenfone AR, LG V30/V30+ and OnePlus 5. It is also compatible with the following iOS devices: iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6x Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8plus, iPhone, iPad pro, and iPad 5.</p>

<p>Iron Harvest is a project currently up for funding on Kickstarter. Iron Harvest takes the art of Jakub Różalski and his &#8216;World of 1920+&#8217;, and adapts it to a Real Time Strategy video game. The World of 1920+ itself is an alternate history, which takes place in the early 20th century after a great war where powerful walking tanks and other heavy industrial-inspired weapons and technologies were used to great effect. </p>
<p>The campaign itself has reached its minimal funding goals, however it still has a way to go before its stretch goals are all reached, so if you&#8217;re interested give the campaign a look at the link below:</p>

<p><strong>Manassas, Virginia – March 15, 2018</strong> – Aimpoint, the originator and worldwide leader in reflex sighting technology, has announced the launch of a limited run of Micro T-2™ carbine ready sights in Flat Dark Earth (FDE) color. This is the first time the company has offered an FDE finished sight to the US market.</p>
<p>The sights are being finished with Cerakote® H-Series surface coating &#8211; an advanced thin-film ceramic coating that bonds completely with the aluminum alloy housing of the sight. Cerakote® finishes are known worldwide for their corrosion and chemical resistance, UV and thermal stability, and durability under extreme conditions.</p>
<p>“We needed to match our choice of color surface finish with the durability and performance of the Micro T-2 sight,” said Jonas Ardemalm, Director of Commercial Sales &amp; Marketing at Aimpoint AB. “Cerakote® offers an extremely durable coating that has been proven to perform under very demanding conditions, and it offers advantages beyond typical paint applications. We are very happy to offer this enhanced Micro T-2 to our customers in the USA.”</p>
<p>This initial run of FDE Micro T-2 sights is being offered on a test basis through a select group of authorized <strong><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001HPv29BrYAep64PrE2CulQTrU3LXmNLlOvC0po57OPJodOieAj8KJc7Xmbqgs0bVpymOjHxhfEcvFikl5vyhE8Qp8xY7WJ2DwLeBJfY_WcorD3I3GPl5WJuZZcl4rKzsSpPaPoWsDtrQ=&#038;c=tCWqLc0ucNF_e6JQWBzJdzOQlwaNrQ1T_oxW4F724YteqBCrFevQdw==&#038;ch=yy_h1eduzFOfyzN981tgW8KFCF_XaHXdcXIzM7L5za_SUXfV3UNDHw==">Aimpoint Dealers</a></strong> in the USA, and they are expected to sell out quickly.</p>

					<p><strong>Newington, N.H. (March 14, 2018) –</strong> SIG SAUER, Inc. expands its world-class Advanced Sport Pellet (ASP) line of airguns with the introduction of the new X-Five ASP CO2-powered pistol. Based on the popular X-Five Competition pistol, this semi-automatic .177 caliber air pistol has a single action only (SAO) trigger, ambidextrous safety and 20-round Rapid Pellet Magazine (RPM™). The X-Five also features a full-metal slide and frame with realistic blowback action and is virtually the same weight and feel as its centerfire counterpart.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tacticalfanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jpeg-1.jpg"><img src="http://www.tacticalfanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jpeg-1-440x310.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="310" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-19072" srcset="http://www.tacticalfanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jpeg-1-440x310.jpg 440w, http://www.tacticalfanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jpeg-1-300x211.jpg 300w, http://www.tacticalfanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jpeg-1.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></a></p>
<p>“The new SIG SAUER X-Five air pistol is an outstanding training tool as are all of our Advanced Sport Pellet airguns,” said Joseph Huston, Vice President and General Manager of the SIG SAUER Airgun Division. “Airguns allow for more flexibility as to where you can shoot, such as your back yard, and more and more professionals are buying airguns for this very reason. Airguns are also perfect for teaching beginners firearms safety and the fundamentals of shooting.”</p>
<p>The X-Five ASP air pistol has an adjustable rear sight and an accessory rail which allows easy mounting of a laser or tactical flashlight. There is also a cam lever CO2 loading port for quick loading of the 12-gram CO2 cartridges. The X-Five shoots up to 430 fps; however, velocity results may vary depending on temperature and altitude. Available in two colors: Silver/Black or solid Black.</p>
<p>MSRP: $139.99</p>

					<p><strong>OVERLAND PARK, Kansas &#8211; March 9, 2018 &#8211;</strong> Bushnell, an industry leader in high-performance sport optics, announces the release of a new Bushnell Ballistics App powered by the proven and powerful Applied Ballistics Ultralite Engine.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tacticalfanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/BushnellAppLGL.jpg"><img src="http://www.tacticalfanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/BushnellAppLGL.jpg" alt="" width="186" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19066" /></a></p>
<p>The new Bushnell Ballistics App is a companion app to use with Bushnell riflescopes to calculate firing solutions for ammunition and rifle combinations. The app allows users to use current atmospheric data and AB Laboratory bullet data to calculate the hold-overs needed to make precise shooting solutions.</p>
<p>“The new Bushnell Ballistics App is powered by the Applied Ballistics Ultralite engine, the most trusted ballistics data-cruncher in the industry,” said Bushnell Marketing Manager Matt Rice. “With a clean and user-friendly interface, this app allows users to easily build and modify gun profiles and build range cards to calculate firing solutions based on their specific scope and ammunition choices. All of our Bushnell scopes and reticles have been pre-loaded, giving users simple ballistic solutions anywhere they go.”</p>
<p>The free app works on both Android and iOS operating systems, and is available on Google Play and the App Store. It is optimized for Bushnell riflescopes and reticles, but is compatible with all optics. Once downloaded, the app functions off the grid, with no cell service required.</p>
<p>The app features AB Connect, which gives users a live library of G1/G7 data as well as the Applied Ballistics Bullet Library with more than 740 pre-loaded bullets. The Bushnell scope library features more than 150 scopes and 30 reticle options. Gun profile management provides up to five saved profiles with reticle-based firing solutions. Plus, multiple target engagement saves up to five targets. Atmospheric data can be updated manually or from the internet when connected. Angle range compensation is also calculated. Range cards can be shared or printed using the Email Range Card Function.</p>
<p>“The new Bushnell Ballistic App puts the power of long-range, first-shot accuracy into the hands of any shooter,” Rice said. “Like all of our products, it was designed to perform in any condition and to offer our consumers true value, with features that far exceed the price—which, in this case, is free!”</p>
<p>To download the app, simply go to Google Play or the App Store and search “Bushnell Ballistics” to get started.</p>
<p>Bushnell, a Vista Outdoor brand, is one of the most recognizable and trusted names in precision hunting, tactical and recreational optics and accessories. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.bushnell.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">www.bushnell.com</a>.</p>

<p>SOG&#8217;s Voodoo Hawk Mini is, as its name implies, a smaller version of the original Voodoo Hawk. How much smaller? Well, admittedly not majorly so:</p>
<p>Length: 12.5&#8243; (Mini) vs. 12.56&#8243; (Voodoo)</p>
<p>Blade: 2.75&#8243; (Mini) vs. 3.5&#8243; (Voodoo)</p>
<p>Weight: 23.10 oz. (Mini) vs. 28.50 oz. (Voodoo)</p>
<p>Still, it is measurably more compact, and with the same general design and material composition, just as functional and durable as the original. </p>
<p>Plus, the Voodoo Mini is about a sawbuck less expensive than the original Voodoo, and like its big brother comes with a nylon, snap closure sheath. </p>

<p>Solon, Ohio (March 8, 2018) &#8211; Air Venturi, the leading manufacturer and importer of airgun, airsoft, and ammunition brands, is introducing the Air Venturi Nomad, a 4500 PSI portable air compressor built for the airgunner on the move. Now available at AirVenturi.com, the release offers a portable, affordable filling option for PCP shooters.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the release of the Air Venturi 4500 PSI Compressor last year, we gave airgunners one of the first affordable PCP fill stations, a workhorse that could fill tanks and PCP guns alike at a much faster rate.&#8221; Says Kristen Coss, Marketing Manager at Air Venturi, &#8220;The Nomad is positioned as a portable fill station you can take with you, and is designed for filling PCP guns directly. It won&#8217;t fill as fast as the original AV compressor, but can easily pressurize a 250cc cylinder from empty to filled in just 9 minutes. If you have access to a car battery, you can fill your gun in as little as 3 minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Paul Milkovich, Air Venturi&#8217;s Director of Business Development, the Air Venturi Nomad Compressor marks a turning point in PCP airgunning and may attract more users to PCP airguns. &#8220;Typically compressors can be heavy, large, and have to stay cooped up in the garage. With an MSRP of $549.99, our compressor puts fast, portable refills within reach, at an attractive price.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Nomad plugs into a standard 110V outlet or attaches to a standard car battery. Once connected, it can fill PCP guns directly up to to 4500 psi with an adjustable cut-off switch. Each compressor includes a hose with female quick disconnect fitting, integrated moisture catch, and a bleed valve.</p>
<p>Approximate fill times:</p>
<p>Benjamin Marauder Pistol (65cc): 0-3000 psi in approx. 3 min<br />
Diana Stormrider (100cc): 0-3000 psi in approx. 3:45 min<br />
Air Arms S510 Xtra FAC (231cc): 1450-2900 psi in approx. 5:30 min<br />
Ataman M2R Carbine Ultra Compact (130cc): 0-4350 psi in approx. 8 min<br />
Evanix Rainstorm (250cc): 0 &#8211; 3000 psi in approx. 9 minutes<br />
Airforce Texan (490cc): 0-3000 psi in approx. 17 min</p>

<p>Winchester, Ky. (March 2018) &#8211; DoubleStar Corp, manufacturers of high-quality, US-made AR components, rifles and pistols, is proud to offer an alternative to cheap pistol stabilizers with the new DoubleStar Strongarm Pistol Brace. What sets the Strongarm apart from the competition is that it is made from rugged 6061 billet aluminum, unlike many of the plastic or soft foam products currently on the market.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tacticalfanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2.jpg"><img src="http://www.tacticalfanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2-440x329.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="329" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-19046" srcset="http://www.tacticalfanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2-440x329.jpg 440w, http://www.tacticalfanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2-300x224.jpg 300w, http://www.tacticalfanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2-768x574.jpg 768w, http://www.tacticalfanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></a></p>
<p>Made in America, the Strongarm is built to last, just like the rest of the DoubleStar and Ace product lines. The Strongarm features three QD swivel mounting points with swivel included and fits pistol buffer tubes with a 1.11 to 1.2 inch diameter.

<p>&#8220;With the popularity of pistol stabilizing braces on the rise, there are many that make the shooting experience less desirable because of poor materials or faulty production,&#8221; Nick Collier, director of special operations for DoubleStar, said. &#8220;We at DoubleStar know that people rely on our products, whether it is because they are military, law enforcement or serious competitors; therefore, it is extremely important to us that every part is carefully designed and manufactured in our state-of-the-art facility using only the materials and technology that will ensure our DoubleStar and Ace products will perform to our stringent standards.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Newington, NH (March 5, 2018) –</strong> SIG SAUER, Inc. expands its world-class Advanced Sport Pellet (ASP) line of airguns with the introduction of the new X-Five ASP CO2-powered pistol.  Based on the popular X-Five Competition pistol, this semi-automatic .177 caliber air pistol has a single action only (SAO) trigger, ambidextrous safety and 20-round Rapid Pellet Magazine (RPM™). The X-Five also features a full-metal slide and frame with realistic blowback action and is virtually the same weight and feel as its centerfire counterpart.</p>
<p>“The new SIG SAUER X-Five air pistol is an outstanding training tool as are all of our Advanced Sport Pellet airguns,” said Joseph Huston, Vice President and General Manager of the SIG SAUER Airgun Division. “Airguns allow for more flexibility as to where you can shoot, such as your back yard, and more and more professionals are buying airguns for this very reason.  Airguns are also perfect for teaching beginners firearms safety and the fundamentals of shooting.”</p>
<p>The X-Five ASP air pistol has an adjustable rear sight and an accessory rail which allows easy mounting of a laser or tactical flashlight.  There is also a cam lever CO2 loading port for quick loading of the 12-gram CO2 cartridges.  The X-Five shoots up to 430 fps; however, velocity results may vary depending on temperature and altitude.  Available in two colors: Silver/Black or solid Black.</p>
<p>MSRP:   $139.99</p>

<p><strong>Newington, N.H. (February 28, 2018) –</strong> SIG SAUER, Inc. congratulates Team SIG Members Max Michel and Lena Miculek on their outstanding placings at the USPSA Florida Open. Team Captain Max Michel won first place shooting his P320 RX and P320 X5 in the Carry Optics Division, while Pro Shooter Lena Miculek took the title of High Lady with a 5th place overall finish in the Pistol Caliber Carbine (PCC) Division shooting her SIG MPX Rifle.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tacticalfanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jpeg.jpg"><img src="http://www.tacticalfanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jpeg-440x315.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="315" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-19037" srcset="http://www.tacticalfanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jpeg-440x315.jpg 440w, http://www.tacticalfanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jpeg-300x215.jpg 300w, http://www.tacticalfanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jpeg.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></a></p>
<p>Drawing in almost 450 shooters from across the United States, Canada, Europe and South America the USPSA Florida Open Pistol Shooting Tournament was held at the Universal Shooting Academy in Frostproof, FL on February 15-18th. Competitors clashed in 11 challenging and unique stages, forcing shooters to keep up the pace and make complex decisions on the fly.</p>
<p>“There is a balance of speed and accuracy that must be met,” Michel said. “I feel I am able to do this best in the Carry Optics division.” Michel won 10 out of the 11 stages which clinched his first place victory. “I also believe the SIG P320 RX and P320 X5 I compete with give me the best chance to win.”</p>
<p>Earning the title of High Lady, Miculek kicked off her season by dominating the competition in what she believes may be one of the most creative and challenging matches of the year. “I would definitely say this wasn’t a warm up match,” Miculek said of the Florida Open. “Hard cover, half targets and long shots everywhere you look.”</p>
<p>“We are excited to have Team SIG out there representing SIG SAUER, and we look forward to seeing Max and Lena continue to push our products,” exclaimed Tom Taylor, Chief Marketing Officer and Executive Vice President of Commercial Sales for SIG SAUER.</p>

<p><strong>Anniston, Ala. (February 2018) –</strong> Creedmoor® Sports, the leader in precision rifle equipment and gear, is looking to their customer base for the next great Creedmoor Sports product. Creedmoor products are designed and produced several ways; first, by evolving an older product to meet today’s shooters needs; second, as a company by and for shooters, many ideas are born internally; and third, many of Creedmoor’s greatest ideas come from shooters who are out using products every day and know how to make it better. Creedmoor Sports wants to hear from you.</p>
<p>“We love it when a customer calls or emails us with an idea. If the idea has merit we will immediately try to put it into play. If a soft-good we try to take it from idea to sample within a couple days. The idea is walked back to our designer, it’s cut and sewn on the spot in our Anniston, Alabama facility and we start testing. If a hard-good, we start designing the product on our mill and lathe and see what it would take to bring to market,” said Dennis DeMille, Vice President of Operations, Creedmoor Sports.</p>

<p>Customer inspired products have included the Scope Kennel, a seemingly “why didn’t I think of that” product. Made with a top strap for easy rifle carry, it serves to protect a rifle scope. The Quad Fold Shooting Mat, another made in Anniston, Alabama and customer suggested, is designed for high power, smallbore, air rifle and casual shooting. The Quad Mat provides an extra comfortable platform and stable base for elbows and knees and when folded, measures just 2.5” X 19” X 29.” The recently released Bench and Field Shooting Mat was another customer inspired product. Not just a ground or just a bench platform, it’s both! Easy to carry and set up and totally color customizable, including a variety of hunting camos and military camos.</p>

<p>With Disney having no plans to release the unaltered trilogy to the public market, we have to make due with fan efforts. Efforts such as this project from YouTube channel The ReDiscovered Future, which restores the original 1976 Star Wars trailer using cleaned footage and scenes from the Star Wars Despecialized Edition. </p>

<p>YouTube channel ZaziNombies&#8217; lastest creation is a massive 6500 piece build of a minigun from the game &#8216;Fortnite&#8217;. It comes in at 4&#8242; long and weights over 18 lbs. No word on the length of time it took to build this beast, but a conservative estimate of its cost, based on LEGO&#8217;s current pricing on various bricks, puts this build at ~$800-1000, if the pieces were bought individually.<br />
