                <p align="justify">remembered the last time I mentioned the  word 'grant' in front of a Nigerian scholar. The looks in his eyes was so  strange. He wanted to eat me alive. Just like any other Nigerian, he argued  blindly and yelled, “There’s none! No matter how clever the innovation is,  you’ll have to fund it yourself ”.</p>
                <p align="justify">And if you’re like this man, I’m here to  hit you with the truth. I mean, if getting grants for your research projects  funded in Nigeria seem mysterious to you, too, then, you are not alone.

Put more work to it by reading this article, apply it and pray your panel  members do not turn your project defence to project attack! Project defense has come to stay,  and the only way to graduate in Nigerian universities is to at least defend  what you have written (or copied and paste) in a convincing manner. Gone are  the days when you could just copy and paste an article from  the internet and dump for your school. Our Nigerian school system is changing  from dumping grounds to speech oriented institutions, which means that you must  be good at presentations in order to scale through. At times students confuse  themselves with content of their work. The truth is that it is better to be  more confident with a poor content, than to be un-able to defend an excellent  research work...<a href="blog/making-awesome-presentations.html" target="_blank">Read More</a> </p>

Take note of these  questions and suggested answers, do good by researching more and not limiting  yourself to just these questions.<br />

                </p>

                <p align="justify"><strong><u>Question 1: In few  sentences, can you tell us what your study is all about?</u></strong><br />

                  The  question is simple right? Many professors will tell you that most students get  choked on a question like this. Anyways the question is simple, but a bit  technical. To answer this question, you need to know every detail of your  research project from chapters one to the end. The question needs an answer in  form of a summary of the entire study, therefore, to ace this particular question  you need to know every detail in your abstract. If you wrote a good abstract,  this question will be a cross over for you. &gt;&gt;&gt;Read More <a href="https://nairaproject.com/blog/25-common-project-defense-questions.html" target="_blank">Click Here </a></p>

                <p align="justify" class="title">September 17, 2015 By Ugochi Juliet </p>

                <p align="justify"><img src="images/nuc-thesis-award.jpe" alt="nuc" width="120" height="110" align="left" />The enormous  achievements in development in most of the developed countries comes mainly  through research. This made former president Goodluck Jonathan to task the  nation universities in the art of research. Following this mandate by the  federal government, the regulatory body of all universities in the nation, the  Nigerian Universities Commission (NUC) has been introducing various commendable  schemes and awards to advance the standard of education in the country as well  promote research among university students. </p>

                <p align="justify">One of such  award scheme was the Nigerian Universities Doctoral Thesis Award Scheme  (NUDTAS) which evolved from the Nigerian Universities Postgraduate Thesis Award  Scheme (NUPTAS) also instituted by the NUC (Nigerian Universities Commission).  According to the NUC, the scheme was introduced to promote best practices among  universities, identifying and encouraging best PhD thesis, encourage academic  research among students and to boost postgraduate scholarship. This can be  achieved by the students and their schools investing their intellect and time  in research. This is important as research plays an important role in nation  building. <a href="https://nairaproject.com/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-nuc-thesis-award.html">Read More&gt;&gt;&gt; </a></p>

If media houses do not    caption a football match between Nigeria and Ghana as 'Nigeria and Ghana   goes  to War again' they may continue enjoying being broke. In essence,   your project  topic and the material you produce should be captivating.   It should have the  magical power to draw people’s interest, and   achieve good grades for you.  Your  ability to come up with an interesting and good research project topic is your  first step in building an 'A' in Research Methodology. Fantastic research  papers in Nigeria do not fall from heaven. They come about as a result of  serious brainstorming mixed with great fun. Anyways in my little experience as  an independent researcher, I do not entirely agree that developing a project  topic should be too tasking. I rather see it as fun...<a href="blog/developing-outstanding-research-topics.html">Read More</a> </p>

                <p align="justify"><img src="images/phd-research.png" alt="phd" width="120" height="110" align="left" />The highest  level of education that exists is the PhD. While it can be frustrating and  tiring, your dissertation, which is your final result is a very rewarding thing  for you and a major achievement in your life. With a zeal to help PhD students  with their thesis, the duo of Dr. Gordon Rugg and Dr. Marian Petre wrote the  book - The Unwritten Rules of PhD Research. This is a no-holds-barred look  about what you as an individual needs to know when it comes to PhD research.  The tone of the book is witty from the start so that you will smile as you  learn the important messages it passes across. In the book, doctoral thesis is  seen as a respected work of art, one that you learned from your master as an  apprentice. This means that when you present your thesis research, you should  present it as someone who has thoroughly learned all about your subject and  done all the necessary research on it. <a href="https://nairaproject.com/blog/unwritten-rules-of-phd-research.html">Read More&gt;&gt;&gt;</a> </p>

                <p align="justify"><img src="images/group-research.jpg" alt="group research" width="120" height="110" align="left" />We  were assembled. We argued. We were at each other's throats. Then we settled. We  laughed hard. We played, prayed and hoped. Together. We presented. We failed. We  were blamed altogether. Then we pointed accusing fingers at each other. Finally,  we accepted our fate and moved on.<br />

                This  is a condensed depiction of what happened in a group research project I was  recently involved in. You see in life, at some point we would all have to be  engaged in group work of some sort. &gt;&gt;&gt;<a href="blog/how-to-handle-group-research.html">Read More Here </a></p>

                <p align="justify" class="title">Dec 8, 2014 By Samuel Ekpo </p>

                <p align="justify"><img src="images/student-supervisor-relationship.jpg" alt="healthy-study-relationship" width="120" height="110" align="left" />This is a common issue in the course of researching in an academic  situation. The ideologies of the supervisor and the students might not always  be similar. <br />

                This should however be handled with caution as a strained  relationship would affect the tone of the research work, the drive of both  parties, the final grade assigned to the student and the psyche of the student  even. The conflict here is assumed nothing physical but any that might hinder  or slow down the pace of work between both parties. &gt;&gt;&gt;<a href="blog/maintening-healthy-student-supervisor-relationship.html">Read More Here </a></p>

                <p align="justify" class="title"><strong><span class="style10">July 8, 2013 By <a href="http://facebook.com/rafael.chidi" target="_blank">Chidi Rafael</a></span></strong></p>

Some students  can meet their project supervisors up to 15 times before they scale through  chapter one. If you are having headache convincing your supervisor to approve  your chapter one or proposal, then this article is for you. 

                  You are welcome to my first part  of ‘Discover what your supervisor is looking for in your project work’. This  first series will cover the proposal/introductory sections of your research  work.  As we all know, good grades do not  just fall from heaven-it takes hard work and favor from God. Before you submit  that seminar paper or research paper with the caption ‘submitted in partial  fulfillment for the award of a degree’…. Your work must be good enough.<br />

                The first thing most supervisors’  need from every student is their project proposal or a chapter one. This phase  of a research work is the most important if you ask me. Why? Because this is  the foundation in which all research designs, findings, measurement instruments  will depend on. For instance your ability to link the background of the study with  your problem statement will go a long way in helping you to develop good  objectives and research questions to guide the entire study. So you now see why  this research phase is so important? <a href="https://nairaproject.com/blog/how-to-write-a-project-part1.html">Read More</a> </p>

Writing an abstract in an important phase in the research process;  hence in-order to make good grades with your research project and impress your  readers, one must be familiar with the techniques of writing a good, concise  and standard abstract. 

Before I discourse on how to write a good abstract, let’s talk a bit  about an abstract. Is it a bird or an insect? Absolutely not a bird or an  insect, an abstract in simple terms is a summary of a research project, thesis.  Dissertation, research journal etc. abstracts are usually seen at the beginning  of research paper...<a href="blog/how-to-write-a-good-and-standard-abstract.html">Read More</a></p>

There  are numerous packages or softwares that could be used to achieve this.<br />

The  choice of the method to use in the analysis depends on the function to be  achieved. However, even for the same function, there are multiple means of analysing  data, hence, certain things should be noted.<br />

The  method might be based on the popularity of the option in your environ. It might  be based also on what you were taught with in school. It might be specially  required for the kind of work you are doing. Possible options are discussed  below. All options have their pros and cons.&gt;&gt;&gt;<a href="https://nairaproject.com/blog/review-on-data-analysis-softwares-available-research-projects.html">Read More Here </a></p>

                    <p align="justify" class="title"> I once stumbled upon a sentence that greatly inspired me. The saying goes thus:  Every writer is a thief! Certainly you'd be quick to dispute that. The thing is,  we were born without the knowledge we have now garnered overtime, it is the  work of others that we have digested to become this informed.<br />

                      In  research, it is usual that there would   be an in-depth digging of past and similar work. It is required that due  credit is given to the author of what-so-ever sentence, experimental work, or  excerpt adapted into your work. This is to acknowledge their efforts, sponsor  hard-work and discourage theft of any form. This also helps the  readers/reviewers of your work  locate  the past work and go over.<br />

                    Plagiarism  - claiming someone else's work as yours is a terrible offence and a laugh-off  of creativity. This is strongly discouraged in all climes. Hence, the need for  this guide. &gt;&gt;&gt;<a href="https://nairaproject.com/blog/complete-guide-on-how-to-reference-in-research.html">Read More Here </a></p>

                    <p>Hypothesis  is a testable prediction, a statement of specific results or a suggested answer  to a research  problem or a conjectural  statement of the relationship between two or more variable being investigated  or a deduction from a postulate (Akinade&amp;Owolabi, 2009; Awoniyi,  Aderanti&amp;Tayo, 2011; Cherry, 2014).It can be regarded as the suggested  answer to a research objective and problem. It is an idea or guess regarding  how the researcher thinks the results of a study will look like. Simply put, it  is a tentative assumption, supposition, guess, inference, explanation or  prediction about some phenomenon that can be tested in a reasonable time frame.  It is always put in declarative statement to relate the research variables to  each other generally or specifically.While the  hypothesis predicts what the researchers expect to see, the goal of research is  to determine whether this guess is right or wrong (Cherry, 2014). <span class="title">&gt;&gt;&gt;<a href="https://nairaproject.com/blog/applying-hypothesis-in-research.html">Read More Here </a></span></p>

                    <p>Project writing and presentation is a prerequisite of getting  a degree by a student, either for graduate degree or postgraduate degree. You  need to read widely and extensively so you can have a lot of materials,  combined with what your lecturers thought you, to write a very good project.  After the write-up, comes the presentation. To make a good presentation of your  project, there are some rules you need to adhere to. There are some do’s and  don’ts you should stick to, to make sure that your project presentation goes  well. First let’s see the don’ts, the things you should not do. <a href="https://nairaproject.com/blog/dos-and-donts-of-project-writing.html">Read More&gt;&gt;&gt;</a> </p>

                    <p>Many Nigerian  students require some form of financial help to further their studies.  Sometimes they may need this money to travel abroad and complete their studies.  This can be obtained through scholarships and grants. There are many  scholarships and grants available to Nigerian students either to help them  complete their education here in the country or to travel abroad for their  schooling. These scholarships are provided by government, non-governmental  organisation, international agencies, individuals, educational institutions and  corporations. </p>

                  The grants and scholarships are meant to give  students financial relief from schooling and education affordable to the  winners. To be able to win these scholarships there are certain guidelines you  need to know, there are methods of applying for scholarship that will get you  accepted for the award. Here are some of the things you need to bear in mind  before you apply for a scholarship so as to increase your chance of being  selected. <a href="https://nairaproject.com/blog/how-to-apply-for-scholarship-in-nigeria-list-of-available-scholarship.html">Read More&gt;&gt;&gt;</a> </div>

                  <h2>CHOOSING THE RIGHT MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENT FOR RESEARCH PROJECTS  <em>by Japheth A. Yaya</em> </h2>

                </li>

			    <li class="title">
			      <p align="justify">Measurement  instrument refers to various methods through which a researcher obtains data  from respondents for his research work. The term data refers to all forms of  information that researchers obtain from the participant of the study. Adedokun  (2003:57) asserts that data refers “to any fact, observation or facts relating  to the subject of the study”. There are different types of measurement  instruments that can be used by researchers for their studies; it depends on  the nature of research that is to be carried out. In this write up, we shall  discuss various measurement instruments that can be used alongside with studies  that are suitable for them. <a href="https://nairaproject.com/blog/measurement-instrument.html" target="_blank">Read More&gt;&gt;&gt;</a> </p>

			      <div align="justify">The essence of  research is to find more knowledge and add to the   existing body of knowledge.  How has your study contributed to the Body   of Knowledge? This is one question  students especially at the Masters   or PhD level must answer one day. The body  of knowledge (BOK)   encompasses every field of study from medicine to soap  making and even   our regular sports. You may choose to look at it as a vast  library that   needs constant updates from brilliant and creative minds to solve    newer issues in the society. If you do not contribute, posterity may   suffer  because they cannot rely on old data and theories to survive and   keep up with  the pace at which the world is evolving today coupled   with rapid growth in  technology. Just imagine if we were to be using   research studies on Malaria  conducted in 1890 to cure Malaria   today...imagine how many people that will die  as a result of no current   work to show that nutrition has improved, life styles  have changed,   hygiene is getting better, mosquitoes are getting smarter, newer  herbs   and chemicals exist-now that is the essence of research! So do not feel    bad when asked if your work will or has added to existing knowledge. <a href="https://nairaproject.com/blog/ways-to-contribute-to-the-body-of-knowledge.html">Read More&gt;&gt;&gt;</a></div>

			    <li class="title style9"><strong>By Divine Nwachukwu</strong></li>

			    <li class="title style9">

			      <p align="justify">In statistics, determination of sample size to be used for  research has generated a lot of controversy. Sample size and power estimation  is an important concern for researchers undertaking research projects but most  often than not they have been misunderstood or ignored completely.<br />

                  <strong>What is sample size?</strong></p>

			    </li>

			    <li class="title style9">

			      <p align="justify">According  to inferential and descriptive statistics, sample size of any population is a  subset or a smaller unit of the main population on which a research is to be  carried out. For the outcome of any research about a population to be generalized,  the sample size has to be able to explain the characteristics of the main  population under study. <a href="https://nairaproject.com/blog/5-incredible-softwares-that will-determine-sample-size-for-research-projects.html">Read More</a>&gt;&gt;&gt; </p>
