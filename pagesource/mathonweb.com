    <h2>MathOnWeb.com</h2>
    
    <p>Welcome to MathOnWeb.com, home of the Algebra Coach and many other great programs.  
      Our goal is to create software and resources that makes it easier for students to 
      learn mathematics and for teachers to teach mathematics. 
    Our programs are designed to let you stay focused on the big picture while they take care of the details.</p>
    
    <p>Here is what we offer:</p>
    
    <p>The <strong><a href="alg_coach.htm">Algebra Coach.</a></strong>  
    This is a Windows program that shows you step-by-step how to solve your high school 
    and college-level algebra problems</a>.  You can download it and try it out free for three weeks. 
    If you like it then you can buy it for $24.95, about the same price as a basic calculator!</p>  
    
    <p>The <strong><a href="technology_suite.htm">Technology Suite.</a></strong>
      This is a set of ten Windows programs that show you how mathematics is applied to technologies such 
    as electrical, mechanical and structural engineering. The suite includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Six programs that deal with systems of equations and their applications.</li>
      <li>Three programs that deal with vectors and complex numbers.</li>
      <li>One program that helps you visualize differentiation and integration.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The <strong><a href="algebra_e-book.htm">Algebra <em>e</em>-book.</a></strong> 
    This is a hyperlinked electronic textbook on high school and college-level algebra.  
    The topics range from pre-algebra, through functions, logarithms, exponents, trigonometry, 
    equations, systems of equations, all the way to complex numbers. 
    It has a synchronized table of contents, index and full search capability. 
    It is included with the Algebra Coach program but     you can  download it separately. 
    There is also a version that you can view in your browser.    </p>
    
    <p>The <strong><a href="resources.htm">Resources.</a></strong>  These are Excel spreadsheets and Maple worksheets that supplement the four books <em>'Mathematics', 'Calculus', 'Differential Equations' and 'Multivariable Calculus for Electrical Technology'</em> written by Eric Hiob.</p>
    
    <p> The <strong><a href="entrtain/fun.htm">Math Fun</a></strong> pages show that mathematics is also  entertaining. Check them  out.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a href="faqs.htm">FAQs</a></strong> answer questions concerning downloading, installing and using the programs.</p>
