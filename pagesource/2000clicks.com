<p>Welcome to the McRae Family Website, which consists mostly of a number of 
literary, educational, and speculative projects by Graeme and his dad, Eion.&nbsp; 
These are:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	<a href="http://2000clicks.com/eionf/young_alexandra.htm">The Young 
	Alexandra</a> is the story of the youth of Alexandra Teploff née Meyendorff 
	(1907&ndash;2008), a figure well remembered in Tewksbury Township, New 
	Jersey, for her 
	decades of inspiring work in teaching and other services to the community. 
	The story begins with Alexandra's origins in the aristocracy of 
	pre-revolutionary Russia, and her birth and early childhood in the 
	privileged opulence of the Meyendorff household in St Petersburg. It 
	continues with her family's flight from the city to escape the mounting fury 
	of the Revolution, a flight that led to an extended anxious and gritty 
	sojourn in the Russian countryside and eventually a quick dash across the 
	border to the relative safety of Estonia. It concludes with Alexandra, by 
	this time a young woman, leaving Estonia to find an independent life in 
	America.</p>
	<p>
	<a href="http://2000clicks.com/EionF/Gourmets%20in%20Hyperspace/Contents.htm">A Gourmet in Hyperspace</a> is a novel set in the turbulent final years of 
	the Prohibition era, shortly before Prohibition was repealed on 30 December 
	1989... 1989?!&nbsp; Hello there, wasn't Prohibition repealed in 1932?&nbsp; 
	Yes, one of them was.&nbsp; But as related in <i>A Gourmet in Hyperspace,</i> 
	there were were actually two Prohibitions.&nbsp; This came about in a way 
	that did not make it into history books...&nbsp; (<a href="http://2000clicks.com/EionF/Gourmets%20in%20Hyperspace/blurb.htm">more</a>)</p>
	<p><a href="http://2000clicks.com/Graeme/">Graeme</a> - ideas, rants, 
	opinions, collections of links, and writings on various topics, loosely 
	organized in a hierarchical structure.</p>
	<p><a href="http://2000clicks.com/MathHelp/">Math Help</a> - Graeme's effort 
	to classify a variety mathematical topics to be educational and helpful to 
	students through high school and maybe the first year of college.&nbsp; My 
	aim is not to be comprehensive, but rather to be clear helpful in the areas 
	I address.</p>
	<p><a href="http://2000clicks.com/IanAndBlancheStory/">Ian and Blanche Story</a> 
	- The story of Eion's parents, which Eion researched quite a few years ago 
	on a visit to Australia.</p>
	<p>
	<a href="http://2000clicks.com/EionF/Francophile%20Gourmet/Gourmet%20Diaries/enjoying_france.htm">
	Enjoying Little Restaurants in France</a> - Eion and Jean's guidebook in 
	which they share their experiences and advice.</p>
	<p><a href="http://2000clicks.com/ClanHistory/">Clan Macrae History</a> in 
	Scotland from the 15th to 19th centuries, from the public domain Clan Book, 
	which Graeme &quot;webified&quot;.</p>
