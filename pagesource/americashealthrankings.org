To address this issue, we included coverage estimates for the 3 individual vaccines to highlight the differences in coverage by vaccine. In addition, this year data became available for male HPV immunization coverage in all states except Mississippi. We averaged the female and male z scores to create a composite HPV vaccine coverage score. The Immunization — Adolescents measure was calculated as the average of the z scores for Tdap, MCV4, and combined HPV (female and male).

The method of calculating health screenings was refined to better account for the slight difference in age recommendations between colorectal cancer screening and mammography screening. To allow for comparability, health screenings data for all prior editions were adjusted using the new method. Health screenings is a composite measure that captures the percentage of women who reported receiving a mammogram within the past two years (aged 65 to 74 years) and the recommended colorectal cancer screening within the recommended time frame (aged 65 to 75 years), and the percentage of men aged 65 to 75 years who reported receiving the recommended colorectal cancer screening within the recommended time frame.","type":"unordered-list-item","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[]},{"key":"17cl0","text":"2016 Senior Report\nThe following changes were made to the 2016 Edition:\n","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[{"offset":0,"length":18,"style":"BOLD"}],"entityRanges":[]},{"key":"61db9","text":"Replaced Chronic Drinking with Excessive Drinking—a combined chronic drinking and binge drinking measure.
