<p>With the advancement in the field of computer technology and especially in that of the area of internet and its sub divisions, more and more people have flocked to check out and ultimately become regular users of this facility. They become part of an ever-growing number of what we call the “internet audience” and according to the latest and most critically acclaimed statistics, the number of people who now have access and are using the internet as of 2015 are about 3.2 Billion! This is a huge number comparing with the fact that the total population of the world is no more than 7 Billion today.
<p>With this added traffic over the World Wide Web, anonymity and privacy has now become commodities of paramount importance. The term “Hacker” is not unbeknownst to anyone in this day and age. There are people and organizations out there whose sole purpose is to steal your identity over the internet for their own personal motives. This can lead from the mere prank to public humiliation whether it be sexual, monetarily or personally. Bearing this in mind there are hundreds of thousands of softwares and websites that claim to rid you of such nuisance. These are termed as proxy softwares or proxy websites and FreeProxyServer.co is also falls under this category.
<h2>Why Do People Need Free Proxy Server (or) Free Proxy Sites ?</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the primary service that proxy websites provide is privacy and anonymity to their users so they feel more secure and can surf and browse the internet more freely and casually. But some other purposes of being active users of proxies are listed below:
<p><strong>1. Unblock blocked Content:</strong>
<p>One of the primary motives behind the ever-growing use of proxy websites and proxy servers is to try and unlock the content of the internet which is blocked by the higher authorities of where you are hailing from! Governments and Telecommunication authorities can sometimes block certain type of content on the internet and hence the whole section of the world which falls under their control loses accessibility to those parts of the web. Proxy websites like the FreeProxyServer.co help to bypass these locks and unblock all content available on the internet right down to the last website. Certain websites that may not be in the country’s interest can be easily accessed which would have been otherwise blocked as well as websites containing pornographic content. Pornography and its related websites are banned in a number of countries of the world but with the help proxy websites, you can easily unblock all of these websites.
<p><strong>2. Anonymous Browsing:</strong>
<p>Another purpose of using proxy websites, as explained earlier is to protect ones identity on the internet and remain anonymous and private while surfing the World Wide Web. Websites like the FreeProxyServer.co hide your true identity under a mask formed by an identity provided to you by the website so you need not to worry about hackers or trackers that may want to destroy your image. 
<p>3. <strong>By Pass Firewalls:</strong>
<p>If you are a university or a college student then you must have come across this scenario more than once that your institute restricts online traffic to only a number of study related websites like “Wikipedia” and simple google research. These are called firewalls and they sort of work the same way like blocking content on a national level but these can also be easily by passed by the use of such proxies giving you unlimited internet connectivity anywhere, any place and anytime! 
<p><strong>4. Web Development:</strong>
<p>Proxies also serve as powerful tools when it comes to web developments and activities related to this field. If you are a web developer and have changed some things about your website but you cannot see the changes being reflected upon regular browsing then you can make use of FreeProxyServer.co to gain access to the modified version of your website very easily and freely.
<h2>Why Free Proxy Server .co? </h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, there are hundreds of thousands of such websites as well as software's that can be used to gain access to all the advantages that come with proxy surfing, but here just a few points that make FreeProxyServer.co stand out from the crowd as one of the best proxy websites out there on the internet:
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ads:</p></li></ul>
<p>Unlike other websites, we don’t fill our pages with ads that keep popping up onto the screen causing a hindrance for the user as well as a degree of difficulty. We also make use of ads but not in the way that other websites do! We don’t make them flash on your screen randomly just to annoy you!
<ul>
<li>
<p>Popups:</p></li></ul>
<p>As mentioned just now, our website is free of all sorts of popups which would make your user experience crappy and full of nuisance. We don’t show any pop ups on your screen so you can browse in peace.
<ul>
<li>
<p>URL bar:</p></li></ul>
<p>Some proxy websites on the internet just hide the URL bar when the used comes into contact with them for some reason. As we all know, the URL bar is one of the most important bars on any web page as it allows for easy surfing all over the web. FreeProxyServer.co does not do that and we display everything right in front of the user to make the experience all the more enjoyable for them.
<ul>
<li>
<p>Servers:</p></li></ul>
<p>Our proxy site is powered by high end servers at the back end of the transmission which ensures that you get a regular speed of surfing whatever be the time of the day that you are using our website. We ensure no lags, no buffering and no limitation of speed to any and all users who use our websites.
<ul>
<li>
<p>Installation:</p></li></ul>
<p>Another advantage that the FreeProxyServer.co has over regular proxy softwares is the fact that it requires no installation and hence need not to be wasted any time upon. Just go the URL: <a href="https://www.freeproxyserver.co/">FreeProxyServer.co</a> and type in the URL you want to use, click GO! And start surfing…
<p>After reading the above mentioned description, we hope you would choose FreeProxyServer.co for all your anonymous online browsing. </p>
