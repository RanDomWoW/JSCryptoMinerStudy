              <p>Decide community and friends,</p>
              <p>As you may have heard, Decide was acquired by eBay, the worldwide
              commerce leader.</p>
              <p>Since we started three years ago, weve been on a mission to bring you
              a more transparent shopping experience and help you feel more confident
              in your purchase decisions - in fact, we've been downright obsessed
              with it.</p>
              <p>Over the past year, we began experimenting with eBay and discovered an
              exciting opportunity to apply our team's strength in data and predictive
              analytics to help over 25 million eBay sellers make smarter decisions and
              be more successful. </p>
              <p>We want to thank you - our loyal users, members, media partners
              and investors. You supported and trusted us and are the reason we have
              this incredible new opportunity ahead of us.</p>
              <p>We will continue to bring you the same innovative products and
              thinking as part of the eBay family. Thank you for being a part of our
              journey!</p>

              <strong>What happened to the old site?</strong>
              <p>
                Decide.com was shut down on September 30. We also removed our app
                from iTunes and will not continue supporting it.

              <strong>Will Decide be integrated into eBay or exist as a separate entity?</strong>
              <p>
                The entire Decide team will be a part of this exciting new chapter
                and has already made the move to eBay's new Seattle-area offices.
