For the most part, it was a positive experience. I did not know exactly what I wanted to study when I came to the university but I found my niche within the criminal justice department. Michigan State is such an enormous school that if you are unable to find a place to mesh, you may be lost in the numbers. My first couple semesters I felt like I was just my student ID number and I had no identity to any of the professors. Luckily, when I began taking classes within my major, I felt the unity I had been missing.&#8221; -Student at Michigan State University<br /> <img src="https://2cka5v3o6m3z1nd8vc3innc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/stars-3.png" alt="stars-3" title="stars-3" width="99" height="20" /></div><div class="quotestyle"><strong>Student Review:</strong> &#8220;When I started the criminology program I was excited to learn that the major was 5th best in the United States for graduate school. I knew from that the classes will be highly informative and professors will be well trained in what they teach. In the course catalog the program offers a wide variety of interesting classes that I wanted to take. Unfortunately, a lot of those classes that I wanted were not offered during the time I was there. I was hoping the program would offer more hand on experience classes, instead of just reading different theories in a book. Each class got highly repetitive which was good and bad. It was beneficial as I would not lose the information after the class was over, but bad because it became boring to sit through lectures. My experience was not all bad though. A lot of my professors were really entertaining and had a lot of knowledge in the field. Some professors had guest lecturers that had careers in law enforcement and they shared their insights into it. My dream job is to be a juvenile probation officer. I feel well prepared after graduating from UCI.&#8221; -Danielle A., student at University of California, Irvine<br /> <img src="https://2cka5v3o6m3z1nd8vc3innc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/stars-4.png" alt="stars-4" title="stars-4" width="99" height="20" /></div><div class="quotestyle"><strong>Student Review:</strong> &#8220;My experience at SUNY Albany was definitely a positive one. I transferred into UAlbany junior year from a very large public university in Florida and the staff helped me transfer in easily. The main uptown campus is beautiful in the spring and fall months. Winters in Albany can definitely be harsh at times but the tunnels in the podium help keep the students out of the weather. I studied Criminal Justice, which is one of the best programs in the country. My classes averaged at 30 students so it was easy to make friends and get personal time with the professor if needed. Many of my professors were very helpful and always available to meet if needed. Social life at UAlbany is definitely one of the highlights; there are so many different clubs and organizations to join. I pledged a sorority while I was there and it was one of the best decisions of my life. One major complaint I had was the food. The food in the cafeterias are not great at all and the hours do not accommodate students well.&#8221; -Gina P., student at SUNY-Albany<br /> <img src="https://2cka5v3o6m3z1nd8vc3innc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/stars-3.png" alt="stars-3" title="stars-3" width="99" height="20" /></div><div class="quotestyle"><strong>Student Review:</strong> &#8220;I am a criminal justice major and currently attend Rutgers through their communiversity program. This program has been very beneficial. The main perk is the class size is small, about 39 students per class as compared to big lecture halls. The communiversity program that I go to is located off the main campus at a building much smaller then a big campus. They have many night classes which is great for me because I work during the day. The main thing that I disliked is that there are not many online classes offered for criminal justice. I feel that every other major is online except criminal justice. Another thing I really like about my program is the consistency of professors. You see the same professors throughout your entire program while bigger campuses have many professors. I like to know what to expect from my professors and I find comfort in that consistency.&#8221; -Beth P., student at Rutgers University<br /> <img src="https://2cka5v3o6m3z1nd8vc3innc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/stars-5.png" alt="stars-5" title="stars-5" width="99" height="20" /></div><div class="quotestyle"><strong>Student Review:</strong> &#8220;John Jay College of Criminal Justice in NYC was almost everything I could hope for. I majored in Criminal Justice and minored in Law. I found that the teachers were great with many of them challenging me a great deal. However, along with those challenges came reward. I was able to learn many things. I was also able to view actual court cases in my studies and take part in many mock trials. The school&#8217;s online classes were a huge plus, especially for those who worked. Though my teachers went above the normal for a teacher there were definitely draw backs. The personnel at the school were rather disorganized.&#8221;-Student at John Jay College Criminal Justice<br /> <img src="https://2cka5v3o6m3z1nd8vc3innc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/stars-4.png" alt="stars-4" title="stars-4" width="99" height="20" /></div><div class="quotestyle"><strong>Student Review:</strong> &#8220;Western Carolina University was a great experience that is largely tailored to students working full time and seeking to further their education. While they also offer a traditional and residential setting, the online program is largely what sets them apart from other universities. Their Forensic Science course is cutting edge and also offer many options from a social perspective. Many students who graduated from the criminal justice program with me were already employed in law enforcement, but were seeking a career change in the same field and gained valuable experience and job related skills. Western Carolina also spares no expense in ensuring that they keep up with this constantly changing field as new technology comes available. The advisors are also rated very high and keep every student up to date with graduation requirements, which most people with any experience in college understand can be a hassle. I would not recommend the online program to anyone who has novice computer skills. Regular communication is required including: sending and receiving emails several times daily, replying to message boards, using several microsoft programs, blackboard, and occasional installation of codecs or java for viewing streaming seminars and classes.&#8221; &#8211; student at Western Carolina University<br /> <img src="https://2cka5v3o6m3z1nd8vc3innc1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/stars-5.png" alt="stars-5" title="stars-5" width="99" height="20" /></div><p><a name="outlook-by-state"></a></p><h2>Criminal Justice Employment Outlook By State</h2><p><em>The CJDS Employment Outlook by state index has been moved to the <a href="/criminal-justice-careers/">Criminal Justice Careers</a> page.</em></p><p><small>References:<br /> 1.
