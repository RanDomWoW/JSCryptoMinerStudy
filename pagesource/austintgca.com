  <p align="left" style="font-size: large; color: #000000; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: large; color: #000000;"><span style="text-align: left">TGCA and K-MAC Sports announced this past July 18 they  were teaming up to bring additional spotlight coverage to each of the girls&rsquo;  University Interscholastic League (UIL) state championships in Volleyball,  Basketball, and Softball for the upcoming 2017-18 school year.<br />
        <br />
&ldquo;The Texas Girls Coaches Association is very  excited to partner with K-MAC Sports for the advancement of girls&rsquo; volleyball,  softball and basketball from the additional exposure to the UIL state  championships by using media to promote the games to teams, players, coaches  and fans of these sports.&nbsp; We feel this will be an added advantage for  state champions of volleyball, basketball and softball,&rdquo; said TGCA Executive  Director Sam Tipton.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;We'll broadcast a  State Preview Show on K-MAC  Sports online (<a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kmacsports.com&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cchucklicata%40hotmail.com%7C990d9be4010747d3151a08d526df0c0a%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C636457661774339499&amp;sdata=aRTEuHUPFIzps7Ji%2BjhbpsRRjj9ETfj37Couv%2Fm1M4E%3D&amp;reserved=0">www.kmacsports.com</a>).,&rdquo;  Licata stated. &ldquo;We hope to get a State Tournament coach or two on the air as well (wink).  Our goal is to bring much-deserved  publicity to the hard-working student-athletes and coaches who worked their way  to the State Tournament. It's a celebration of those teams attaining their  season-long goal of participating  at state.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
The announcement of the TGCA/K-MAC Sports venture this  summer came off the success of the broadcasts of this summer's TGCA All-Star  games, which garnered over 13,000 combined viewers. K-MAC Sports will bring  additional coverage to the three UIL state championships with written stories,  live interviews, and more via the most prevalent web-sites and social media.  K-MAC Sports will not be broadcasting any of the state tournament games  themselves. </span></span></p>

  <p align="center"><strong style="color: #0000FF;">NOMINATION GUIDELINES REVISIONS</strong></p>
  <p align="left">The Board of Directors voted to pass the following amendments to the nomination guidelines by EC proposal on June 4, 2017:
  </p>
  <p align="left"> Executive Committee Proposals to the Texas Girls Coaches Association                                                                               June 4, 2017</p>
  <p align="left"> EC 1:  A proposal to allow All-Stars in Cross Country, Volleyball, Basketball, Softball, Track and Field, and Cheerleading to be nominated for the honor by any member coach in good standing of the Texas Girls Coaches Association.  For an individual to be selected to an All-Star team, the head coach must be a member in good standing.  The current head coach must be contacted for approval of the player being selected as an All-Star.
  </p>
  <p align="left">Rationale:  This will allow more individuals to be nominated to be considered for the All-Star teams.  This will put more responsibility on the Committee members to make sure the best in their Region are considered for All-Star status.
  </p>
  <p align="left">EC 2:  The selected recipient of the outstanding individual (Athlete of the Year) in Cross Country, Volleyball, Team Tennis, Basketball, Soccer, Cheerleader, Tennis, Wrestling, Golf, Swimming & Diving, Softball, and Track & Field may be selected from any grade level from 9-12.
  </p>
  <p align="left">Rationale:  If it is our desire to pick the best, it is important to look at all grade levels to make the choice.    </p>
  <p align="left">Reminder: Cross Country All-Stars will have 24 selected in 1A-2A-3A-4A and 24 selected in 5A-6A and must be incoming seniors (juniors).    </p>
  <p align="left">Please be sure your membership is current before November 1st, so you will be allowed to nominate your athletes and receive honors without having to go through the appeals process or pay an additional $60.00 override fee.</p>
