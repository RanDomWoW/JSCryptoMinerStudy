He is amazingly accurate and fast. Everybody who participated in the class said it was the best they had ever been to. They all raved about it. I have trained our officers in Ben Cooley’s techniques and they have had a profound effect on performance and attitude. </div>

By the second day of training, my tactical team was inspired and transformed, and returned to the job more confident and aware. I’d highly recommend Ben Cooley’s course.</div>

<div class="testo_body">Watching your video’s at home at my own pace, in my spare time was just the answer I was looking for. I am a Correctional Officer, at maximum security prison in Southern California. There are nearly 1000 male inmates, most of them have life sentences and are never going home. They'd kill or hurt you if the chance was there. Working long hours in such an environment does not leave me much time to train self defense . Since my purchase I have run into a few serious incidents, where I put to use what Frank Cucci had taught me and walked away unharmed. Without the knowledge from your videos, the results could have been bad.</div>

<div class="testo_body">I had an incident with another fellow who was faster and much stronger than myself. He walked up and shoved me to the floor. In response, I used Chris Clugston’s “Pop-Up” on this guy, and he went sailing for fifteen feet before he touched the ground. I’m not especially threatening, only 5’9 at 124lbs, I’m not fast, I don’t have much strength, and I’m not violent. However, “Comhrac Bas” ended the incident in less than 3 seconds. I walked away unharmed, while my opponent walked away with a limp that stayed with him for three days. I believe “Comhrac Bas” deserves special praise, its moves are so devastating, and that even the defensive moves can end a fight. When I saw that he was unable to continue the fight, I stopped and walked away. The bad thing is, I only watched Comhrac Bas twice before this happened and never practiced the moves! Thanks.</div>

They gave me the attributes I was missing and the moves nobody else could show me -- at such a reasonable price. If it had cost 500 dollars it would have still been a huge bargain.

<p>Listen closely.</p>
<p>You’re about to learn something that few men outside of U.S. Special Forces and Israeli commandos ever discover.</p>
<p> It's <strong>15 ultra-filthy &quot;no nonsense&quot; fight moves</strong>, taught to you by over a dozen of the world's most feared and dangerous men, that I want you to have...</p>
<h3 id="Co_blue">For FREE.<a href="http://www.fightfast.com/signup_index.php"><img src="http://www.fightfast.com/images/button-linkGoogle.png" alt="Click to Get Your Brutal Fight Enders" width="468" height="103" border="0" id="Image1136" onmouseover="MM_swapImage('Image1136','','http://www.fightfast.com/images/button-linkGoogleh.png',1)" onmouseout="MM_swapImgRestore()"/></a></h3>
<p>I will send it to you today for a very reasonable <em>$7.95 shipping and handling fee</em>. That’s it. No reoccurring fees or any other charges of any kind.</p>
<p> These nasty techniques have been specifically chosen (from thousands) because they're:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Simple. </strong>So easy in fact that nearly ANYONE, no matter what your size, strength or skill level, (even if you've never been in a fight before in your life), can use them.</li>
<li> <strong>Easy to learn.</strong> These moves require NO special knowledge or skills. Watch them just ONCE... practice them if you want... then use it tomorrow if need be. </li>
<li><strong> Devastatingly effective.</strong> The tactics and techniques you'll discover have all been PROVEN in REAL combat &ndash; with blood on the line &ndash; to gain an instant advantage... inflict nightmarish pain... and put an opponent away in seconds.</li>
</ol>
<p> <strong>Here&rsquo;s the story: </strong>My name is Bob Pierce. My little company TRS has been the undisputed industry leader in simplified self-protection instruction for well over 20 years. </p>
<p> I&rsquo;ve literally spent MILLIONS of dollars combing the globe to gather together the world's most accomplished (and vicious) fighters...</p>
<p> ... men who just don't TALK about fighting, but who...</p>
<h3 id="Co_blue"> Have blood on their hands.</h3>
<p> U.S. Special Forces combat soldiers... &quot;black bag&quot; assassins... illegal &quot;cage&quot; fighters... stone-cold street brawlers (with hundreds of street fights under their belt)... </p>
<p> ... ruthless Chicago gang enforcers... decorated DELTA Force Special Operatives... seasoned barroom bouncers... SEAL Team bad-asses... Israeli anti-terrorist killers... Russian Spetnaz experts...</p>
<p> ... and many others.</p>
<p> This is for <em>real</em>.</p>
<p> You're about to get a true insider's peek into an astonishing world of combat instruction that few people ever get a chance to see. <strong>Stuff that can transform you into a mega-dangerous fighter &ndash; very quickly. </strong></p>
<p> Read a few of the &quot;testimonials&quot; on this page. This should help convince you everything I'm saying is absolutely true.</p>
<p> Which is why my unique little company has been getting a lot of attention from some of the biggest magazines inside (and outside) the industry, including&hellip; </p>
<p> <img style="float:right;margin-left:20px;" src="http://www.fightfast.com/trs/images/mags.jpg" width="175" height="310"/>... Men&rsquo;s Journal...</p>
<p> ... Penthouse...</p>
<p> ... Black Belt...</p>
<p> ... Inside Kung Fu...</p>
<p> ... Iron Man... Guns and Ammo... Muscle and Fitness... Men's Fitness...</p>
<p> ... and a lot, lot more. So many that I can't name them all. Really.</p>
<p> I&rsquo;ve had fun pissing-off people along the way too &ndash; especially the martial arts &ldquo;belt factories&rdquo;...</p>
<h3 id="Co_blue"> Who stand to lose a fortune.</h3>
<p> Some guys love me, others hate me. Doesn&rsquo;t really matter. </p>
<p> Fact is, no other company on earth has amassed such an intense arsenal of real-world combat instructional packages (I've produced over 85 titles with nearly 1,000 hours of fight instruction)...</p>
<p> ... taught by top world-class combat experts willing to spill their most treasured fight secrets. </p>
<p> It would be impossible for anyone (even me) to start over and rebuild this collection for any amount of money. (One competitor recently offered me over $1,000,000 just for limited &quot;rights&quot; to it. Sorry... no go).</p>
<p><strong> Which is exactly why this so important to <em>YOU</em>.</strong></p>
<p> Because I want to GIVE you nearly 2 hours of some of the BEST parts of this collection... for <strong>FREE</strong>.</p>
<p>Again, I ask only for $7.95 to cover the shipping and handling fees.</p>
<p> The package is called &quot;Brutal Fight-Enders&quot;... and before I dive into the details, you first need to understand something.</p>
<p> Here it is: On the street... or in the office... playing pool in a bar... walking to the store with your wife... </p>
<p> ... taking a whiz at a gas station... coming out of the movies with your kids... wherever...</p>
<h3 id="Co_blue"> You will most likely be confronted and attacked<br/>
by someone BIGGER and stronger than you.</h3>
<p> It's true. A fact that's been 100% confirmed by FBI &quot;white papers&quot; and crime stats.</p>
<p> Another thing... the police are <em>NOT</em> your personal bodyguards.</p>
<p> No. In fact -- with all due respect -- cops show up AFTERWARDS... to snap grisly photos, draw chalk-lines, write up reports, and clean up the blood.</p>
<p> What's my point? Just this: When it hits the fan -- and some goon decides he likes the look of your wife... or climbs through your kid's bedroom window... or just thinks it'd be funny for him and his buddies to humiliate, beat and rob you...</p>
<p> ... having a handful of simple and devastating moves to quickly dominate and end a confrontation in seconds &ndash; with your opponent shocked, dismayed, and running for his life &ndash; would be extremely valuable to know...</p>
<h3 id="Co_blue"> Wouldn't you agree?</h3>
<p> It also means a major boost to your own personal confidence-level too.</p>
<p> I mean, have you ever noticed how some men... even small guys... can walk into a room and everything changes?</p>
<p> You know... that &quot;EF Hutton&quot; pause when the band stops playing, girls turn their heads, and other guys nervously clear their throats.</p>
<p> It's weird isn't it? Because it's almost NEVER about &quot;good looks&quot;...</p>
<p> ... but that strange and unknown quality called &quot;confidence&quot;. </p>
<p> It attracts women... commands respect and loyalty... and, without saying a word, puts thugs on &quot;notice&quot; that you're not to be messed with.</p>
<p> And once you KNOW &ndash; deep down &ndash; how to inflict instant vicious consequences against anyone who dares screw with you or your family, you will suddenly possess the kind of supreme confidence...</p>
<h3 id="Co_blue"> That others notice<br/>
from across a crowded room.</h3>
<p>And THAT is what this is all about. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>Here&rsquo;s just a small taste</strong> of what's in this intensive 100-minute &ldquo;Brutal Fight Enders&rdquo; DVD package:</p>
<ul class="normal">
<li> How to use a single knuckle-blow (using very little pressure) into an easy-to-hit pressure point to bring a man to his knees in excruciating pain. (It&rsquo;s almost funny to see little kids and small women use this to dominate full grown men).</li>
<li>A very cool &ldquo;upside-down handshake&rdquo; trick used by savvy bar bouncers to stop trouble just as it&rsquo;s about to start. Land him on his knees in seconds with YOU in total control.</li>
<li>A simple &ldquo;human pliers&rdquo; move that will shred through flesh and muscle and send him reeling into shock. It&rsquo;s a bloody and ruthless technique &ndash; but it&rsquo;ll instantly strip away his willingness to fight (and convince ALL his pals that you are NOT playing around).</li>
<li>FOUR simple &ldquo;improvised&rdquo; weapons (I&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;re carrying at least two of them on you right now) that can be instantly lethal when used properly. This is how you&rsquo;ll take ordinary objects and turn them into vicious fighting tools that he WON&rsquo;T be expecting.</li>
<li>A single deadly strike that &ndash; when used correctly &ndash; can (a.) instantly knock him unconscious or &ndash; with slightly more force applied &ndash; (b.) disconnect his spinal cord from his skull. This is as brutal as it get.</li>
<li>A very nifty &ldquo;underhand lace&rdquo; move that uses the back of his neck and the &ldquo;V&rdquo; of your leg to snap his arm like a pretzel while you choke him out. It&rsquo;s wicked and humiliating.</li>
<li>One hell of a brutal &ldquo;shoulder roll&rdquo; leg-bar (very simple to do) for anyone stupid enough to bear-hug you from behind. It&rsquo;s shocking how quick this can &ldquo;pop&rdquo; his knee... and leave him begging for a ride to the emergency room.</li>
</ul>
<p> And much, much more...</p>
<p> ...The vicious &ldquo;distract and pivot&rdquo; that takes advantage of easy soft-targets that MOST people leave wide open... </p>
<p> ...How to properly use your knee cap (most experienced streetfighters don&rsquo;t even know this trick) for<strong> maximum damage</strong>... </p>
<p> ...The punishing &ldquo;nose bridge&rdquo; (looks innocent enough, but <strong>inflicts mind-numbing pain</strong>)...</p>
<p> ...The blinding &ldquo;thumb rake&rdquo; (one hell of a brutal move)... </p>
<p> ...An Israeli Special Forces bone crusher (doesn&rsquo;t require a lot of force, but highly effective in <strong>shattering specific delicate bones</strong>)... and on and on.</p>
<p> It's all here...</p>
<h3 id="Co_blue"> And Plenty MORE!</h3>
<p> This collection is impossible to get anywhere else. It's two decades worth of hard work &ndash; owned and produced by my own company.</p>
<p> Okay... learning these moves does NOT mean you're about to become some kind of knuckle-dragging jerk.</p>
<p> No. You can remain the smart, sweet guy that you are... knowing that you could take care of business if you really had to...</p>
<p> ... handling trouble with a new sense of calm... as if your body were suddenly a cocked and loaded weapon.</p>
<p> People can smell that kind of confidence from a mile away...</p>
<p> ... and punks and criminals tend to stay away. And idiots &ndash; even big dumb idiots &ndash; think twice before starting trouble.</p>
<p> There's nothing quite like the rock-solid surety that comes with knowing how to &quot;take care of business&quot; if you really have to.</p>
<p> It means you can just smile and walk away from silly confrontations... or end it on your terms if things get serious. Your choice.</p>
<p><strong> Here's how to get this now:</strong></p>
<p> As I've said, the &quot;Brutal Fight Enders&quot; DVD package is worth $97, (I've sold this to select clients all over the world), but for a limited time, I will...</p>
<h3 id="Co_blue"> Send it to you...<br/>
for FREE.</h3>
<p> I'll rush one out to you for just $7.95 shipping and handling charge. </p>
<p> <strong>There's nothing to worry about.</strong> You're not joining a club or a membership or anything like that. </p>
<p> There will NOT be any kind of sneaky reoccurring charges. This is a one-time shipping fee ONLY. That's it.</p>
<p> My one hope is that when you see how good this stuff is &ndash; and how it so dramatically improves your confidence level &ndash; that you'll come back and order something else from me, (like I said, I've got 85 packages to choose from).</p>
<p> My small company has already absorbed the enormous cost of producing and editing this material... as well as duplicating the DVDs...</p>
<p> ... so I'm sure you understand that this small fee is absolutely necessary to weed-out the millions of &quot;tire kickers&quot; and keep me from losing my shirt.</p>
<p> To get this DVD rushed out to you now, just click on the button below:</p>

<p> For anyone who takes advantage of this now, I will also include a...</p>
<h3 id="Co_blue"> FREE Bonus!</h3>
<p> I call it &quot;Advanced Fight Enders.&rdquo; Still simple and easy-to-learn, but a tad more advanced. Stuff you&rsquo;ll want to watch a couple times and practice.</p>
<p> Here&rsquo;s just a taste of what you&rsquo;ll discover on this free bonus DVD:</p>
<ul class="check">
<li> How to quickly break free of a rear-naked choke while cracking his ribs and dropping him on his head. Works so fast he won&rsquo;t know WHAT happened... or how he landed in the hospital.</li>
<li> A ferocious (but amazingly simple) &ldquo;Bull Rush Stopper&rdquo; that levels anyone charging you. The more momentum he&rsquo;s got (especially for a big dude), the worse it&rsquo;ll be for him. It&rsquo;s an absolutely merciless tactic... but can save your hide when you really need it.</li>
<li> The beastly little &ldquo;Roll And Throw&rdquo; that uses simple gravity and a cool maneuver to crack his skull like an eggshell. This one&rsquo;s a doosey that he may not survive so be VERY careful when practicing (or you&rsquo;ll have dead training buddy).</li>
</ul>
<p><em> And a lot more.</em></p>
<p> A map of the <strong>pain rich pressure points</strong> around the body... how to use his jaw like your own personal handle (to drive his face straight into the pavement)... </p>
<p> ... instant knockout nerve shots... &ldquo;lock n drop&rdquo; moves that puts YOU in total command... and so much more.</p>
<p> This &quot;Advanced Fight Enders&quot; bonus is crammed with easy to learn fight moves that will take your skills to the next level.</p>
<p> But the best part is that this bonus will also be included in your package...</p>
<h3 id="Co_blue"> For FREE!</h3>
<p>It's a gift from me to you for taking the time to check this out. </p>
<p> I&rsquo;ve included this &quot;Advanced Fight Enders&quot; bonus &ndash; worth $49 all on its own &ndash; in exactly <strong>177</strong> packages as a kind of &quot;shameless bribe&quot; to get you to jump on this now. </p>

<p>We’re calling this interview <em>“Alpha Power Signals” </em>&ndash; because in it, Mr. X very precisely details <strong>how you can discover the SECRETS OF ALPHA MALES.</strong></p>
<p>Cops and professional soldiers learn about “Command Presence” in their tactical training... but command presence goes way beyond tactical skills... in fact, this mysterious Mr. X did an exhaustive study on the non-verbal signs alpha men give off and will describe how you can make them part of your arsenal.</p>
<p>In this interview Mr. X will reveal... the non verbal patterns of dominance, the big cues to recognizing fear in an opponent, how to utilize hand-face movements to control any interaction.</p>
<p>With all that you learn in this amazing interview, you will &ndash; in the space of few moments &ndash; <strong>convince the other guys to realize the drastic mistake of messing with you</strong> usually without incident. You can let him save a little “face” if you decide to, but it’s not necessary.</p>
<p>This is the same stuff that Big City Metro Cops utilize to control groups of people when they’re obviously outnumbered. It’s like learning a completely new universal and non-verbal language.</p>
<p><strong>A language of confidence and dominance </strong>that will make complete strangers notice <em>from across the room. </em>This is critical information that you absolutely want to know.</p>
<p><strong>I will make the link for this available to you for FREE seconds after you agree to receive the Brutal Fight Enders. </strong>It’s another generous gift from me to you.</p>
