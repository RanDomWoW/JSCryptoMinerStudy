      <h2>Update @ 1:15 p.m. CT - New image below with up-to-date schedule!</h2>

<p>You all know how much I love testing stuff. Well, two amazing things have happened this year that gave us an idea. First, Funhaus launched Funhaus TV on their YouTube channel, which has proven to be an amazing way to spend your day with the FH guys and gal (and dog) even though they might not have even posted a new video. Second, the new svod.roosterteeth.com/live went into beta, and you guys flocked to our new chat feature. That got us thinking…</p>

<p><br></p>

















<p>What if there was an always-on campfire on RT.com where you could come by, interact with friends and RT talent and staff in a chat, and check out whatever was on TV?</p>

















<p><br></p>



















<p>Tomorrow we’re trying just that. Starting 3/16 at 10a CT (<a href="https://svod.roosterteeth.com/live/rooster-tv-68">TUNE IN NOW!</a>) and continuing late into the night, free for everyone to watch and with no commercials for the test run, we’ve hacked together a linear TV channel. It’s packed with videos we’ve posted in the last 2 weeks (including previews of some FIRST exclusives), a few other greatest hits from our library, and heck let’s just put Friday's live Off Topic in the middle. You can tune in any time you want and find something awesome playing, plus a few RT talent will pop in and out of the chat too.</p>

















<p><br></p>



















<p>The morning is all cartoons (because of course it is), including the premiere episode of Nomad of Nowhere, plus a little Backwardz Compatible. Whenever Off Topic ends, we’ll dive into more comedy and a few other talk shows like this week’s Always Open and RT Podcast. Late night be sure to check out free previews of the Funhaus Theater Mode premiere episode, and an AH Theater Mode too.</p>

















<p><br></p>



















<p>If this works...I’ll get to buy some cool software to help us make it work better. So please, help me get a new toy. Have fun! (<a href="https://svod.roosterteeth.com/live/rooster-tv-68">Seriously, go tune in and check it out!</a>)</p>

      <p>Hello Chibi Fans! Paula Decanini here, the Director for RWBY Chibi Season 3.  We’ve all been having a great time adventuring and joking around Beacon Academy with the gang, enjoying all the shenanigans and tomfoolery, hoping it could just go on and on and on...</p>

<p><br></p>



<p>Wait!  Am I saying it won’t!?  Don’t be silly! Of course there’s more RWBY Chibi coming!  We’ll be going on a break after this weekend's episode (that's Saturday March 17 for FIRST members, and Saturday March 24 for public) for a few months.  But we'll be back in June with all your favorite Chibi characters, along with a few new friends!  Once again ready for more monkeyshines, high-jinks, and so many other words that stand for fun!  </p>



<p><br></p>



<p>So keep your Saturday morning cartoon cereal at the ready, and we’ll be back this summer!</p>    </div><div class="social-controls">

<p>Can't wait to see everyone's entries! </p>

<p><br></p>



















<p>We’re at the point of the year where all of our planning for RTX Austin is really starting to take form, including the programming!</p>



















<p><br></p>





















<p>Side note - since this is my first introduction to some of you, my name is Clarissa and yes, I’m the one that works on the overall program, which is a bit scary for me to share. I promise I put a lot of time and consideration into how everything is planned out and I truly want you to have the best weekend ever. </p>



















<p><br></p>





















<p>Now, back to the reason I’m here and the exciting news I want to share with you. As a team, we're always thinking about how we can give back to our great community, and at RTX we always aim to go big! In honor of Rooster Teeth’s  “Year of Community”, here are some things to expect this year at RTX Austin.</p>



















<p><br></p>





















<p><strong><em>Community Track</em></strong></p>



















<p>This year we're thrilled to add a dedicated Community Track to our RTX programming lineup. We’ll be allotting 10-12 panels in this new track and we want YOU to submit your panel ideas! </p>





















<p><br></p>



















<p>*Applications will be open from Friday, March 16th at 10AM CDT to Monday, April 16th 11:59PM CDT. We've assembled a committee of Rooster Teeth employees who have come from the community to review and select these panels. </p>





















<p><br></p>



















<p><strong><em>Community Corner</em></strong></p>



















<p>We will have a dedicated space in the Exhibit Hall to promote the work and talents of our community. Are you an artist, designer, illustrator, and/or create cool shit? We'd love to give you the space to show it off! </p>



















<p><br></p>





















<p>* Applications will be open from Friday, March 16th at 10AM CDT to Monday, April, 16th 11:59PM CDT. We've assembled a committee of Rooster Teeth employees who have come from the community to review and select these panels. </p>



















<p><br></p>





















<p>Keep a lookout for both applications on our RTX Austin website (www.rtxaustin.com), Twitter and Facebook page.</p>



















<p><br></p>





















<p>If you're interested in applying, go ahead and start planning out what your type of panel would be and the details around it so you'll be ready when it's time to apply. We can't wait to see all your submissions!</p>



















<p><br></p>





















<p>Lastly, if you have any questions, please remember to reach out to our lovely customer support team at rtxevent@roosterteeth.com. They're here to help!</p>



















<p><br></p>





















<p>xoxo</p>

      <p>Hello everyone! Or as Caboose would say, “Hello everyone!”</p>

<p><br></p>











<p>The other day someone on Twitter mentioned that there has been little in the way of Red vs. Blue news. Well, that changes now. I've come to give you too much information, both about Red vs. Blue and also about myself. Prepare to hear all about Season 16 and this ingrown hair currently buried somewhere under my beard. </p>













<p><br></p>











<p>-Let’s start with RvB. As some have guessed from my carefully worded logline, Season 16 is the beginning of a multi-season arc. The arc has a name but I think I'm keeping the name a secret for now. I will say that the beginning of Season 16 takes place moments after Season 15 ends. I'm pulling a Halloween/Halloween 2 thing. Before you start typing, "There he goes with the motherf-ing references again," DON'T PANIC; by Grabthar's Hammer I promise Season 16 will have way fewer of those. </p>











<p><br></p>













<p>-Several days ago I noticed a skin bump under my beard. I immediately thought, “Oh no, it’s an ingrown hair.” Don’t know if you’ve ever had one of these fucking things but they are really hard to get out. I think if I keep scratching around I can probably pry it out. Fuck, I might need some tweezers. </p>













<p><br></p>











<p>-I have been working on this new season since September. I began with a handful of ideas, and before I knew what was happening, more layers and ideas started to pour out. I gathered them all into a bucket and realized that one bucket wasn’t enough. Right now it's looking like two buckets’ worth of ideas. I don't want to give away too many details, but I will say this season will be epic, absurd, awesome, and perfectly fitting for the Reds and Blues in brand new ways. I'm taking them into uncharted territory. </p>











<p><br></p>













<p>-Speaking of uncharted territory, why does hair grow under skin? This is really fucked up. It's never coming out. I'm just going to ignore it. Ignoring it from now on. </p>













<p><br></p>











<p>-After Season 15 wrapped up, I went and assembled a comprehensive spreadsheet of every critical comment and post I could find, and wrote down what I thought I could learn from each. This was not a fun or easy process, but my life is a quest to become a better storyteller and learning from mistakes is a massive part of that. As a result I've re-tooled my approach to many things. Most things, even. The structure, the storylines, the pacing. I’m not saying that Season 16 will be a magical perfect fit for everyone. I’m am saying that this season, this story that I can’t wait to tell you, will (hopefully) be all the more entertaining and awesome from these lessons learned.</p>













<p><br></p>











<p>-One change these changes this season is that I want to do bigger episodes, which tell more standalone stories. I want each weekly installment fo feel more dense and fulfilling. More story in less time. This comes with the tradeoff of fewer episodes total, but I think it's a good deal. Important: this is not a shorter season. This season will still be one of the longest in runtime, even with fewer (15 or 16) episodes.</p>













<p><br></p>











<p>-If you're curious, ignoring the hair is not working.</p>













<p><br></p>











<p>-Another change this go-around is that I have new responsibilities at RT. Although it's my main focus, RvB16 is not the only thing I'm working on. To assist in the writing of the season, we've brought on Jason Weight (of Starship Goldfish) as my writing partner for the middle/later half of the season. Working with him has been awesome even if we don’t agree on everything (the dumb dumb spells armor with a “u” because he’s “British”).</p>













<p><br></p>











<p>I'll leave you all with this:</p>













<p>The universe is large. There are new places to explore. Some filled with beings of unspeakable power. Other with creatures of light and creatures of darkness. In the dark corners we can find strange, unfamiliar things – and stranger still, familiar things in unfamiliar shapes. There is so much to explore, both without and within. </p>













<p>Red vs. Blue Season 16 will premiere on April 15th, and I think this ingrown hair will torture me for the rest of my life. </p>













<p><br></p>











<p>P.S. I forgot to hint about time travel. </p>













<p><br></p>











<p>P.P.S. I got it! Yippie! </p>    </div><div class="social-controls">
