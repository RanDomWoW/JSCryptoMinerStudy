<p><b>Most subjects are presented excellently in many other encyclopedias,
books and web-pages.</b>  I only felt the responsibility to assemble and
compose the presentations in this Domain when I, as a Theoretical Physicist,
felt that available sources were not strictly scientifically accurate or
not complete.  So the Encyclopedia presentations linked below are generally
different from most other sources, often containing unbearable amounts of
math and logic support for statements made.  As a Public Library
Encyclopedia, this Domain is also unique in <b>not</b> containing <b>any</b> advertising
or promotional links.  From its start in 1997, this Domain has attempted to
be a more technical adjunct to a standard local Public Library.  These
articles are also known to have been written by a respected Theoretical
Physicist, not like the secrecy that Wikipedia maintains where most of its
articles were written by bureaucrats and not scientists. Quora is similar
where thousands of their articles were written by the same half dozen people,
who refer to themselves as &quot;IT pro, part-time physicists&quot; and
similar. Reading many of such articles, I can see where the authors
never received any traditional Physics or Math education.<br><br>

Nearly all of the many thousands of Religious articles included in
this Domain are previously published advanced articles
by religious scholars which are not commonly available to the general public,
traditionally only available in Theological Seminaries for educating Ministry.  
We present most of that religious information in a unique way, where we
present as many as twenty different scholarly articles on a specific subject,
to enable a reader to access many different scholarly perspectives, even
from different religions.  We believe that the Lord Provided each of us
with a brain, which we think He wants us to use!  So we want people to THINK
about the various ideas that respected religious scholars have about some
subject, and then decide which are most valuable for YOU!!<br><br></p>

<center><b>No More, &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Time's Up<br>
An Ideal Woman's Response to Sexual Abuse</b></center><br>

<p>The modern women's groups such as <b>No More</b> and <b>Time's Up</b>
should teach all women and girls a simple behavior response to any time they
are molested or raped.</p>

<p><b>If the man is a boss or a school Teacher or a Priest or a Supervisor
or even a stepfather or father or the United States President, and if he
ejected even a tiny amount of semen onto the clothing of the woman, THAT
DRESS or THAT UNDERWEAR should be very carefully preserved.</b> For example, a (new) air-tight
container such as a sealed bag or a (new) Tupperware container would be
used to store the dress or underwear or other clothing which had gotten
semen onto it.</p>

<p>(Police or experts might suggest some better storage manner, even
possibly such a [new] sealed container inside of a cold freezer or even
inside a Bank Vault or a Bank Security Box.)</p>

<p><b><font color="ff0000">Consider the result of the popular promotion of this idea.</font></b>  <b>ANY MAN
who might consider such a sex crime would likely realize that EVERY TIME
he does such an act, to ANY  woman or girl, he would likely be in real
danger of being arrested and convicted of raping her, and he would not be
able to DENY what he had done to her.</b>  Traditionally, the man has
always pitted one opinion against the other to keep any Judge from ever
accusing him of anything.  <b>NOW, every such man would have to wonder how
many Tupperware bowls exist somewhere that may come back to haunt him,</b>
with a true likelihood that a Judge would find him Guilty and therefore
Convicted, <b>of every single time he tries to do such sex crimes to
any girls or men</b></p>


<p>At whatever time when they wake up or are otherwise in a safe place,
the victim(s) should carefully examine all of their clothing and underwear and
possible bed sheets for any indications that any tiny drops of semen may have
touched any of the cloth.  A new Tupperware bowl or equivalent should be
obtained to be able to place and store the clothing safely inside, where
no additional contamination would occur to the clothing.   This reasoning
is based on the unique nature of every man's DNA, which is always in all of
his semen.  At any future time (of her choosing), a Medical Facility or Hospital
could recover that clothing and obtain DNA samples, which could not have
come from any other source than the man who had sexually abused the girl
or woman.  <b>A Judge could take this indisputable evidence to arrest and
convict the man of the sex crime he had committed.</b></p>

If you have ever done an Ancestry DNA kit, you know that a tiny amount
of your DNA from a mouth swab is all that is needed to uniquely identify
you regarding your ancestry, and DNA samples are durable. <b>ANY man who
pursues sexual abuse needs to wonder how many sealed Tupperware bowls
might be waiting somewhere to cause him to be arrested and convicted
and jailed for each such behavior.<br><br>  Maybe the behavior of all men might
suddenly improve.</b><p><br><br>



<p style="font-size:large"><b><a href="http://mb-soft.com/public4/guncontr.html">Gun Control in America, Military Assault Weapons</a></b></p>
I would have thought that the established fact that 19,000 people kill
themselves with guns every year, <b>which is more than 50 suicide deaths every day</b>
might seem newsworthy, but apparently, suicide deaths by guns must be
a forbidden subject.  Would our attitudes toward having more guns in
America than people change if half of the front page of every newspaper
mentioned and discussed the 50 people who intentionally killed themselves
that day?  But apparently, the deaths of those 50 people were not as
important as a spectacular crash where ONE person died and the front page
news stories invariably discuss the wives and children of the person who
had accidentally died in that crash.  Have you ever noticed that the
wives, children, and parents of those 50 gun suicide deaths (every day) are
never mentioned in any newspaper or TV news reports?<p><br><br>

be gone.<br></p>


<p style="font-size:medium">
<b>A hundred gallon barrel can be filled with excellent water

The barrels would be accelerated up to exactly 200.0 mph,
with a computer on board each to maintain that exact speed, inside a very
long, very straight standard three-foot diameter reinforced concrete
culvert (resembling a sewer). Similar to the US Alyeska crude oil pipeline, an
aircraft jet engine can produce a 230-mph tailwind behind the barrels.

<b>Each barrel of water would &quotfly&quot; 1,200 miles

can pass every second, or 1800 barrels every minute or 108,000 barrels

<p style="font-size:20px"><b><a href="http://mb-soft.com/solar/index.html">Solar Heated House</a></b></p>
<img src="solar/solar5a.jpg" width="457" height="326" align="right" alt="100% NorthWarm Solar Model House">
<b>Comfort that Americans Expect without needing any Fossil Fuels</b><br><br>
<b>NorthWarm Totally 100% Solar-Heated House - Version 1</b>.<br><br>
<b>A Truly 100% Solar-Heated Home for most any climate at an affordable price</b><br><br>

This <b>NorthWarm Solar</b> house design is a revolutionary improvement in
modern housing.  The hybrid passive-active design is based on a US Patented
device.  <b>It allows total heating of the ENTIRE house in a climate like
Chicago's or even in some areas of Alaska!</b>  Even if there is only
ONE sunny day every week!  Or even if
there is only 1.5 hours of sunshine per day!  As an odd added bonus, the house
may NOT even need air-conditioning in the summer (in many climates),
which means further savings on the utility bills.<p>

<b>The NorthWarm Solar (Version 1 or 2) approach to solar heating is VERY different
from anyone else's approach.  It is a TWO-STAGE system, which GUARANTEES
incredible comfort and performance.  One of our basic &quot;secrets&quot; is
that we do NOT actually heat the house with solar heat!</b>  We provide an enormous
UNDERGROUND, thermally insulated heat-storage chamber (under the house) where
we send tens of millions of Btus of solar heat into.  During every sunny hour, 
we collect massive amounts of solar heat to
FOREVER maintain this (huge) heat-storage chamber at 125&#176;F (or warmer) 
temperature. Relatively conventional air-handling blowers and ducting then 
transfer 125&#176;F warm air (identical to the warm air that your conventional
house furnace now provides from fossil fuels) to any room where that wall
thermostat calls for warm air.  This approach has many bonuses, such as
having a (conventional) bathroom wall thermostat set at 90&#176;F while a bedroom might be
maintained at 68&#176;F and a living room maintained at 74&#176;F.  Few current
homes have such customized heating systems!<p>

For Northwarm Solar (Version 1 or 2) homes in some climates, the homeowner
also can install an additional underground, thermally insulated storage
chamber, but this one for natural deep-soil COOLNESS (of 52&#176;F).  This
then provides an even more
amazing comfort ability!  Some rooms of the house could be HEATED
(in response to those rooms' wall thermostats) while other rooms
could be COOLED, AT THE SAME TIME!  In existing houses, THAT is
impossible!  But in a NorthWarm Solar home, it can be &quot;normal&quot;.
<b>A Cooled Pantry could maintain wines and foods at 52&#176;F without needing
the expense of running any expensive refrigeration system, while a
different room might be kept at 100&#176;F as a Sauna!</b>  Who else could do
that, and all WITHOUT expensive cooling and heating equipment?<p>

Each NorthWarm Solar (Version 1 or 2) House can have the heating (and cooling)
system custom designed for that family's desires and their climate.  <b>In fact,
for a climate like Chicago's, the heat-storage chamber could be over-sized
so that NO direct solar panels might be necessary at all, that heat
collected from the previous summer might be collected and saved to
HEAT THE ENTIRE HOUSE FOR THE ENTIRE COMING WINTER!</b>  If a NorthWarm Solar
(Version 1) house was built in some parts of Alaska, the underground heat-storage
chamber would similarly be over-sized, such that the minimal amount of
available winter solar energy would still easily always keep the entire house
cozy.  It must be clear that essentially any other climate in Canada
or Europe or the United States or China could similarly use the NorthWarm Solar
System.  Oddly, this approach of a two-stage heating/cooling system
could also be Engineered for climates like southern Florida or Arizona,
again, always for the absolute ultimate in comfort for all occupants.<p>

You might have noticed that much of the Technology involved
in a NorthWarm Solar (Version 1 or 2) house is all hidden underground,
so (Version 1) designs have immense flexibility regarding style and
appearance.  The ultimate performance style would involve some very
large glass windows (or panels) for maximum collection of solar warmth,
but the NorthWarm Solar design concept could use many other methods of supplying
heat to send into the underground heat-storage chamber, even a woodstove
or a wood-burning furnace or even a conventional fossil-fuel burning furnace!  But we
frown on that, as that would defeat many of the FREE capabilities of the
NorthWarm Solar concept and design.  The NorthWarm Solar heat-storage
can also supply heat to make a vehicle garage cozy warm as desired, and
it can also send heat through air tubes under sidewalks and driveways
to keep them forever ice- and snow-free.  An amazing system! (1978)<br></p><br>




<p style="font-size:large"><b><a href="http://mb-soft.com/solar/saving.html">Home Air Conditioning</a>.</b></p>
<b>Free home A/C, Natural, GREEN, Save $2,000 every summer.</b><p>
You have visited a (cool) cave on a hot summer day. This concept uses the
Physics of why that occurs to provide an array of (sealed) underground air
passageways, to send your hot house air down there to cool (and also
dehumidify) the house air <b>NATURALLY</b>, without any Freon and without
any giant electric bill from running a noisy central Air Conditioner. Comfort
and conventional wall-thermostat convenience is as wonderful as with standard
compressor-driven air conditioning! Right now, day or night, summer or
winter, eight feet deep below me (near Chicago), the deep soil is ALWAYS at
52&#176;F temperature, and we USE that fact to recirculate hot house air through
sealed air tubes down there to cool and dehumidify it. I do not charge for
the free construction information, and in the past 17 years, more than 23,000
people have already installed it to cool their whole homes!  Those
home owners SAVE $40,000,000 every year on their electric bills!<br><br>

There IS a way you can spend some money regarding this! <b>Few people need
this</b> but I offer a &quot;Technical Packet&quot; for anyone who
feels they have unusual aspects of their installation, but they are
required to give $250 anonymously to any worthy Charity such as a Food Bank,
a Homeless Shelter, a Soup Kitchen, an Animal Shelter, or equivalent. At
least 9,600 people have requested the TP so far, so they have collectively
given at least $2,400,000 to wonderful activities that needed the money.

<p style="font-size:large"><b>I sometimes wonder if I am the only person who cares
about the 300,000 Americans who are soon likely to die in the San Andreas Fault
and Hayward Fault overdue disastrous magnitude 9.0 Earthquakes.</b> Experts
all agree that strict scientific analysis indicates that the main San
Andreas earthquake should have occurred around 1975 and that the main
Hayward earthquake should have occurred around 2005.  They are both very
overdue, now having constantly built up underground stresses that the
rock layers can not long endure.<br><br>

<b><a href="http://mb-soft.com/public3/calquake.html">Earthquakes are Natural Events that cannot be Avoided</a>.</b></p><p>
<b>Earthquakes are generally events that we know WHERE they will occur.
They are very dangerous because we do not know WHEN they will occur. We can
solve that problem by artificially triggering the unavoidable earthquake,
on a day when we have already evacuated all the people and animals from the
region.  We already do this same process in artificially triggering snow
avalanches in ski resorts, using dynamite and at night.  The avalanches are
unavoidable natural events which can kill people but by artificially
triggering them to happen when no one is around to be hurt, the avalanche
problem is eliminated.  I want to do that same process for earthquakes
such as the San Andreas or the Hayward in California.</b><br><br>
<b>We Can Absolutely Eliminate any California Earthquake Deaths EVER!</b><br><br><br>
<b>We Can Use Relatively Conventional Mining Equipment and Processes to Artificially Trigger Unavoidable Earthquakes After We Have Evacuated Everyone From the Region.</b></p><p>

A one-day area mandatory evacuation to free parties, free concerts, free sports, and other free entertainment out in the desert would get people, pets and zoo animals to safety. Then conventional mining techniques and a precise series of boreholes exactly into a Fault Line and down to exactly the correct depth, and conventional dynamite charges and mining-like artificially-triggered timing could trigger artificial earthquakes to shake the Fault sides and therefore release accumulated stresses in the Earth. Decades or generations of long-term safety could be ensured. <b>CURRENT politics aspires to get people only around TWENTY SECONDS of warning before an impending major earthquake.  It seems to me that MOST people will still die.</b>  Doesn't it make far better sense to use my approach, to give EVERYONE in Southern California FIFTY YEARS of perfect safety? (first realized in September 2001, first presented on the Internet in March 2011)<br><br><br></p>





<p style="font-size:large"><b><a href="http://mb-soft.com/public/fouruniv.html">
Origin of the Universe</a></b>.</p><p> The Big Bang Theory is immensely
popular, but only because virtually no one understands the exotic Elliptical 
Curved-Space Riemannian Geometry Tensor Calculus on which it is based.
Also, the fact that all Physicists are willing to abandon all the known and
accepted Laws of science for it (which are all based on Euclidean [or Plane]
Geometry).<br><br>

Much better than the very illogical Big Bang Theory, <b>this
concept is a solidly logical explanation for the beginning of the
Universe, which is based on actual experiments that many Physicists (including me) have
performed, which are called &quot;Pair Production&quot; experiments,
where the Physicist ACTUALLY CREATES BRAND NEW particles or photons in a
laboratory (out of NOTHING)</b>.<br><br>

Give me a few billion Physics students (and equipment) and a few billion
years for them to work at doing Pair Production experiments, and I could
make you a modest-sized Universe, one particle at a time!<br><br>

This is far better than requiring an impossibly and illogical
rapid explosion of everything in the entire
Universe in an impossibly brief 10<sup>-35</sup> second. The traditional Big
Bang then continues the neglect for logic and reality by claiming that there
was an Inflation where the entire Universe then expanded by a factor of
10<sup>+50</sup> from a sub-atom-sized invisibly tiny (10<sup>-24</sup> meter) speck to
its current huge size in another 10<sup>-32</sup> second. Those proponents
overlook the impossibility for all those countless trillions of tons of mass
to ACCELERATE up to speeds billions of times faster than the Speed of Light
for such a ridiculous instant expansion to actually happen!<br><br>

The Creation of the Universe may actually be a very logical process (which
Physicists call <b>&quot;Pair Production&quot;</b>) which Physics Students
regularly perform in lab experiments.  These experiments are kind of weird
to a young Physics student in that you are actually CREATING two brand-new
particles or photons, out of absolutely NOTHING. In High School I was taught
the &quot;Conservation of Mass&quot; and the &quot;Conservation of Energy&quot;
where no one was supposed to be able to do such things! It may be a SLOW and
gradual process which may occur one photon and nuclear particle at a time and
it might STILL be ongoing! (Theory originally created in 1960, published on
the Internet in 1998).<br><br><br></p>





<p style="font-size:large"><b><a href="http://mb-soft.com/public4/neutrino.html">Neutrinos Do Not Exist</a></b></p><p>Incorrect logic was used in trying to explain how and why a Neutron can beta-decay into a Proton and an Electron every 15 minutes.

<b>Nuclear Spin is a Vector quantity and not a Scalar quantity as Pauli had incorrectly assumed</b>.<br>

<b>Angular Momentum (Nuclear Spin) IS ALWAYS CONSERVED.</b>
Pauli had dreamed up the need for Neutrinos (with another [Scalar] Spin of 1/2 unit) because he misunderstood and thought that Angular Momentum was NOT Conserved and incorrectly assumed that it was a Scalar addition! <b>In 1930, he even publicly announced this 1/2 = 1/2 + 1/2 + (-1/2) as his Scalar addition explanation of the Nuclear Spin (referring to neutron spin = proton spin + electron spin + (anti-neutrino spin) where he explained that it had to be an anti-neutrino because that would spin the other way around and therefore be the negative sign so his Scalar addition worked properly.</b><br><br>
There is even additional statistical scientific evidence that Neutrinos do not exist in the highly respected and precise NIST data resource.  In addition, all Physicists have always overlooked that free-ranging Neutrons certainly DO beta-decay every fifteen minutes, but that constant beta-decaying OF EVERY ATOM OF EVERY ELEMENT cannot happen inside the nuclei of all atoms, as there would be tremendous Energy Conservation issues with the Neutron Self-Binding Energy constantly appearing and disappearing in there.

Nuclear Physics May be Fairly Simple</a>.</b></p><p>  <b>Atomic Nuclei May
Not Contain Neutrons or Neutrinos.  Only LOOSE Protons and Electrons may
exist inside Atomic Nuclei.</b>  Traditional Nuclear Physics thinking
involves MANY different types of objects whizzing around inside all atomic
nuclei, which can NEVER precisely comply with the math of Conservation of
Energy and the Conservation of Mass.  This NEW approach greatly simplifies
the interior structure of each atomic nucleus, but equally important, <b>it
now PRECISELY displays EXACT mathematical addition of the components to
totally confirm the Conservation of Energy and Mass.</b>  Modern NIST data
for the energy involved in each nuclear object is known to better than ten
decimal points precision, and each &quot;addition problem&quot; now has EXACT
results!  In addition, everything now is much more LOGICAL and also
SIMPLER!<br><br>

An example is the beta-decay of a Tritium atom, which is now <b>EXACT!</b>
According to the very reliable government NIST database, a decaying
Hydrogen/Tritium atom, <b><sup>3</sup>H<sub>1, </sub></b> has a precise
atomic mass of <b><font size="4"> 3.0160492779 AMU </font></b>
(Atomic Mass Units). That atom naturally beta-decays into a resulting
Helium-3 atom, <b><sup>3</sup>He<sub>2,</sub></b> which has a
precise atomic mass of <b><font size="4"> 3.0160293201 AMU.</font></b>
The NIST data also confirms that the Tritium atom also
gives off radiation (of <b><font size="4">0.0000199578 AMU</font></b> energy),
with a half-life of 12.33 years.  <b>Do the math!  It adds up EXACTLY,
confirming the Conservation of Mass and Energy.</b> EVERY other nuclear
process now also shows precise math!<br><br>

Traditionally, all previous attempts to do that math have always failed
due to not being able to account for the enormous (0.78235 MeV) Neutron
Self-Binding Energy that is REQUIRED to hold every neutron together.  (1996, 2003, 2014)</p>

Breast Cancer Treatment with DNA and Stem Cells</a>.</b></p><p> The current
method of dealing with breast cancer invariably does massive damage to the
woman with serious Surgery, dangerous Radiation Therapy and powerful
Chemical Medications.  We see a <b>NATURAL WAY</b> to proceed to be a far
better approach which seems to make a lot of sense. <b>An Archived copy of
that woman's unique own CHILDHOOD DNA contains FLAWLESS UNIQUE PERSONAL
DNA instructions which could be used (again) BY HER OWN BODY to grow the
precise correct amino acids to grow the necessary proteins to grow NEW,
PERFECT CANCER-FREE breasts.</b>  <b>We note that she did it perfectly
successfully as a teenager, and we believe THAT HER OWN BODY could use
her (flawless) UNIQUE childhood DNA to do it again to replace a cancerous
breast as an adult.</b> NO adverse effects should happen to the woman,
who comes out of this as a wonderful, COMPLETE person as though no cancer
had ever occurred to her!<br><br></p>

If this works, then we also wonder if the flawless unique childhood DNA of a
child who lost an arm due to injury or illness might use those DNA
instructions to have his or her body (somehow) grow a brand-new flawless
arm, absolutely perfectly matched to the rest of his or her body.
I recognize that connecting the countless nerve interneurons may
be beyond human technology, but the idea that a child (or even adult) might
be able to involve Stem cells to grow a complete new limb seems intriguing.
Of course, in that case, for a person to be able to grow an entire new
head of hair or an entire new set of perfectly natural teeth, might be
even easier for the Medical community to do.  What about a perfectly
natural new liver, perfectly suited for that unique person due to the
uniqueness of the DNA information?  A new kidney, or a heavy smoker being
able to grow a brand new lung?  Even a brand new heart?<br><br>

Therefore, we only know the mass of the Earth or of the Moon or of the Sun

to gravitational attraction, where it cannot be affected by anything else.
The tiny satellite would take a week or two to orbit the spacecraft, but we
could monitor that orbital radius and period duration, to accurately know

<p>Imagine a kilometer-long pendulum hung down a narrow borehole.  There would
be no air drafts and no temperature difference so the pendulum would always
hang exactly straight down. However, at Moonrise every day, the Lateral
Vector Lunar gravitational effect would pull the pendulum sideways, around
3.39 millimeters toward the East. Some hours later at Moonset, the pendulum
would be pulled the other way, toward the West, a comparable distance. With
laser interferometry equipment, those exact positions could be measured to
a fraction of a wavelength of light (or around 3.38561456 millimeters). The
experiment even repeats every day so we get even better data.  We can know

<p style="font-size:large"><b><a href="http://mb-soft.com/public4/elect888.html">Solar Electricity - Energy Method Based on Natural Updraft</a></b>.</p><p>  Many Birds and Glider Pilots know how to circle to fly without flapping or needing any AvGas or birdfood.  This is a natural process of
<b>Thermals</b> or <b>Updrafts</b> to fly without needing power.  Solar energy gets absorbed into BLACK DIRT which heats the ground up and creates a natural vertical air CONVECTION CELL where warm air rises.  Now we know how to capture this solar energy to produce electricity. For this device, we add a little Technology to surround that rising warm air in a large diameter CHIMNEY, and then cover it, trap it, with a vertical-axis windmill-type turbine. The trapped rising air HAS TO drive the turbine blade, per the Conservation of Energy and Technology that William Rankine discovered long ago.  The spinning central vertical axle shaft of that turbine drives a (standard automotive) alternator to create electricity.  Quite cheap to build and relatively indestructible! A small, 5-foot-diameter device can supply a maximum 700 Watts of electricity, around 4 kiloWatt-hours of electricity on a full sunny day.
A 20-foot-diameter device should supply about 64 kiloWatt-hours of electricity on a full sunny day.  This is not as efficient as the Tornado approach, and it only works during sunny days, but producing enough electricity for a family is easy and cheap. (2015)<br><br></p>

That is actually droplets of pure water from the humidity in the room.  This works outdoors, too.  Virtually all outdoor air contains significant water vapor or humidity in it.  We can take that humid air and blow it down through a long sloped underground tube, which is cool, so some of that humidity condenses out.

<p style="font-size:large"><b><a href="http://mb-soft.com/public4/gravit87.html">Possible New Approach to Experimentally Creating Fusion Energy</a></b>.</p>
<p>We may be wrong regarding understanding how the Sun works. All scientists think that the enormous mass of the Sun, 330,000 times that of the Earth, gravitationally crushes the Core of the Sun with enormous pressure there which then causes enormous temperatures of millions of degrees Kelvin. We have long believed that such enormous temperatures in the Core of the Sun cause enormous velocity of hydrogen nuclei such that they collide together to create Nuclear Fusion energy in producing Helium nuclei which then radiates from the surface of the Sun (and all other stars) to power our survival here on Earth. <b>Three hundred years ago, the brilliant Isaac Newton invented Integral Calculus and with it he discovered an amazing aspect of gravitation</b>. His Gravitation formula is a Vector Calculus equation which calculates the attraction between massive objects.
Inside the Earth, Newton developed his &quot;Shell Theorems&quot; (using his Integral Calculus) and calculated that only the mass which happens to be beneath you provides gravitation, since all the mass above wherever you are has the Vector gravitational force cancel out. Newton mathematically proved that this is true for all symmetric objects, including the Sun and stars. We scientists have always ASSUMED that all of the impressive mass of the Sun acts to gravitationally collapse the Core, to produce enormous pressure and therefore temperature of many millions of degrees Kelvin, which could then cause Hydrogen atoms to fuse together into Helium (called Nuclear Fusion). But Newton had proven with his Calculus that does not and cannot happen. There is actually virtually NO gravitational collapse at the center of the Sun, or in any other stars. <b>So how can the Sun and stars shine?</b><br><br></p>

<p style="font-size:large">Time Dilation is just an <b>Appearance</b> and not actually a reality.</p>
<p style="font-size:large"><b><a href="http://mb-soft.com/public4/dilations.html">Understanding Time Dilation due to Special Relativity</a>.</b></p><p>  Most people, including scientists,
misunderstand what Time Dilation is. They envision it as a more &quot;real&quot; phenomenon where they then imagine &quot;time travel&quot; and other speculative ideas. The reality is that an Observer, such as on Earth, can watch some examples of where the rate of time passage SEEMS to change, but where he (and the Earth) can never EXPERIENCE such things. They can ONLY watch such effects of time passage in their telescopes when they watch people or objects which happen to be traveling at ferocious velocity, either toward or away from the telescope, and then the APPEARANCE of Time Dilation is seen. However, interestingly, the actual person or object being watched is NOT affected at all, and at that location, time passes exactly as it has always been expected to pass. Neither of the two scientists, as Observers, actually experience anything odd. Weirder still, as an Observer, if that distant scientist looks back at Earth in his own telescope, he sees the Earth (and you) appear to be aging slowly.<br><br></p>

<p style="font-size:large"><b><a href="http://mb-soft.com/public4/teeth.html">Grow New Adult Teeth on Demand</a>.</b></p><p> As adults, we do not have the ability to grow new teeth and we have to have a Dentist install artificial teeth.  However, all young children have an amazing capability that neither of the parents can do, <b>that of growing a brand new ADULT tooth each time each Baby Tooth falls out.</b>  Our Research suggests that SOME DNA base pairs seem to have a time-schedule for when they can initiate the amino acid and then protein formation, which seems to be true, for a few years, for children to have that &quot;New Adult Teeth&quot; capability.  Our Research suggests that if a (UNIQUE) PRIOR PERSONAL childhood DNA data set is held in archive, then it should be possible for that (adult) person to re-grow brand new teeth when any are lost as an adult.  This approach might enable billions of adults to grow a full set of brand new natural teeth! The same functionality of time-limited
DNA activity may initiate Alzheimer's or Parkinson's or new hair growth in elderly people, where that archived childhood FLAWLESS DNA might be able to initiate reconstruction and replacement of contaminated tissues with FLAWLESS NEW tissues for a wonderful life!<br><br></p>

<p><b>In a given 24-hour day, an adult man likely eats foods and liquids that
contain a total of about 189 grams of carbon atoms. In the roughly
17,000 times he exhales every day, he exhales about 0.011 gram of carbon
atoms as part of the carbon dioxide in every exhaled breath or a total
of about 189 grams of carbon atoms every day.
This normally keeps his weight and bodyfat rather constant!</b></p>

<p><b><a href="http://mb-soft.com/public3/weight.html">Bodyfat, Weight Loss, the Physics of Body Weight Control</a>.</b></p> 

<p><b>By the way, 189 grams is nearly HALF A POUND EVERY DAY!  Or THIRTEEN
POUNDS EVERY MONTH!</b>  If he could avoid ALL eating for a month (total
Fasting), he would still be breathing (exhaling) and his body WOULD have to
use up thirteen pounds of his stored bodyfat to survive and be active!</p>

<p style="font-size:large"><b>Amazingly, how you breathe has a tremendous effect on
whether you gain or lose weight!</b>.</p>

<p>This Weight/Diet Research was first placed on the Internet in October 2009</p>

<p>A thorough examination of the Physics involved provides new insights into
evaluating the many weight-loss programs sold today. It does not appear that
ANY of the thousands of (alleged) weight-loss programs that are sold actually
consider the actual science involved! The foods you eat are primarily atoms
of hydrogen, oxygen and carbon. YOU are more than 94% C, H and O atoms.
A basic law of science is called the
Conservation of Mass, where nothing can just disappear. Getting rid of
used and discarded hydrogen and oxygen atoms is easy, usually as water
in sweat, urination, or exhaled water vapor. Some companies know that
some chemicals act as Diuretics, which make you urinate a lot more than
normal, which gets rid of WATER so your weight seems to drop! But your
brain knows to get you to drink more water for health purposes, and the
weight comes back. <b>Actual body weight is much more dependent on carbon
atoms and nearly all of the molecules in you are partially carbon atoms</b>.
Unfortunately, the human body really only has one easy process of getting
rid of used carbon atoms, as part of the carbon dioxide molecules your
lungs exhale.<br></p>

<p>No one seems to know this rather basic scientific fact! Any attempt for you
to either gain or lose weight needs to consider this situation. For
example, you could exercise to increase your Metabolic Rate and your
Respiration Rate, toward losing weight. Sweat and exhale deeper and faster.

<p style="font-size:large"><b><a href="http://mb-soft.com/public4/gravity7.html">Newtonian Gravitational Constant Accuracy</a>.</b></p><p>  Science has made a variety of logical errors which cause the poor precision of the value of 'Big G'.  During the past 40 years, more than a dozen very careful experiments have been done to try to determine the precise value of G, but the results have been in amazing disagreement with each other.  The primary cause for this problem is that all scientists seem to overlook the existence of the Moon in our Earth-Moon gravitational system.  The Earth and Moon form a &quot;gravitational Barycenter&quot; as sort of a balancing point which the Earth rotates around every day and revolve around every month.  The Barycenter is actually deep inside the Earth, just over a thousand miles deep, about 2902 miles away from the actual center of the Earth, and <b>it is stationary</b> but the body (center) of the Earth rotates around it at around 793 mph due to our daily rotating.
Our Earth also monthly revolves around the Barycenter at about 27 mph due to the Moon's orbiting. These constant movements result in constant gravitational tugs on everything up here on the surface back and forth (several times every day!) A delicate gravitational experiment gets affected, both regarding the STRENGTH of the Gravitational Force Vector and also (slightly) as to the DIRECTION of that Vector pull.  All those careful experiments have never accounted for this Vector Force Addition effect, so the experiments which were done in China or Italy or the United States have given results which have not agreed.  Some advanced mathematics could calculate the precise location of the Barycenter at the moment each earlier experiment had been done, to make the necessary corrections to correct the values of 'Big G' for each experiment.  There seems no doubt that wonderful consistency and precision will then greatly improve the value of the actual Newtonian Gravitational Constant. (2017)<br><br><br></p>

You may be able to produce a CONSTANT 9 KiloWatts of electricity from Solar for your home for around $2,000 total cost.<br><br>
Three separate stages:<br><br> Collect solar energy into water in a calm, insulated pond during sunny hours (nearly 100% efficiency).<br><br>
Use some of the warmed (85&#176;F or 30&#176;C or warmer) water to create and drive a small artificial tornado, 24 hours a day, safely inside a silo building.<br><br>
Use UV lamps to ionize that spinning air to produce alternating magnetic fields to create substantial electricity by the Faraday Effect. (around 40% conversion efficiency) (2006)</p><p> (In 2015, NOAA discovered that warm 76&#176;F ocean water was the secret behind the energy of how hurricanes start, something that I had been experimentally using for nine years to artificially make my 90 little tornadoes in my basement, except that I had always thought that 85&#176;F was necessary!)<br><br>
<b>Make yourself around a continuous 9 KiloWatts of electricity (or 200 kiloWatt-hours every day) with a small controlled artificial tornado!</b> We do not really need (fossil fuels) coal, natural gas or petroleum to power our society. <b>Nature has provided us with an ideal technology!</b> It's actually just simple Physics! The Sun WARMS a small (20-foot or 6-meter diameter), calm pond up to around 85&#176;F or 30&#176;C, using maybe 25 KiloWatts of sunlight power. Some of that warmed water EVAPORATES, which removes around 970 Btu (or 0.28 kiloWatt-hour) of energy per pound (a lot) up out of the water. But then the rising warmed air immediately cools so some of the water vapor condenses out as tiny fog droplets (which are now visible). This now RELEASES a lot of that power (maybe 15 KiloWatts) which had started out as
Solar heat. Most of that energy now becomes Kinetic Energy of the air above the warm water SPINNING. (Conservation of Energy again.) <b>This is actually how tornadoes form.</b> (I made more than 90 small artificial tornadoes in 2006, 2009 and 2010. If you have had a cup of [hot] coffee in a cool room, you may have seen a wisp of &quot;wet steam&quot; form and in a dead calm air room, you may have even seen that slowly rising visible steam start to [naturally] twist by the same Coriolis process!). Then, we use (standard) Ultraviolet lights to IONIZE that spinning air which electrically charges it. This creates a circulating electrical current in the air, somewhat resembling the way circulating ionized iron inside the Earth creates its magnetic field. Many coils of wire are suspended on the inside silo walls surrounding the spinning charged air, which detect the ALTERNATING MAGNETIC FIELDS which pass through the coils of wire (by Faraday's Law). This generates an EMF, or electricity! <b>9 KiloWatts of
produced electricity is realistic. Electricity is produced as long as there is warm water, even during the night!</b>  The device I invented resembles an old farm silo, which keeps the [small] enclosed tornado from ever becoming dangerous. Millions of these devices could quickly and inexpensively (around $2,000 each) be built, of &quot;rolled steel tubing&quot; to supply all the electricity that mankind could dream of!

There are around 75 million families in the U.S. Instead of giving that monthly (new) $85 billion to giant Corporations, which actually have not used it productively, <b>imagine instead that Bernacki chopped up that monthly $85 billion into 75 million equal parts, and he mailed or electronically transferred $1,133 to each and every American family EVERY MONTH FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS!</b>
What would have been the result of this? Many millions of those 75 million families would have SPENT much of that &quot;monthly windfall&quot; and ALL American businesses would have had
financial prosperity! Even a more conservative family who might not have wanted to SPEND the $68,000 that the Fed would have given them, might have PAID OFF $50,000 of College Loans, or paid off Credit Cards or similar things.

Rather than using a mechanical trigger, this uses a 25,000 Volt spark to ignite the gunpowder.  It is COMPUTERIZED and DIGITAL so it could only be fired while an embedded COMPUTER PASSWORD was in effect. That password process could require a biometric thumbprint match. (January 2013)<br><br></p><p>
A gun owner could have as many weapons as desired (per the Second Amendment) but no one could ever fire any of them except for after the Biometric thumbprint-matched Owner activated them (a few seconds), and <b>even that owner would need to &quot;re-new&quot; the password after 12 hours.</b>  Therefore, no child could ever find a loaded gun in a closet and kill a sister. <b>No young man could find his mother's guns and take them to Sandy Hook to kill twenty beautiful little children.</b>
No one could kill people in a movie theater, or even out at a Congresswoman's visit to a Mall.  In fact, ONLY the Thumbprint-matched Owner could EVER activate that gun to be fired. <br><br><b>Are you aware that EVERY YEAR, around 19,000 of the people who commit suicide in the United States use a gun to do it?</b> Think about that. The Thumbprint identified owner is rarely that person! This suggests that this idea might eliminate nearly 19,000 deaths by suicide in the US each year. Just that seems worth doing this!
Also, <b>Guns would probably no longer be stolen from homes as they could never be fired by the thieves!</b>  Street Gangs might have great trouble in constantly getting the passwords updated for all their weapons, INCLUDING their Assault Weapons. <br><br>We believe that <b>EVERY existing gun could be quickly, easily and inexpensively altered or replaced to only be functional for a period of 12-hours by a thumbprint embedded password.</b>
Gun owners would have the best of all worlds,
in having access to unlimited supplies of the weapons they love, <b>while ensuring that the public will never be injured by any of those weapons.</b>  Their only slight inconvenience would be a two-second process of having their thumbprint recognized!<br><br> From a different perspective, it seems to me that there are at least two entirely different interpretations of the United States Constitution Second Amendment. I don't see that anywhere in its text is there any reference to being allowed to carry weapons absolutely anywhere.  It seems to me that the Second Amendment text instead makes very clear that <b>any American has a right to have and use weapons on one's own property.</b>
In other words, as per the stated &quot;right of the people to keep and bear Arms&quot; to defend one's own family and property. NOT to be capable of winning street fights or flaunting one's ego!<br></p>

There is apparently an even larger problem than the New Orleans Saints Coaches which exists. In 1998, I spent my usual weeks around Christmas centered on playing Beach Volleyball around Ft. Lauderdale Florida.  We strong players would play from around 10 am to noon, when the College tourist players would start showing up and we had to give up the net.  But I sometimes got my Beach Doubles partner to agree to try to hold the net, against the six College guys who wanted to take over. Those College boys never realized how good we were, but I would get them to agree to the &quot;formality&quot; of the sixes team needing to win the Beach from the Twos team. Our team of two players generally could win game after game against
teams of College sixes. On that particular day, a young boy, a 14-year-old High School sophomore had been watching us. When my Beach Partner finally got bored with playing against weak competition and left, I was left with no partner, even though I still had the Beach, so I asked the kid if he knew how to play.  He played pretty well and the two of us held the beach for another two hours against the College sixes teams.  We only actually stopped because I was getting very hungry and thirsty, but then we talked and I mentioned to him that there was then a restaurant which had a very popular lit night volleyball court, where I went to play each evening.  So he showed up there and we were able to play some more and then talk.  This was to be my last day in Florida before heading back North for the Winter!  But this Sophomore kid described things that scared me worse than anything I had ever heard.  In High School, he was on the Fort Lauderdale Football team, but he was rather little,
around 140 pounds and so he was made a Defensive Back. But what he told me next was what truly terrified me.  <b>He was asking me if I thought it was &quot;right&quot; for the Fort Lauderdale High School Football Coach to have specifically taught him how to hit the star running backs on opposing teams on the side of their knee, in order to destroy the star running back's knee. He asked me whether that was right to do, just to win a football game!</b> To INTENTIONALLY (my emphasis) destroy some kid's life and career as a football player, just because a Coach decided to teach him how to end that kid's career.  Wow!  I was so angry at hearing that that I could hardly talk!  I thought about driving over to the Principal's Office of the High School the next morning and telling him about what I had been told.  But I realized that I was only a stranger, and HIS Football Coach was a CELEBRITY, and there was no chance that the Principal or anyone else would believe what I would say.  Worse, at that time, the
very idea of INTENDING to destroy an opponent's career in football would never have had any credibility (until recently with the New Orleans Saints Coaching Staff).  And the kid would have gotten in a LOT of trouble for &quot;trying to get the Coach in trouble&quot;.  So I did not go to the High School, and simply drove North the next morning.  Only NOW, twelve years later after the New Orleans Saints have gotten into trouble for intentionally destroying opponent's lives and football careers, do I realize that there may easily be an enormous problem.  <b>I guess I hope that some web-surfer might know how to find that kid who told me those scary things, who now should be around 28 years old.  Maybe he would feel safe from any vengeance from that Coach or that High School by now.</b>  But I wonder HOW MANY OTHER kids playing high school football are affected by Coaches who are so frighteningly aberrant?  Maybe the New Orleans Saints news might get even scarier incidents to the light of day. (2010)<br><br>

One day she told me that she had to leave for a few hours, and then she decided to tell me why.  She had a 6-year-old little girl living with us, but she told me that she needed to go to a Birthday Party for her son, who lived in an institution.  She mentioned that it was his 17th birthday.  She clearly saw that I was confused, regarding how a 29-year-old woman could have a 17-year-old son.  That evening, after she had returned, she saw that I was still very confused, so she explained things to me.  She told me that her father had been a significant home builder in LaPorte Indiana, and that when she was seven years old, he started &quot;using her&quot; (her phrase) to entertain himself and two of his (male) friends.  So, for the next five years, that horrible man USED his own daughter for sex entertainment
for himself and his friends, apparently nearly every day.  <b>AFTER ABOUT FOUR YEARS OF THIS ABUSE, she got pregnant when she was ELEVEN</b> (and she did not even know if the father was her own father or one of those other two men!)  She was so young that the baby, Alexander, was born with many birth defects, which was why he spent his entire life in an Institution.  Once she had told me these things, I was outraged and I wanted to contact the Police about her father's crimes.  She would not allow me to do that, as she felt her father was too important a businessperson in LaPorte that all that would happen would be that she would be humiliated.  I also had not calmly thought through enough to realize that the Statute of Limitations certainly expired for those three perverts.  So, as far as I know, none of them were ever punished in any way.  I wonder how common this is, as I have heard of similar arrangements in other families. A 12-year-old girl in Thornton, Illinois was regularly
abused by her step-father and several older brothers, for years. She eventually ran away from home and arranged to spend several days Testifying in a County Courthouse about her abuse. But no one seemed to believe &quot;a kid&quot; and none of the perverts were ever charged with anything. Of course, the fact that her mother stole many thousands of dollars from the car dealership she worked for in order to hire a very expensive Lawyer to defend them in that Court (from her own daughter) didn't help her to get Justice. <b>IT MUST BE STOPPED!</b> (2010)<br></p>

pressure (320 PSI) water deep in the Lake Powell Reservoir. <b>The sandstone
was and is washing away by erosion!</b> We both agreed that the Dam was
certain to come loose and fall over relatively soon, but he explained that
the Politics of the situation was that if he would even mention such
concerns, he would have immediately been fired and replaced. So no one will
or can do anything to keep an enormous catastrophe from happening, where
one of the world's tallest, 700-foot-tall concrete hydroelectric dam will
suddenly fall over and release about a trillion tons of water in the
180-mile-long Lake Powell Reservoir to roar downstream to kill everyone
then in the Grand Canyon. (2005)<br></p>

create new jobs but they never seem to actually do anything that helps.
<b>COMMUNITY WIND seems likely to provide an IMMEDIATE one million new
construction jobs in America </b>(in also providing a significant amount

around four million new jobs</b> (in the process of replacing highways,
railroads, cars, trucks, trains and airplanes with a far more efficient
method of moving people and objects around, at 200 mph speed and without
using any fossil fuels).  These two systems will be so economical as to
replace fossil-fuel-burning methods of today where the customer's cost
will be LESS than current costs, while also being so profit-producing
that they would be owned and operated by private corporations.
One result of this is that <b>NOT A DIME of government money would be
required (or wanted!) for either one of these important systems, or for
several other job-creating presentations in this Domain!</b><br>

Carbon Dioxide.  It is a big number, but note how rapidly OUR ACTIVITIES
of burning fossil fuels are causing the total to constantly rise!
 <a href="#1"><sup><b>details, footnote</b></sup></a><p>

    <b>THESE are TONS of gases, each comparable in size to entire large
    houses, ENORMOUS amounts!</b><p>

    It seems important here to mention a Chinese program that everyone seems
    to be bragging about (early 2012). They have installed many millions of
    dollars of equipment to try something they call Carbon Capture.
    In 18 months (a year and a half) they brag about having captured
    150 tons of carbon dioxide.  That might sound impressive and
    good, but stare at the changing number above to see what 150
    tons of carbon dioxide actually represents. They are not even close
    to having captured ONE-SECOND'S-WORTH of carbon dioxide in that
    year and a half of operation. I bring this up here to get the
    public to realize the SCALE of the problem that WE CREATE,
    every second of every day, by digging up and burning fossil
    fuels. Doing impressive demos for Reporters is easy for many processes,
    where a few pounds of carbon dioxide can be removed from air.  For
    maybe $30 cost, I could do a nice demonstration for you of
    the Solvay Process <a href="http://mb-soft.com/public3/disaster.html#18"><sup><b>footnote</b></sup></a>,
    a major industrial method which has been used for more than
    150 years which removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to produce
    soap, glass and other common products, where
    I could show removing several pounds of carbon dioxide in an
    hour or two.  <b>But a few pounds is not billions of tons,
    and no one seems to consider the problems of scaling up
    such experiments by factors of billions or trillions of times!</b><p>

    The burning of fossil fuels added around 15.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide
    to the atmosphere during the year 2008. <b>Actually, we are incredibly
    LUCKY!  The enormous amounts of fossil fuels we burn (coal,
    petroleum and natural gas) produced and released around TWICE this
    amount of increase</b> (31.9 billion tons during the year
    2008) <a href="http://mb-soft.com/public3/disaster.html#released"><sup><b>details</b></sup></a>.
    We just happen to be lucky that (cold) ocean water is extremely
    good at absorbing a lot of the carbon dioxide we are sending into the
    atmosphere! <a href="http://mb-soft.com/public3/disaster.html#2000"> <sup><b>footnote</b></sup></a> (these numbers are metric tonnes,
    and the same numbers in American short tons would be about 10%
    higher)<p>

    <b>SLIGHTLY warmer seawater is much worse about absorbing carbon dioxide,
    so as the oceans gradually warm up over coming years, that ability for
    the cold ocean water to absorb carbon dioxide will rapidly reduce.
    This will cause the effects of global warming to be occurring
    faster and faster in the near future.</b>  (There is also another
    downside to this process, as the absorbed carbon dioxide causes the
    ocean waters to become more acidic, with carbonic acid forming
    [H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub> makes H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>], which
    is a survival problem for ocean fish and plants and corals.)
    It is now known that WE are sending about 30,000,000 tons of
    carbon dioxide into the oceans EVERY DAY!  That is MASSIVE amounts
    of carbonic acid changing the oceans. <p>

    Also, see <b><a href="http://mb-soft.com/public3/disaster.html">Global Warming - The Physics of the Process</a></b>.

The real-time carbon dioxide calculator above has been in these web-pages
since early 2007.  It is EXTREMELY accurate (better than one-tenth
of one-percent precision, just check the
footnote to see the three simple and accurately known numbers which
get multiplied to derive it)!  In June 2009, massive news coverage
was made of a project where the giant German Bank <i>Deutsche Bank</i>
spent millions of dollars
to provide this same running-total of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
in Times Square in New York City.  The news reports announced
that several experts had spent a couple years doing the
calculations upon which their figure is based.  Well, the number
they show on that expensive display is WRONG!  And it took several
EXPERTS a couple years to multiply THREE SIMPLE NUMBERS TOGETHER???
YOU could multiply those three simple numbers: [(1) the
US MEASURED concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> at the South Pole, (2) the
Density of carbon dioxide, and (3) the total mass of the Earth's
atmosphere] in a couple minutes.  And still they got an answer that is around
20% wrong!  Maybe you could get a job at a German Bank!
The measured concentration of carbon dioxide keeps changing but the
other two numbers are fixed.
Our Footnote has an example of the actual calculation, which a Fifth Grader
should be able to do!  But we DO recognize that the great visibility of a
huge display of this number in Times Square, even if it is actually wrong,
can have great value.  But a German Bank spent millions of dollars to
hire &quot;experts&quot; to make significant math mistakes???  If I had any
accounts in that Bank, I might get a little nervous!<p>

<b>A quick note:  The public is sometimes incorrectly worried that the
increase in concentration of carbon dioxide itself might be dangerous. Nope!</b>
Inside your (closed) home in winter, you might have concentrations of 4,000
ppmv (parts per million by volume), ten times greater than the natural air
outside which is now around 401 ppmv.  (This is commonly measured in
northern homes in winter!)  In old auditoriums which have lousy
air circulation systems, a three-hour lecture or Sermon to thousands of
people can sometimes result in 10,000 ppmv (which all comes from all
those people breathing, exhaling carbon dioxide!), which can have the effect
to make many people a little drowsy! <a href="#31"><sup><b>the auditorium
numbers</b></sup></a>  And you wondered why that happened
to you!  And in submarines, up to 20,000 ppmv of carbon dioxide is
allowable! Carbon dioxide is actually a very safe chemical, and you
get it every day in carbonated beverages. The actual main danger is regarding
the established fact that the additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
represents a &quot;blanket effect&quot; to keep heat from escaping the earth.
No one actually realized this until about 1960, and we now know this
mostly from observing the planet Venus, where its atmosphere of
much more carbon dioxide has resulted in a surface temperature of
around +860&#176;F (+460&#176;C).  That shocked scientists when all the 1960s spacecraft
to Venus immediately melted! At that time, scientists had never been
able to measure temperatures there and they thought that all the thick
clouds would BLOCK the sun from getting through that thick atmosphere
down to the ground!  They expected the surface of Venus to be COLD at maybe
-40&#176;F (which is also -40&#176;C)!  The Earth will never have that much
carbon dioxide in our atmosphere, but significant heating is likely.<p>

Many Agronomists and Botanists believe that if the average Earth temperature
rises to just 80&#176;F [27&#176;C] (it is now around 59&#176;F [15&#176;C]),
that plants (crops) worldwide will no longer be
capable of lifting sufficient water from the soil to keep their
leaves from drying out and dying.  <b>If all the plants die, then there
will be no food for animals or humans.</b>  The fear is that this might
occur within one or two centuries.  There is a credible possibility
that we might have ALREADY set in motion a greater temperature
increase than that. Very scary.<p>

to get anything published unless a lot of other experts, a Peer Group, also considered them
to also be experts.  The Internet has changed this, where anyone
who has access to a computer can present himself or herself as a
knowledgeable person.  They often have no greater claim to being
an &quot;expert&quot; than their own opinion of themselves!  They rarely seem to have
the appropriate College Degree that might support such a claim, and they are
rarely considered to be an expert by the thousands of people who DO have
such College Degrees.  In any case, this then seems to inspire the
&quot;expert&quot; to make many ASSUMPTIONS which are not actually based on any
solid science or facts or logic, and to express their own PERSONAL OPINIONS
which they then present as being actual facts.<br><br>

The presentations in this Domain are rather different from that, in
generally being based on universally respected texts, such as the 
<i>Handbook of Chemistry and Physics</i> and <i>Mark's Standard 
Handbook for Mechanical Engineers</i>,
and the author of these pages received a Degree in Theoretical
Nuclear Physics from the University of Chicago.  You might therefore
notice some significant differences in the presentations
in this Domain.  These presentations tend to drive many visitors
crazy by extensive equations and mathematics that support statements
made in the text of a presentation.  These presentations also tend
to include a LOT of the logic and documentation for the statements
made.<br><br>

<b>We see this as extremely important</b>, to enable our visitors to recognize
the difference between the actual Scientific Method and what is commonly
claimed to be science.  Our hope is that some young people might choose
to pursue careers in science (or Technology) and we want to make sure
they can tell the difference, regarding having a productive and
successful career in a scientific field.<br><br>

Strict science is pretty amazing about how carefully it examines
facts and considers assumptions.  It is normal to ASSUME that gravity
is true, based on what science calls ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE.  All the billions
of people who have ever lived on Earth have apparently always dealt
with gravity!  As far as anyone knows, no one has ever seen gravity
to disappear!  But THAT is not good enough for strict science!
It is still referred to as a THEORY of gravity (or gravitation).
Science searches for PROOF and, so far, no one has yet found any
really compelling PROOF that it MUST exist.  Scientists generally
think that such proof will someday be MATHEMATICAL in basis.  Scientists
are not stupid and we all accept that gravity seems to be really
reliable, but it will not advance from a Theory to a Law until
more strict proof comes around!  This comment is important for a
thousand other reasons!  You have noticed that people ARGUE over
whether Global Warming is occurring.  People seem to think that
ASSUMPTIONS and OPINIONS matter, and the States of Virginia and
North Carolina have governments which are trying to pass laws
FORBIDDING Global Warming and even forbidding talking about it!
That is terrifyingly silly!  It makes me wonder how poorly educated
the lawmakers are in those States!  <b>A phenomenon is either true or it
is not, whether it is of natural cause or due to man-made activities.</b>
There are even HUNDREDS of people who have College Degrees in
science who are willing to claim whatever some company wants them
to say, for a few hundred thousand dollars!  Scientists are not
supposed to &quot;sell out&quot; science, but human nature is what it is.<br><br>

A comment seems necessary here!  Web-surfers are SOOO used to going
to sites which have FORUMS and DISCUSSION GROUPS that many criticize
me for not having such features in this Domain.  I don't mean this as
a criticism of visitors, but many of the subjects presented and
discussed in this Domain are REALLY technical!  I would fear that a
FORUM about many of the subjects might resemble the sort of conversation
which might occur in a Bar regarding Brain Surgery.  MANY people might
want to express their PERSONAL OPINION but how many people on those
barstools actually have the knowledge or expertise to truly intelligently
discuss Surgery Techniques on the Corpus Collosum?  My question is, just
how valuable or productive could such a barroom conversation be?  Now, as
this relates to the subjects in this Domain, YES, we ENTHUSIASTICALLY
ENCOURAGE visitors who KNOW how to solve Tensor Integral Calculus equations
to E-MAIL us with comments and criticisms and questions about related
subjects.  Ditto, we WELCOME Theologians to send in E-mails regarding
any of the Scholar-written articles on religious subjects in this Domain.
Actually, MANY of the IMPROVEMENTS of these 23,000 web-pages are either
suggested or inspired by such incoming e-mails!  There are also situations
where us &quot;eggheads&quot; have not understood how to DESCRIBE some technical
or complicated issue in ways that &quot;normal people&quot; might be able to follow,
and so when frustrated visitors have trouble following some obscure
point, it is USEFUL for us to get e-mails which tell us to &quot;chill out&quot;
and to &quot;use English&quot;.  Sometimes, that has been the only way for us to
realize that we need to &quot;simplify or clarify&quot; some concept.  We REALIZE
that we get millions of visitors from EVERY group of people, from some who
ARE on barstools and who want to discuss something on how an automotive
engine works, to others who ARE working on the consequences of Einstein's
General Theory of Relativity.  In an impossible task, we have tried to
make these presentations have some value to each of our visitors.<br><br>

In any case, ALL the presentations in this Domain are based on
the best science that is known.  Does science &quot;know every answer?&quot;
No.  But the entire point of all science is to always strive to learn
more, to better understand what, when, where, how and why of our world.
So, do we YET know every detail regarding Global Warming?  No.  Which is
actually why I spent several years in collecting all the scientific facts
and logic related to that subject, in <a href="http://mb-soft.com/public3/disaster.html">Global Warming - The Physics of the Process</a>.
But there are many of those people who are paid by giant Corporations,
and others who have terrible science skills, who also claim to tell
you truth, when they actually do not.  An interesting example that
seems to have gotten accepted by everyone these days is regarding the
(alleged) Global Warming effects of Methane gas (or buried methane
hydrate).  It would be interesting if such statements were true,
but the simplest examination of scientific facts shows that they
are absolutely untrue!  Yet those untrue claims get repeated nearly
every day by Reporters who do not know the science, and so everyone
believes it!  I have collected the science regarding that, specifically
the optical absorptivity of methane gas, in <a href="http://mb-soft.com/public3/disast02.html#methane">Methane characteristics</a>.  Either an atmospheric gas absorbs important
colors of heat radiation or it does not, and laboratory research
regarding that selective absorptivity identified such effects.
It is very puzzling that virtually all scientists and speakers
attribute such characteristics to Methane gas, where the actual
science is very obvious!  So the daily repeated claims that Methane
gas &quot;is twenty times worse a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide&quot;
appears to be absolutely complete fiction!<br><br>

I want to add a personal grumble here.  Fifty years ago, virtually no one
cared in the least about the negative impacts of human activities.  Rachel Carson's 
<i>Silent Spring (1962)</i> first began getting people's attention about many dozens
of the catastrophic things we do to our planet and its environment.
Interestingly, <b>I happened to be one of the FIRST scientists who gave
talks on the First Earth Day on April 22, 1970.</b>  As a First Year Science Teacher
at a very nearby Thornridge High School, I was recruited to be a Speaker
that day.  The First Earth Day was terribly unpublicized and unorganized!
When I got to Dolton Park that day, there was no one who seemed to be in
charge, and I wound up choosing a Picnic Table to climb up on to give my
High School Science lesson (twice!)<p>

Allegedly, we now know that we CANNOT be dumping all our sewage and garbage
into the oceans, as the oceans are not large enough to safely deal with it,
and fish and coral and whales and more die off by suffocating after getting caught
in our plastic garbage.  And, allegedly, we now know that we cannot
simply catch fish and animals with industrial methods without exterminating
many animals and plants.  Apparently, Americans now catch and kill
three times the entire weight of fish of all humans on Earth, every year.
So, at least we now seem to be aware of some of the bad things we do.
My grumble is that modern humans decide to collect billions of dollars
in order to finance really small scale demonstrations of some idea
someone came up with to allegedly solve some problem (which WE caused).
They form NGOs to do this, so they can get their $80 million personal annual
earnings as non-profit activities.  I am tempted to think that many of them
only initiate the alleged &quot;saving the world&quot; projects for the massive
free publicity they get and those huge personal non-taxable paychecks
they get. (I have the same grumble about many mega-Churches which seem
to exist for the exact same reasons.)
Every once in a while, an actual great idea is come up with.  <b>My grumble
is that 99% of these incredible expensive experimental projects, which are
bragged about, were not worth even trying.</b>  The Chinese project
and even the Solvay Process
mentioned above are examples.  The CONCEPT is fine, but it is just not
PRACTICAL, because of a needed scale factor of billions to actual be of value.
Another example is Tower Windmills, which is also a wonderful concept
but even crude math shows that even if they did not constantly break down,
no one could afford to build the millions of them that would be necessary
to actually really solve the problem.  I just want people to THINK THROUGH
whether such billion dollar ideas really have any valid possibility
of solving any problem.  Fuel-Cell powered Hydrogen electric vehicles.
Battery-powered electric cars. Nano-filter water purification systems.
Etc. Etc.<p>

An additional side note seems necessary here.  Modern society seems to only
see credibility in the comments of any scientist IF he has either
become a multi-millionaire due to aggressive self-promotion and
speeches OR if he has gone through the rather interesting process
of &quot;publish-or-perish&quot; in specific publications.  I have always been
a rather low-key person who avoids publicity and self-aggrandizement
and I also have only once been money-centered!  In 1973 I invented an
extremely advanced wood-burning stove for my own house, but word got
out and more than 27,000 people insisted on having one just like it.
I tried to find some local company which might be interested in
manufacturing them but no one was interested.  So I had to learn
a lot about &quot;business&quot; and I set up a unique factory where I manufactured
my JUCA woodstoves.  Even without actually knowing how to run a
company, and virtually  without ever advertising them, I manufactured
and sold over $11 million of my woodstoves.  My ex-wife loved that
prosperity, but I found it to consume my life.  In a later divorce,
a Judge gave nearly everything to her, which was fine.<br><br>

In any case, the University of Chicago taught me well in theoretical
Physics, and my life has included many unique ideas and inventions.
Once I knew the things I learned with JUCA, I felt that I COULD HAVE
refined about 30 of them into businesses which also would have again
made me a millionaire (IF that had any importance to me!)  When the
Internet arose and I learned of it, I decided to place rather complete
scientific presentations on many of them so that others might benefit from
things I had found and enjoyed, and all without trying to make a dime from
any of them!  So, in recent decades, the news media has not been flooded
with news of my ideas, and I have not again become rich, so leaders
now seem to assume that I am unimportant and to be ignored!  Fine,
but over the years, hundreds of millions of people have visited and
read one or more of my web-pages.  I am satisfied with that.<br><br>

I had also not competed in the impressively aggressive University
competition over getting Grants to finance research to support one's
career.  Each student or scientist NEEDS to constantly be Publishing
articles in specific periodicals to enhance their credibility toward
getting such Grants, and it is universally known that even Professors
who do not regularly Publish have careers that soon fade and disappear.
Since I was never into such &quot;competition&quot; and even hated the astounding
FORMAT focus of College Theses, I CHOSE to nearly universally avoid
even submitting Papers for such publication.  If my typewriter had
the &quot;wrong font text&quot; or I didn't structure paragraphs in some extremely
rigid format, my submissions tended to get rejected, even before anyone
actually READ any of them!  So I lost interest in that, since I did
not lust for the Grants that such efforts were all directed toward
anyway!<br><br>

The result of this is sort of amusing!  A number of these web-pages
presented in this Domain include extremely important information,
whether it is about generating electricity by unique and advanced methods
or heating or cooling houses and buildings or other useful things like
making sidewalks and driveways snow- and ice-free, or the Advanced
Physics presentations on the faulty Twins Paradox or the unique
research in Nuclear Structure.  The &quot;established leadership&quot; has
no interest in my pages!  Some day they will, maybe around the year
2030!<br><br>

So even though many of these pages have been available on the Internet
for many years, their advanced Technology and many benefits never seem
to show up in popular news media.  In a way, that is sort of disappointing.
During the past 15 years, at least 22,000 people have installed my
&quot;free, underground air conditioning&quot; in their homes, while hundreds
of millions of others still pay thousands of dollars to giant corporations
for electricity to run conventional A/C compressors.  It is such a simple
and OBVIOUS idea (which I invented in 1978 as part of my 100% Solar Heated
house) but still only a tiny fraction of people use it.  My guess is that
those few thousand people who no longer have to pay for expensive A/C
will tell neighbors and friends, and by 2030, most houses on Earth will
include using my approach to A/C.  I just find it all bemusing!<br><br>

The result is that some thousands of Automotive students have learned
about the Physics of Automotive Engines from my page on that, but millions
of Auto Mechanics have never learned that stuff!  The same in a variety
of other fields where Physics is important.  Since I never ask for any
money for any of these pages, there are also many people who assume that
the information MUST not have any value, else I would be trying to
&quot;get rich&quot; from selling it!  I find that sort of darkly sad.  Anyone
visiting ANY web-page does need to be cautious regarding believing
some of the outrageous statements that seem to be everywhere, but this
Domain has always had extremely strict ideas regarding ACCURACY and TRUTH
and LOGIC.  But few people seem to accept that!  Oh, well!  The millions
of visitors to my pages are at least entertained for a moment!<br><br>

<hr>

I just said that everything in this Domain is strictly based on brutal
logic and known scientific laws and knowledge.  This single little section
is an exception to those rules!  As a Theoretical Physicist, I want
to believe that all other Physicists are equally as careful and strict,
but there seem to be a few specific subjects where I have doubts
regarding them having been careful enough!  So here is MY list of
subjects (all of which arose within either Nuclear Physics or
Astro-Physics) where I want to present my IDEA of the ODDS that
each of these ideas is true and valid.  So this IS SPECULATION on
my part!  But I feel this is necessary such that quality Physicists
in the future might more carefully examine any or all of these subjects.<p>

Here is an interesting example subject. <b>Musical instruments such as the
acoustic guitar involve many aspects of Physics and resonance,</b> but most
features of lutes, mandolins, violins and guitars were developed prior to
modern scientific knowledge. The shape of the hollow body, its length, width
and depth, the size and shape and position of the sound hole, the length and
orientation of the fretboard and even the species of wood used and the lacquer
finish on it, were all simply incremental individual attempts to try to improve
previous instrument sounds and performance. In other words, very little actual
science was ever involved in the construction of such instruments. From a
Theoretical Physicist's perspective, this is all very fascinating, as we
KNOW all that stuff as basic Physics! Clearly, most
builders of violins found value in using well-seasoned spruce wood for the
soundboard, but they made the back usually of well-seasoned maple wood.
Lutes (from ancient times but mostly after about 1400 AD), tend to have
oval sound holes while acoustic guitars tend to have circular sound holes.
Mandolins have a pear-shaped body (which is asymmetric lengthwise), while
acoustic guitars have bodies that have a wider and narrower section with
a narrower still waist between them. Violins have f-holes for sound holes.
Mandolins tend to have very deep bodies, although the mandolins used
in American country music tend to be shallow and with relatively flat
backs.  It is not clear that very much actual logic or science has ever
been applied in the design or construction of any of these musical
instruments! They seem to have all been essentially trial and error efforts,
some of which sounded better and some of which sounded worse than previous
instruments! You may have noticed that some acoustic guitars are a LOT
larger than others. I personally came to be interested in the similarities
and differences of violins and fiddles. But the fact that acoustic guitar
bodies seem to have somewhat randomly different patterns regarding the
proportions of the dimensions of the different parts of their construction,
seems to imply a certain reliance on experimentation rather than actual
theoretical design.<br><br>

As a Physicist, I also find it fascinating that around 300 years ago,
Stradivarius created violins which are still considered the world's
finest, and even now, no one can identify how and why that is! One popular
GUESS is that Stradivarius changed the chemical composition of the
shellac he coated his instruments with. Virtually no one seems to
see any importance in the fact that he also slightly changed some of
the dimensions of his violins from what others have used.<br><br>

My interest in acoustic guitars is related to the apparent fact that each
was built as an experimental modification of previous instruments, where any
successful new instruments were then carefully copied. We refer to this
as APPLIED Physics, where an actual deep understanding of WHY something
caused an improvement or detriment is considered of minimal importance and
only the results (sounds) are actually important. In THEORETICAL Physics,
we are usually much more focused on WHY a slight change of some dimension
has some noticeable effect on the sound. The size and shape of each portion
of an acoustic guitar causes resonances and harmonics (along each of the
three dimensions). As a Theoretical Physicist, I would study whether the size
and shape of different parts of the resonant chamber might amplify resonant
frequencies which might enhance third-harmonics or fifth-harmonics to produce
sounds which were more harmonious. To simply build a guitar which had some
portion which was half an inch wider or narrower, without having any idea of
what that might create, seems rather foolish to me. A Theoretical Physicist
would do a LOT of calculations before actually drawing anything up.
Maybe it would seem important to try having the two halves of the
sound box to have widths that were in the proportion of 5 to 3, or
3 to 2, to inspire some desired harmonic in the sound, and also have the
waist width in some other resonant fraction dimension.
But no one seems to have ever used that approach!<br><br>

To me personally, I note that all
acoustic guitars have the rear portion being the widest, and since no one
seems to know WHY that is the case (which might simply be due to copying
previous designs or due to artistic appearance), I wonder about the sound of
an acoustic guitar which was &quot;reversed&quot; where the greater width part
might be near the fretboard, or even possibly a THREE lobed acoustic
guitar (with two waists)! And what about two sound holes???  Of different
sizes or shapes??? It seems clear to me that if the actual Theoretical
Physics behind these matters is not first learned and fully studied, it
might take construction of hundreds of three-lobed
guitars before one was (accidentally) found to have a better sound!<br><br>

These comments are intended to explain and justify the field of Theoretical
Physics! In the real-world, few people seem to care very much regarding
the theory and logic behind any existing technology, and a person might
TRY making a minimal change in an existing car engine or other device or
product to try to
improve performance. That is more of an Applied Technology or Applied
Physics approach, which tends to be limited to creating INCREMENTAL
improvements (such as in the Aeronautics and Aviation field, Automotive
fields and most others). Modern society tends to rely on such
incremental improvements. Theoretical Physicists tend to see such approaches
as being somewhat blind attempts to create advanced concepts and devices,
where we feel that a good understanding of the logic and facts might enable
an entirely NEW perspective regarding any subject. You may notice this
rather different approach in some of the presentations in this Domain.<br><br>

<b>Gambling?</b> Here is another Physics thing which HAS affected your life
but you never knew!  Any game that uses dice is probably sort of
&quot;crooked&quot; unless REALLY good dice are used!  Only Physicists
probably notice that the PITS where the pips (black dots) are made are RECESSED,
which means that some of the WEIGHT of the cube is missing there. Specifically,
there is a side which has ONE dot and the OPPOSITE side has SIX dots.  Do you
see yet?  The cube is NOT symmetrically balanced!  In fact, because the
side with the ONE is the heaviest side, that results in the opposite side,
the SIX being somewhat lighter and therefore coming up on top slightly
more often!  Nearly all dice are what I call cheap dice, and they have
this statistical flaw.  In Physics, it is possible to calculate the
Integral of the gravitational weight for a die which has rotated
sufficiently, and there IS a slight preference for SIX over ONE.  Not
a huge difference, but still statistically noticeable if you record
a thousand dice rolls (which, of course, I did when I was a teenager).
The fact that dice are often translucent makes it harder to insert a
chunk of more dense material without it being visible, but REALLY
good dice generally have that weight correction inside of each die.
REALLY good dice need to be designed and then balanced for both
Kinematic and Dynamic Balance, which is rather involved to do!
In theory, at Gambling Casinos, they only use the expensive kind of
dice, but I wonder whether all Casinos are willing to pay ten or twenty
times as much for Statically, Kinematically and Dynamically balanced
dice.  Somehow I suspect that many Casinos assume that no Guest would
know if they had &quot;crooked dice&quot; or not.  Mostly since virtually
no one but a Physicist would know either the problem or how it is
correctly handled in really good dice!  See?  YOU have certainly played
Monopoly or a hundred other games where your chance of winning or
losing was not as fair as you had assumed it was!<br><br>

For people who might believe or disbelieve any of the information
presented in this Domain, we encourage having the approach of a Theoretical
Physicist at all times, even without any ritzy education.  Check
ANY facts which strike you as questionable. Try to check
ALL assumptions made for the quality of logic involved. As a
Theoretical Physicist, I am a real fanatic about these matters.
The University of Chicago can claim most of the credit for that, by forcing
me as a Physics student to take an entire 13-week Graduate-School-level
Math Course which was to either confirm that 1 + 1 = 2 or that it is
not correct. Non-Physicists see this as a foolish waste of their
valuable time! But we Physicists do not want to take ANYTHING
for granted, and want to make sure of even things that seem as
obvious as 1 + 1 = 2. Farther down in this home page text is the
story of that Course, and why I now have great confidence in
1 + 1 being EXACTLY two! But I became far more alert to hundreds
of similar assumptions that everyone simply accepts without
question. It contributes toward a VERY cautious approach
to all fields of interest, and I encourage any and all readers
to be equally careful regarding whatever they read or see or
hear, even in this Domain.<p>

I have always been a forever curious person. Little kids are like that,
where they notice something that does not seem to make sense to them,
and they either ask questions of adults or otherwise try to sleuth it
out.  I guess I am just a very large kid!  As a recent example, I am
now fascinated with WHY we were born with a throat which is used for
BOTH eating and breathing. Your Pharynx is a short tube in your neck
which carries either food or air. Your body somehow knows how to cause food
to be sent down your esophagus to your stomach, while you also know how
to cause air to be instead sent to and from your trachea and your lungs. 
The moment you were born, you somehow KNEW 
how to open and close passages to be able to breathe into and out of 
your lungs! Ditto about KNOWING how to open and close passageways to 
be able to get food down into your stomach!  I cannot find any 
evidence that anyone knows WHY we are born like that! Virtually all
mammals are born the same way.  That seems to imply that there must be
some &quot;survival advantage&quot; but it is beyond me what that might be!
You certainly have occasionally accidentally caused a piece of food
or a sip of liquid to go down into your lungs, and you have choked
and coughed for a while to recover from that. After millions of
years of countless generations of us, I don't understand
why a few babies were not born with SEPARATE food and air paths,
where that seems to me to be a survival advantage. Obviously, I do not
understand why we are as we are!  I would love to learn the
answer to this puzzle!

<hr>

There is even more bad news than that in the link above!  (mid-2008)  This
has to do with the economy. <a href="#2"><sup><b>footnote2</b></sup></a><p>

<hr>

An initial observation seems appropriate here.  <b>It seems to me that
virtually everything that is sold or promoted or advertised today
is presented with intentional distortion, bias, spin and sometimes
even outright lies.</b>  People seem to really believe that companies are
willing to create million-dollar commercials and spend hundreds of
thousands of dollars every time they are aired, just so those companies
can GIVE people &quot;FREE&quot; carpeting, windows, clothing, millions of
dollars, etc.  And that those expensive commercials are run every hour to
offer diamonds that &quot;are worth double&quot; or SALES that offer enormous
(alleged) price reductions.<p>

<b>Doesn't ANYONE realize WHY they went into business in the first place?
TO MAKE THE GREATEST AMOUNTS OF MONEY THAT THEY CAN!</b>  For the
record, that IS the &quot;American dream!&quot;  Should we believe that
they are actually really stupid in spending millions of dollars just
to give even more dollars to us?  Duh?<p>

There seems to be a required suspension of all logic in accepting such
things!  Lots of insurance companies (and other companies that pretend to
be insurance companies!) tell you every day that you will receive
MILLIONS of dollars in coverage, while also telling you that you
will only have to pay $5 or $50 per month for it?  How come no one
seems to &quot;do the math&quot;?  Fifty dollars per month is $600
per year, right?  and in your 50 years of adulthood, isn't that a
$30,000 MAXIMUM that you will pay into it?  Ah, I see!  The company
is SO WONDERFUL that they are willing to make up for the rest of those
millions that you will allegedly eventually receive!  (Yes, I am aware that
interest rates and investments will increase your $30,000 paid in
by some amount, a GOOD increase if they are good at investing.  But
it AIN'T GONNA ever get to &quot;millions&quot; during your lifetime!
Yet, nearly everyone seems to simply accept such TV commercials as
absolutely trustworthy and reliable!  And those companies are
SO generous that they are willing to spend millions every day for the
air time to let you know about this amazing thing they want to do for you?<p>

A little more about the insurance commercials.  Even now, 2016, there are
HOURLY commercials running that promote this:  A (healthy) 43-year old man
allegedly pays $27/month for a $500,000 life insurance policy.  Seems to
me that the math is simple enough where even if he lived to 100, the most
he would (allegedly) ever pay in would be $27 * 12 * 57 years or $18,468.
And NOBODY sees anything fishy in that?  An Insurance Company that went into
business to make profits, and which certainly has Executives which are
paid big bucks, is willing to commit to paying YOU $500,000 in exchange for
$18,468 you ever pay them???  Worse, they are willing to pay millions to
have slick TV commercials created and then hundreds of thousands more every
day to pay for the air time to run them.  Obviously, they are trying to
convince me that they are SUCH AMAZING HUMAN BEINGS that they would do this
for ME, a total stranger!  The commercial goes further and describes an
even better deal for his (healthy) 37 year old wife, just $13/month for a
$350,000 policy.  As it happens, I am a fairly smart person, and if
someone offered me a TON OF GOLD for $50, I'd be tempted to wonder if it
were REAL gold.  Regarding the Insurance commercials, there ARE some really
tiny &quot;fine print&quot; lines that appear for an instant near the end of
the commercial, but even reading one word before they disappear is beyond me.<p>

As it happens, I got a PAPER FLIER from one of those Insurance companies.
It is not easy, but I can actually READ the fine print in it (with a
magnifying glass!)  The reality is not remotely like they promote.  It is
NOT a "life insurance" policy as it is only good for TEN YEAR TERM policies.  I imagine
that might be relatively safe for them regarding a healthy 43 year old
male.  <b>It also explains that the Premiums increase yearly.</b>  And NO ONE
can still get that insurance past age 75.  And the Insurance Company has
an impressive amount of freedom to raise premiums by their own practices
and rules.  <b>NOT REMOTELY LIKE what they try to get the
&quot;suckers&quot; to believe.</b><p>

And no one seems to think there is the slightest deception involved
in any of that!  Companies are going around just LOOKING FOR ME so that
they can give me FREE cars and piles of money and every other thing
that people dream of.  It is no wonder that ADVERTISING is such an
enormous business!  People BELIEVE nearly everything they are told!<p>

(Regarding the HEALTH insurance companies, there actually IS a partial explanation.
It is that they KNOW that 95% or 99% of the people who will pay in that
money will never have enormous claims during their lives!  Actually,
that probably includes YOU!  So if 100 people each pay in $30,000 in
premiums, that is three million dollars, which they invest and make extra
money but also are then able to pay the million dollar medical bills
for that rare person who amasses such bills.
But the insurance companies then make
enormous profits for their Executives and their investors, and also
pay out enormous medical claims for a VERY small number of people
who get AIDS or extreme cancers or other expensively-treated maladies.
As I compose this, the US government expects to FORCE insurance
companies to cover everyone and to disregard previously-existing
illnesses.  It is amazing that no one seems to realize that act
will entirely make their profitable game no longer interesting to
them that run those giant Corporations!  They will certainly move their
investments and efforts into fields where they can see enormous profits.)<p>

<b>It seems to me that virtually NO ONE seems willing to present any product or
service or person on WHAT IS ACTUALLY TRUE AND HONEST!</b>  Wow!  It is clear
that virtually EVERY company seems to spend massive time and effort in trying
to find ways to DECEIVE people into paying for their product or
service!  Even when they have good quality products!
(In vehicles, they somehow managed to overlook that Jeep
CJ5 TV commercial [around 30 years ago] where an eagle-eyed TV viewer
happened to notice that a rear wheel had LIFTED OFF THE GROUND in the
process of nearly having a rollover accident [IN A TV COMMERCIAL!],
and they still managed to get millions of people to buy SUVs, which
ALL have that danger as part of their basic design!)  And Ford and GM
had decided that they could get away with selling Pintos and Corvairs,
while knowing that those vehicles of theirs WOULD KILL PEOPLE.  They simply
set a dollar value on a human life and decided that they could afford
to settle claims regarding those deaths because they would have made
so much profit from those vehicles!  And nearly
every politician or other public person insists
on &quot;spinning&quot; to make themselves &quot;bigger than life!&quot;
I don't know whether we are supposed to conclude from all this
that that there are no products or services actually worth buying!
It sure seems to be an implication of everything we see.<p>

I realize that the reality is that every company is aware that
most every one of their competitors do this sort of thing, and they
realize that if they did not also do this stuff, they would not be
&quot;competitive&quot; regarding pursuing the billions of dollars
of profits that they all lust for.  And with only that concept in
their minds, it is sort of understandable that essentially every
modern company works hard to do as much deception that they feel
they can get away with.  THIS is what modern society has devolved into!<p>

Here is another example of massive deception, even though it is for
a basically good cause.  You have seen newscasts which note that
the people in Haiti and other countries earn &quot;less than two
dollars per day&quot; which is considered to be below survival
levels.  But I bet you have never related that to the (very expensive)
TV commercials that run constantly that show the faces of very sad
children to try to get you to send in money.  Some Accountant must
have calculated that people might not send in money if asked to
send in more than $19 per month, so that is what they ask you for.
THINK about this!  They even TELL YOU that this would cost you
LESS THAN A DOLLAR A DAY.  Then they list off the amazingly
prosperous life that this child would suddenly have due to your
dollar per day, including schools, food, safe water, clothes and more.
They claim that YOU would somehow provide this amazing prosperity for
that kid by giving your less than a dollar a day.  Doesn't this
strain credibility?  If TWO DOLLARS PER DAY is not considered enough
to ensure food and health, then how are YOU able to provide these
things and much more with far less money?<p>

Those organizations which run all those TV commercials NEVER release
any actual information regarding HOW MANY DONATIONS ARE SENT IN TO THEM
and HOW MANY CHILDREN ARE THEREBY HELPED.  There is so much deception in
what they do that it is disgusting (even though I WANT to help such
children, I will NOT do it through such organizations.  They neglect
to mention that around 3/4 of all the money you might send in has
to be spent in paying to make more TV commercials and then to air them
on thousands of TV stations and cable channels.  They neglect to mention
that the Executives of their organization are each paid millions of
dollars every year!  So the reality is that your 70 cents per day that
YOU send in barely ever gets to any needy children!  Around 55 cents of
it gets used up to pay those Executives and to make and air new
commercials to get OTHERS to send them money!  In my opinion, that whole
operation works a lot like an illegal Ponzi Scheme, where constant supplies
of NEW donors are required to keep their jobs and activities afloat!
I had realized much of this around 30 years ago, but I was shocked at
how extensive the deception was that they do!  There were THREE different
young women I then knew who EACH had the SAME PHOTOGRAPH of a very cute child
on their kitchen refrigerators, along with the EXACT SAME (alleged) letter
from that child.  However, the three supposed children were allegedly in
DIFFERENT African countries and allegedly had different names!  It also
struck me as amazing that a very young child who had never attended
any school [always emphasized in every commercial] had made a hand-written
note IN PERFECT ENGLISH, from each of those (alleged) three countries!)<p>

Again, if there was ANY honesty or truth in the TV commercials, it would
be fine.  But clearly at least FIFTY DONORS must have to be sending
in money every month (money that THEY often cannot really afford to be
giving) such that an adequate amount might arrive for ONE needy child.
But they KNOW that no one is going to be sending them $19 every month
IF they actually know that they are only one of fifty supporting that
child!  The disappointing part is that NO ONE KNOWS how many millions
of dollars gets sent in to such organizations every year, or whether
there is even one child who has materially been benefited in the
process.  Claiming to be a NON-PROFIT organization allows amazing
secrecy about such things, and so they have gotten away with that
rather massive deception for more than 30 years so far.  They  CAN'T
ever get into any legal trouble because no one can ever know what
they actually do or where the money goes!  Amazing!<p>

In a dark branch of this fact of modern society, I find it essentially
impossible to find even a CHURCH web-site which is not chock-full
of random advertising links.  It turns out that if the site is popular
regarding traffic, the Church can receive monthly checks larger than
what their Collection Plate provides!  That universal fact seems to
confirm that even Churches see FINANCIAL CASH FLOW as more important
that principles or morals or the Lessons they try to Teach!
(Our Church's web-site and also the BELIEVE Religious Information Source
web-site that it operates, gets around 50 million internet hits every year,
and promoters KNOW of our enormous 'traffic' and so we have been offered
many hundreds of 'monthly checks' if we would just add 'advertising links'
to our pages.  At one point, I discovered that our enormous traffic COULD
have our tiny Christian Church could be receiving over $300,000 every
month for including such links and display advertising.  That would have
been around $4 million in received cash every year, without even ever
having to do any work!  NO!  That is NOT our style!  Our (very popular)
internet Domain has NEVER had such display advertising, never has and
hopefully never will.)<p>

<b>In any case, THIS Domain has the intention and goal of actually
presenting FACTS, in HONEST WAYS, where NO DECEPTION hopefully
exists in any of the twenty-three thousand of our contained pages!</b>
Being human, I suppose that is probably not absolutely true, but it sure is
as true as I have been capable of trying to make them.<p>

This tends to result in a situation which many people may find
unexpected!  Nearly every presentation contains BOTH the wonderful
strengths of any specific concept or product, but it (hopefully)
also contains discussions of the negative shortcomings of those
same products or concepts.  The point is NEITHER to &quot;promote
or sell&quot; any particular view NOR to &quot;rip or denigrate&quot;
such things, but simply to try to present BOTH sides of important
areas which you may want or need to someday consider or analyze.
Hopefully, you will find &quot;about equal&quot; presentations
on both or all sides of any specific subject, all based on known facts
and on solid logic, such that YOU can
then determine any conclusions that YOU think are most valid.<p>

For example, where virtually any other information source regarding
tower windmills presents &quot;immensely optimistic&quot; comments or claims,
toward &quot;selling&quot; that concept or some specific product, the
presentations in this Domain should (hopefully) present HONEST
and REALISTIC views of what might be achieved with such a system.
<b>Yes, there IS good reason to examine wind power as a possible
source of the energy upon which our societies rely.</b>  But it needs
to be honest and balanced information for anyone to be able to actually
make an informed decision!  There is currently IMMENSE deception to the
public regarding the actual performance of the giant windmills and wind farms!
It would be GREAT if they could actually do what the public is led to
assume.  But the fact that there tends to be a ten-year lead time
between contractors being paid to build such things and their eventual
daily operation, so the money will be long gone before the public ever
fully realizes that nearly all of those tower windmills and wind farms
will certainly supply only maybe 1/10 of what is now expected of them.
You might want to read <b><a href="http://mb-soft.com/public/wind7.html">Wind-Powered Electricity for 1000 Homes</a></b>, regarding Practical Large-Scale Wind-Generated Electricity
for the facts, the logic and the whole story.<p>

Long ago, around 1975, I was amazed that Feature Stories in magazines
would be titled &quot;We heat our entire home with a Ben Franklin
Stove.&quot;  Technically, that was true, but it was immensely misleading.
The story would describe how the family would have to wake up every
two or three hours all night to load more wood in their stove, and
then still have to wake up to a 53&#176;F house in the morning, and that the
house was extremely small, just four small rooms,
around 600 square feet.  THOSE occupants considered it acceptable to
wake up to a 53&#176;F house!  <b>I wouldn't!</b>  And the living room I am now
sitting in while composing this text is around half the size of that entire
house!  Maybe I am too spoiled, but I
expect to wake up to a house that is around 71&#176;F or 72&#176;F!  (At the
time of reading such very popular stories in 1975, I had already been fully
heating an 11-room, three-story, uninsulated 1896 farmhouse, for the previous
three winters, with a very unusual woodstove that I had
Designed, Engineered and built for myself, and I would NEVER tolerate having
to wake up in the middle of the night just to add more wood!  I would also
never have been happy to wake up to a house that was not cozy warm at 70&#176;F
in the morning.  I am <b>NOT</b> a &quot;morning person!&quot;)
In any case, technically, it was not a lie that that family in the magazine
story said that they were heating their whole house with a woodstove.
But millions of people were later very disappointed to buy such
Franklin stoves and then find that it did a fine job of heating ONE
room and possibly two, but never much more unless they lived in Florida!
Info on my JUCA woodburners, and woodburning in general, is at
<b><a href="http://mb-soft.com/juca/index.html">Woodburning Furnace - JUCA</a></b>.
Fireplace, Woodstove - JUCA Super-Fireplaces. As to how it works
so well, <b><a href="http://mb-soft.com/juca/info/works.html">How a JUCA Woodburning Furnace Works</a></b>.<p>

So I suppose that I have a grudge against most modern advertising,
because I keep looking for SOME commercial that does not wildly exaggerate
actual abilities of some product and that does not intentionally
deceive viewers/readers into arriving at wrong conclusions.  If it were
up to me, when ads said FREE, if those very expensive commercials
were not ACTUALLY giving away the things they claimed, I would
want to see them all sued!  Maybe some level of truth in advertising
might then re-appear!  In any case, THIS Domain makes a serious effort
at avoiding such things, and tries to present honest facts and
reliable logic, and even tries to AVOID letting readers accidentally
arrive at some wrong conclusions.  However, it probably will be
a LOT more boring than the exciting commercials that tell you that
you have already won a million dollars or will win a Hummer or that the
promoter is going to GIVE you gold or money or gasoline or whatever!<p>

OK.  I DO have some strange attitudes about some aspects of modern
society.  Several years ago, I was disgusted and astounded to see
a TV news segment that described that 200 sports coaches in the
State of Washington had been arrested and convicted IN THAT YEAR of molesting
the young children who trusted them and whose parents also trusted
them.  My mathematical mind quickly realized that if there were 200
in just Washington State, and the US has roughly 50 times the population
of Washington, that must have meant that there had been TEN THOUSAND
sports coaches in the US that were arrested and convicted IN THAT
YEAR.  And it's hard to even imagine how many thousands of others
have gotten away with their aberrant behaviors!<p>

So, MY &quot;strange attitude&quot; regarding such aberrant people?  Put
them in Prison for a year or two and then release them to do their horrible
things again?  <b>NO!</b>  No one could actually get away with doing this,
but just imagine if ONE such convicted pervert was taken into a &quot;Public
Square&quot; (maybe on a small stage in Times Square or a similar location)
stripped and then <b>an accurate machete swing was used to perform a
&quot;rapid public operation&quot;,</b> probably with a lot of Reporters and
TV cameras present to record the gross and gruesome event.  Yes, it would be
cruel punishment for someone with a machete to &quot;chop off the offending
parts&quot; in a fraction of a second.  And, yes, a medical doctor would need
to be present to stop the bleeding that would certainly occur.<p>

BUT JUST IMAGINE THE CHANGE OF BEHAVIOR OF THOSE THOUSANDS OF <b>OTHER</b>
ABERRANT SPORTS COACHES and the millions of others who abuse children.  They
would certainly all watch it as a video, watched millions of times on
You-Tube and FaceBook and elsewhere.  <b>The SINGLE example of such a
public spectacle, would certainly cause a shiver up the spine of such
perverts, and a SINGLE SCENE could likely ensure the
safety of MILLIONS of children, couldn't it?</b><p>

(I admit that I got this idea from the sick terrorists who have beheaded
people and videotaped it.  But I truly believe that if a SINGLE such
&quot;public machete operation&quot; was performed and videotaped, millions
of men would see that gruesome video on You-tube or whatever, and I think,
would DECIDE to never do things to little kids!  Would that be worth the
severe bending of the Constitution once?  Well, I'm not a Lawyer or a Supreme
Court Justice, so I do not know.  But I really suspect that an
&quot;outside-the-box&quot; response like that, JUST ONCE, would
certainly make MILLIONS of little kids far safer.)<p>

As to having an effect on that one man, obviously it would, but that
would not be the point.  The intention would be that such a bizarre scene
would never have to be re-enacted.  The VIDEO of it being seen over and over
by millions of men who might consider doing bad things to little kids,
should scare the daylights out of them.  The thought that the one part of
their body that seems to drive them most, might get viciously chopped off!<p>

Of course, in America, aberrant people all KNOW that such a thing
could never happen to them.  Even if they get caught doing the most
horrendous things to little kids, they get good food and a roof for a
year or two while in prison, and then they know they will be
released to do it all again, to OTHER unsuspecting little kids.
SEE why my &quot;strange attitude&quot; seems to make some sense!
But since that will never happen, there will be MILLIONS of children
who will be abused in every conceivable way, some of which will occur
on the very block on which you live!<p>

I wonder if there might some day be ONE Convicted child molester who actually
regretted his behavior and who might VOLUNTEER to be the participant
in such a gruesome scene???  A Judge might even grant a Prison Release to
such a convict that agreed to be the object of such a scene.  After all,
that man would never sexually molest anyone else again!  With a signed
document that said that he knew what he was agreeing to!  In such a case,
maybe the Constitution might not need to get &quot;bent&quot; while still achieving the
desired goal of safety for millions of kids???

Down to more calm subjects now!<p>

This Domain contains presentations on many specific subjects in
science and Engineering.  Many visitors seem to think that I just
dreamed up the different things.  No, a Physicist does not approach
any subject that way.  And, instead of &quot;searching for many books
or web-sites for information to be used for such presentations&quot;, that is
also not how a Physicist should work.  In fact, the bulk of the science
and the Engineering and math in the included web-pages in this Domain
were based on a total of TWO primary source texts!  One is the <i>Handbook
of Chemistry and Physics</i>.  The other is <i>Mark's Standard Handbook
of Mechanical Engineering</i>.  Those two resources include the
data and the equations behind nearly all of Physics and Mechanical
Engineering.  That information was APPLIED in unique new ways, true.
But the point is that virtually all of the presentations in this
Domain are actually rather mundane applications of universally
accepted knowledge of Physics and Mechanical Engineering.<p>

My College Degree was in Nuclear Physics from the University of Chicago.
They seem to have done some useful things inside my head!
However, the logical and critical thinking that they taught me
seems to have no limits!  Even within modern Physics, I see assorted
things which appear to be enormous errors, nearly always because someone
had made UNJUSTIFIED ASSUMPTIONS in (allegedly) solving some previous
issue!  MUCH of modern Physics is wonderful and very well based
in facts and logic, but there seem to be really bad exceptions!<p>

I find it somewhat humorous that virtually all Physicists look down their
noses at people who even mention things like ghosts or ESP or UFOs, or
anyone who claims to be a Christian, immediately saying that the other
person is ignorant in believing things that are not supported by
scientific evidence.  Well, there are millions of people who have
claimed to witness ghosts, or have experienced ESP, and nearly as
strong a factual basis for the other two subjects above.  But the
same Physicists who humiliate people for saying such things, make
even MORE un-factual and un-based statements, and consider them
to be rock solid!  Funny!  Modern Physics has DOZENS of subjects which are
each results of various people's wild imagination, where there is
NO ACTUAL BASIS WHATEVER!<p>

Over the years, I have become involved in a number of projects, each
of which has been intended to somehow benefit society, Nature or God.
Some presently exist, some are in development, and some are just available
for possible combined efforts!
<b>ALL are protected by U.S. Copyright protection!</b>
The presentations included in the subject lists below give at least an
overview of many of these projects.  Each is designed to be <b>PRINTABLE</b>.
(But you may want to first select the WHITE PLAIN BACKGROUND (W) and an
attractive FONT before printing any of them out.)
They apply to a wide variety of fields.  Some represent possible
business ventures (some of which already exist).  Most represent
new combinations of perspectives or technologies that seem to
enable new insights into the subject at hand.  I hope that these
scientific, social, religious, and intellectual pages might
provide seeds of thought on which others could build.  If such use
is made of any of my pages, I request a notation of credit be included.<p>

The product- or service-related business concepts presented all belong to
me, and I have Patented or have Patent procedures in progress for some
of them.  Nearly all of these are also meant to somehow benefit society.
Use or development or marketing of any of them would ONLY be allowed
based on a written contract of agreement regarding that particular
invention or device or process.  NO authority is given to manufacture
or promote any of them, based on the mere presence of these presentation
pages.<p>

It seems important to try to address the major difference between how
a good Physicist looks at the world and how everyone else usually
does!  Physicists are usually seen as very peculiar, in a negative sense,
of not having touch with the real world.  I can't speak for other
Physicists, but I think I have at least a vague idea of
&quot;real life&quot;  In fact, I am often amazed that the general
public often seems to have so little idea of what is actually going on
regarding many subjects!  Several examples seem appropriate here, to try to
indicate the differences of the viewpoints.  I have provided footnotes for
each which contain the logic and the data that seems to support the one
view.  I have absolutely NO idea what supports the OPPOSING view!<p>

<h2>Weight-Loss and Obesity</h2>

<b>There are THOUSANDS of weight-loss programs constantly advertised,
each trying to get you to send them money for some magical results
they always (nearly) promise.</b>  And people BELIEVE them!  Don't people see
that even Oprah has failed to find any successful system, after
countless attempts?  Doesn't anyone see any problem there regarding
credibility?  Well, I see the problem as being that NO consumer of such
programs or products seems to have a Physicist's super-logical viewpoint!
So they actually think they are being told the truth, and they assume
that the concepts argued are valid!  <b>In contrast, consider (this)
Physicist's view:</b>  One pound of bodyfat in the body (actually
called lipids or triglycerides) is made up nearly completely of carbon,
hydrogen and oxygen, about 77% of it being carbon atoms.
<a href="http://mb-soft.com/public3/weight.html#1"><sup><b>footnote</b></sup></a> 
<b>Say you decide to somehow remove exactly one pound of
bodyfat from your body (without surgery!).  That actually means that you
have to find some way to discard about 0.77 pound of carbon.</b>  This is
not quite as easy as it might first seem.  We know the body breaks lipids
down into simpler molecules (like by the Krebs Cycle) to get the energy
out of it.  We know the body can get rid of hydrogen and oxygen VERY
easily as water and in many ways, by sweating, by moisture in the breath, by
urination, etc.  No problem there.  <b>But how many ways does a human
body have of getting rid of carbon?</b>  Do you know?  No one seems to!
The answer is essentially ONE!  It must convert the carbon into
carbon dioxide (by oxidation, in a process called Metabolism) and then exhale
it as a maximum of 4.4% of your outgoing breath. (Dalton's Law of partial
pressures) <a href="#10"><sup><b>footnote</b></sup></a>  THAT'S IT!  It has
NO other significant way of dumping carbon!  The point
being, in order to get rid of that one pound of bodyfat, the body has
NO alternative except to have to EXHALE enough breaths in order to
get rid of enough carbon dioxide that can contain that 0.77 pound of carbon!
(Of course, this is PLUS the carbon that must get dumped due to the body's
normal daily Metabolism.)  I suppose that you mathematical sorts may have
already figured out that the 1.0 pound of bodyfat or the 0.77 pound of carbon
would require about 26,400 normal breaths, to get rid of all that
carbon!  A LOT!  The Physics logic
seems crystal clear to me, but no one else seems to realize
these unavoidable facts.  (Physics could not really see all this in any
other way!)<p>

It is even easy to confirm this is all true.  An average adult man eats
(ballpark) around 2,200 Calories of food each day, and breathes about a total
of (ballpark) 17,000 times each day.  Each average breath is about half
a liter of air, which, when exhaled at body temperature, can each contain a
maximum of about 22 milliliters of carbon dioxide in it, which is about
0.0405 gram of carbon dioxide per average breath.  This includes 0.0110
gram of carbon atoms in it.  In those 17,000 exhales each day, just
multiply to find that means a total of 681 grams of carbon dioxide or
<b>189 grams of elemental carbon can leave the body each day by way of
exhaled breath.</b> (Still following?)  The <b>2,200 Calorie daily diet
included about 0.40 pound or 189 grams of carbon in the food.  That amount
of carbon is processed throughout the body in the daily Metabolism</b>.  We
can therefore see that the NORMAL exhaled breath accounts for the same amount
quantity of carbon that had entered the body during eating and digestion, and
we even now see WHY the body weight is therefore generally stable!<p>

<b>By the way, virtually no one, including alleged experts, seems
to know this fact!</b> I created that web-page in October 2009
<b>http://mb-soft.com./public3/weight.html</b>  During 2014, the British
Medical Journal and ABC-News-Catalyst totally neglected my 2009 Research
work and they claimed that a man with a questionable education duplicated
some of my work in 2014.  In the scientific community, THAT is not
supposed to be allowed!  In any case, 24,000 people had read my 2009
article, BEFORE that guy ever came up with a partial idea, and before
he forgot to consider that human beings actually have to EAT to survive!<p>

Nearly everyone seems to assume that the food that we eat and
digest passes through the body to be excreted.  It obviously has to go
SOMEWHERE, due to the scientific Law of Conservation of Mass!  But the
reality is that essentially ALL the food that you actually digest
eventually leaves your body in your exhaled breaths!  NOT in the
nastier way that people assume!<p>

You can probably see that if ANY of the variables regarding digestion
OR BREATHING are changed, the body weight will likely then also change.
Greater Calorie intake (without any increase in Metabolism or breathing
rate) pretty much obviously means
an increase in body weight.  Greater Metabolism and heavier breathing,
as, for example, due to a lot of exercise (without any increase
in the Calorie intake) and the body weight is nearly certain to decrease.
Pretty obvious, isn't it?  Probably too many numbers, sorry, but I
wanted to build an air-tight case regarding this stuff.<p>

<b>I hope you see that no assumptions were made in the discussion here (or
in the 2009 Article), and simple and standard scientific knowledge and logic
is all that has been used.</b>  This line of analysis forces accepting an
entirely new (and somewhat bizarre!) set of conclusions!  Yes,
whether a person is obese or skinny IS related to their rate of
Metabolism, but for an unexpected reason, apparently regarding their rate
of breathing!  A skinny person loses heat more easily from the skin,
for having less thermal insulation, and so that person MUST have
somewhat faster Metabolism and faster or deeper breathing.  The converse
is true for obese people, who seem very likely to breathe either more
slowly or more shallowly, as a result of this effect.<p>

Exercise CAN certainly contribute toward weight loss, but IF the
associated breathing is not sufficient, the body could not actually
get rid of the carbon atoms!  Isn't that really weird?
<b>The consequence is that EXERCISE can get rid of bodyfat ONLY by
doing TWO things: increasing the Metabolic usage of energy stores (everybody
has long known that) AND INCREASING the breathing rate and depth.</b>
EITHER ONE ALONE could not do it!  It really does not seem to matter
whether you can lift 700 pounds or not!  It may not even matter whether
you are fit or not, as long as you do some activity that causes your
Metabolism to speed up AND causes you to breathe either deeper or faster or
both!  The faster metabolism part is also the actual reason why things like
Cocaine and Speeders (Amphetamines) tend to cause people to become skinny,
by doing BOTH of those effects, (although such people often also
forget to eat!)<p>

There is another confirmation of this stuff.  When Researchers
do Metabolism Studies on people, what they actual monitor is the
carbon dioxide exhaled in the breath!  They make an ASSUMPTION
that the instantaneous Metabolic Rate is necessarily proportional to the
Respiration Rate, which is actually an extremely solid assumption, as it is
necessary for bodily equilibrium.  <b>But the fact that we have
identified TWO INDEPENDENT PROCESSES here</b> seems extremely
important.  <b>If EITHER the Metabolic Rate or the Respiration Rate
was somehow restricted, the other would necessarily have to also
be restricted by the brain, in order to maintain bodily equilibrium.</b><p>

I suspect that there is an easy Thesis for a Medical student here!
Obtain Physical Exam data for at least 1500 people who have deviated
septums (obstructed nose passageways) and that for 1500 others who do
not.  Do a Scientific Statistical Analysis of the BMI number (a
crude system of describing fitness by the metric body weight divided
by the metric height squared), and it seems certain that the people with
obstructed nasal passageways should be statistically heavier!  BECAUSE
if less airflow can normally occur, then the brain would necessarily
restrict Basal Metabolism in order to maintain chemical
equilibrium of the body.  If Respiration Data is also available, then
even better Statistical Analysis could be done.<p>

When a person is obese, it might therefore be because of EITHER
a Metabolic Rate that was too low for the food intake (with the
respiration rate automatically then being reduced by the brain) OR due to
a Respiration Rate that was too low to carry the carbon out of the
body (with the brain then automatically reducing the Metabolic Rate
in response).<p>

The implications of this seem staggering!  <b>Say that your Metabolism
was fine and that your particular body simply had developed a habit
of breathing 10% more shallowly or 10% less often than most people do.
Maybe that is due to aging or a change to a sedentary lifestyle.
No one would ever notice this minimal difference.  But say that you then
could somehow LEARN (again) to breathe just 10% more deeply, with 0.50 liter
of air in an average breath rather than your normal 0.45 liter.</b>  You might
have already learned to restrict your food intake to eating 1,980 Calories
of food each day, which might keep you from gaining even more weight, but
you could not seem to lose any of the weight you have.  But now your body
would be able to exhale 10% additional carbon dioxide (equivalent to 2,200
Calories per day).  (Remember that you had already learned a pattern of only
eating 1,980 Calories each day.)  <b>Simple calculations indicate that this
simple and easy change could represent a WEIGHT LOSS (of actual bodyfat)
of around 0.4 pound per week or 22 POUNDS per
year!</b>.  It sort of boggles the mind to think that all those expensive
weight-loss programs might not be necessary at all, and that many of them
are apparently impossible to be effective!  And that a person might be able
to lose really large amounts of actual bodyfat simply by learning a
pattern of breathing a little more deeply (or a little faster)!<p>

A web-page describes the details and the math and science behind this at
<b><a href="http://mb-soft.com/public3/weight.html">Bodyfat, Weight Loss, the Physics of Body Weight Control</a></b>.<p>

There IS a caveat included above!  Those larger breaths ARE ABLE TO
carry away 10% more carbon.  Will it actually do that?  Don't yet
know!  It could happen that if your body has gotten really used
to a slowed Metabolism, it might already  therefore only be supplying a
smaller amount of carbon to the lungs.  The CONCENTRATION of carbon
dioxide might simply drop lower to carry away the usual amount.
So it might not be that your Metabolic Rate would increase just
because the limitation of the Respiration Rate was lifted from it.
<b>Your brain has to figure this out!</b>
Once you have taught your body to breathe slightly more, it MAY then
be necessary to also teach your body Metabolic Rate to also increase
that small amount.  Whether it would do it &quot;because it could&quot;
or only after it was re-taught, is not yet known.
So it DOES seem important to consider exercise, which would have the
effect of teaching your body to increase both.<p>

The footnote also includes some other interesting possible implications.<p>

I recognize that as a Physicist, I am NOT an expert regarding
dietary regimens and such, but the above logic is simply LOGIC!<p>

<h2>Alternative Energy Devices and Systems</h2>

In &quot;alternative energy&quot;, there are countless
examples of where inventors or manufacturers claim unbelievable
things!  The fact that neither they nor the public seems aware
of the Conservation of Energy, seems to encourage that sort
of thing!  They actually find ways to keep from being sued
by such extravagant claims by describing what is called
PEAK POWER RATINGS, instead of any PRACTICAL POWER RATINGS!<p>

I use an analogy of people buying cars that are advertised as
having 495 horsepower engines.  THAT is a PEAK POWER RATING, describing
the GREATEST POSSIBLE POWER PRODUCTION of that engine.  It is an
irrelevant number, except for a couple seconds at a traffic light!
Cars are also described as having a certain fuel efficiency, a number
of MPG, which is a far more useful number to know!  That same high-powered
car actually only produces around 40 horsepower in order to travel
at constant speed on an Interstate Highway, where it then gets maybe
25 MPG fuel efficiency.  THIS is a way of presenting PRACTICAL POWER RATINGS.
The two are EXTREMELY different.<p>  

In nearly all forms of alternative energy products, there is commonly
a factor of about ten to one of PEAK power to AVERAGE power.
ADVERTISING always presents PEAK power ratings, which are impressive!
But they are immensely misleading regarding AVERAGE performance which
a buyer might actually expect to get!<p>

So battery-powered vehicles always claim amazing performance
while also claiming incredible GREENness and also that a standard
extension cord can carry enough electricity to recharge it. 
<a href="#11"><sup><b>footnote</b></sup></a><p>

In Hydrogen, the claims are even more outrageous, probably because even
fewer people are capable of determining whether they are right or not.
(Use the same footnote as above!)<p>

In PV, photovoltaics, ditto, where customers are led to believe that
they will be generating enormous amounts of electricity for their
family to live a normal life. <a href="#12"><sup><b>footnote</b></sup></a><p>

The footnotes show that with the simplest of examination, of figuring out
how much (PEAK) power (energy flux) is being claimed and also figuring out
how much (AVERAGE) power is actually likely available from the claimed
source, MANY such claims are immediately seen as wild speculation
(or outright lies).<p>

The presentations in this Domain virtually always describe AVERAGE
performance, what can be EXPECTED by an actual buyer of such products.
There are also clear references to PEAK POWER RATINGS when the very
inflated promotional claims are discussed.<p>

<h2>Astrophysicists and Nuclear Physicists</h2>

This kind of questionable thinking even occurs WITHIN the Physics
community!  Physicists come up with the silliest and wildest speculation,
and then aggressively claim it to be true, and NO ONE seems to ever even
do any analysis to see if the claims were credible or even possible!
There are many of these, and modern Physics seems to be chock full
of &quot;theories&quot; which are absolutely devoid of any data
documentation or support, and usually the author never even PRESENTED
any valid logical case!  It didn't use to be like that in Physics!
In the old days, you had to provide immaculate logic, mathematics and
empirical data to support even the tiniest point.  Here is one specific
example that amuses me!  A few years back, researchers were grumbling
about the fact that they had no direct access to rocks or other materials
from Mars, in pursuit of trying to find whether there was ever water
there, and possibly even ancient life.  So, an unbelievably silly idea
was presented, and it quickly became absolutely accepted by the Physics
community.  The premise was that tiny rocks, actually meteorites, found buried
in the ice of Antarctica, were (allegedly) all materials that had come from Mars!
They claim that either volcanoes on Mars, or incoming meteorites there,
caused such explosive blasts that what is called ejecta was launched
upward.  They go farther and claim that the impact or the volcano was
so powerful that the ejecta was launched at greater than escape velocity
from Mars, so that the chunks of material were sent into outer space.
And finally they claim that those many particles all hit the Earth
in Antarctica and they are therefore SAMPLES of Mars that we can study.
There have been many Papers published which claim to describe Mars
based on study of those small Antarctica meteorites.<p>

I guess in a common sense way, this could sound possible.  But they
used so MANY speculative assumptions in their story!  ANY actual
examination of the logic and the numbers shows that to be a truly
silly claim!  Do they really believe that millions of tons of the
Earth were launched out into space when the (alleged) huge meteorite
ended the dinosaur's reign?  I doubt it, and on Earth, such
impacts are far more explosive because of all the water that is
around that can boil and create pressure.  But even go wild and say that a
MILLION TONS of material from the Earth had gotten launched out into
space back then.  How much of that material would have hit Mars to land
there?  Well, this is a very simple problem regarding Spherical Geometry.
First, consider the Moon, which is very close to us.  We can easily
calculate that the Moon takes up about five one-millionths of our whole
sky.  If material had gotten launched out from Earth in random directions,
roughly 0.000005 of it should have hit the (entire area of the) Moon.  Not that
complicated! If a million tons had gotten launched (an astonishingly large estimate!)
only about five tons of it would have likely hit the ENTIRE surface of the
Moon.  At its AVERAGE distance from us, the angular size of Mars takes
up about 1/200,000 the angular area of the Moon, also very easy to
calculate.  So how much of the million tons (allegedly) ejected from
Earth would have hit the ENTIRE surface of the planet Mars?  Well,
that fraction of the five tons, or a TOTAL of LESS THAN ONE-EIGHTH OUNCE of
such material spread over the ENTIRE surface of Mars!  In the other direction,
if Mars had ejected such an enormous amount, a million tons of ejecta,
at some point in the past, the situation would have been essentially
the same, where less than ONE-FOURTH OF AN OUNCE could possibly have hit
the ENTIRE area of Antarctica (smaller than the area of Mars), certainly
TOTALLING a size no larger a single kernel of corn!  (Keep in mind that
THIS would have only been possible if Mars had somehow ejected a MILLION TONS
of material!)
Such very small particles of material tend to burn up as they enter our
atmosphere (as meteors) and only much larger ones usually make it through
the atmosphere to land.  Yet, those (alleged!) Physicists claim to have
found large numbers of such debris in just a very small area of Antarctica.
Should DUHH be appropriate?  The SIMPLEST of math problems, which you just
followed, shows how ridiculous that whole idea is!<p>

It is sad to note that, at the time this amazing claim was made,
there were some scientists who wanted to try to convince NASA to give
them more money for spacecraft to Mars.  Science had NOTHING to do with
those alleged &quot;discoveries in Antarctica&quot;.  It was all just politics!<p>

Also, they didn't bother to even try to determine
WHETHER material could actually be given escape
velocity speed to escape Mars in the first place.  That problem is somewhat
more complicated, but it easily shows that there was NO chance that any
massive amount of material was ejected, (just like as is true on
Earth when violent volcanic explosions occur) unless the entire planet of
Mars was on the verge of being blown apart into two pieces!  And even then,
not much of it would have ever gone all the millions of miles to softly
land on Antarctica!<p>

There is nothing wrong with SPECULATING about such ideas.  Creativity
is a good thing!  But Physicists are SUPPOSED to immediately do
some math and logic analysis to see if what they want to claim is
even possible.  In this case, it is NOT REMOTELY POSSIBLE, by proof
provided by very basic Laws of Science.  The really troubling thing
is that the entire Physics community endorsed and adopted this
insane concept and it is now considered as virtually a certainty!
Didn't ANYONE do those simple math exercises we just looked at?<p>

(This HAS been realized as a foolish failure and corrected in the past
few years since we have landed several robotic landers that have
analyzed the soil of Mars. Those robots have now found chemical
compositions of Mars which are absolutely different from the small
chunks of (probably normal meteorite) material that were found
in Antarctica.  In fact, once the chemical analysis of those chunks were
finally done [which had NOT been done at first, it was simply ASSUMED],
those chunks found in Antarctica seem certain to have been ejected
by EARTH volcanoes!  An example of rampant incompetence!)<p>

An obvious problem exists in Physics today!  There are all sorts of theories
thrown around such as where someone claims that some large object hit the
planet Uranus so hard that it was knocked on its side to now rotate (very
quickly) strangely (sideways).  Or that a similar huge collision knocked the
Earth into its tilted axis that causes our seasons.  Don't those Physicists
know even the basics of Gyroscopic Precession where they can easily
mathematically prove that such silly ideas are impossible?  Or around a dozen
other similar claims of powerful impacts that allegedly caused
enormous changes in the rotation of some planet.  Those things might sound
fine to non-Physicists, but in Physics Kindergarten, we all learned
about the Conservation of Angular Momentum and its many consequences
regarding gyroscopic motions.  NO Physicist who has a valid Degree
should possibly believe that ANY impact could massively alter
the spin axis of any planet.  In case they slept that day in
Kindergarten, they should get a bowling ball spinning fast, suspend it
on a gimbal mount and TRY to throw things at it or fire things at
it to cause its spin axis to change.  Also, allegedly smart scientists
aggressively claim that the many trillions of tons of the Core of the
Earth has completely flipped over, to then spin in the
opposite direction, HUNDREDS OF TIMES, and even without
any such ferocious impacts, for their explanation of why many rocks have
evidence of the Magnetic Field of the Earth having
reversed.  It turns out that a smart guy about 200 years ago named Euler
PROVED that cannot be done!  And EVERY Physicist or even Physics student
can easily do that math to show that such claims are silly!
It is not even a very hard problem to prove!  How could so many stupid
ideas have gotten fully adopted as true?<p>

The Physics community has quite a few other concepts which have
absolutely NO actual basis, but which have become universally
accepted as fact!  Around 1912, Einstein developed a mathematical equation,
which another scientist, Schwarzschild, solved in 1916. For one specific
situation, Schwarzschild got a mathematical answer that became infinite,
because the denominator of his answer became zero, at one specific location.
<b>THAT mathematical &quot;singularity&quot; is the ENTIRE basis for the alleged existence
of Black Holes!</b>  People added in assumptions, and later Physicists
accepted those assumptions as valid and then added on lots of new ones.  NO
Black Hole has ever been seen or otherwise detected, but now there are many
BOOKS written regarding subtle details of their (alleged) functioning!
Thousands of Physicists have spent their entire careers trying to (mathematically) 
prove some new assumptions they want to add in!  <b>And there may actually
be no such thing as Black Holes at all!</b><p>

Many or most modern Physicists now believe that
the MAJORITY of the Universe is in zillions of tiny objects that we
cannot see and will never be able to see.  And what is the basis for that
Dark Matter or Hidden Mass?  A SINGLE thing that confused Physicists
of around the 1930s!  Hundreds of years ago, a guy named Kepler
discovered some patterns in the movements of the planets, and then
later Newton mathematically prove why those patterns existed.  The result was
that Kepler created three &quot;laws&quot; regarding such things.
Kepler and certainly Newton absolutely KNEW that those laws were ONLY
valid BECAUSE nearly all the mass of the Solar System is inside the
Sun, or what is called a point source.  During the 1920s on, understanding
of the motions of our Milky Way Galaxy were developing.  <b>For some
incomprehensible reason, the Physicists decided that Kepler's laws
must apply for the Galaxy as they do for the Solar System.</b>  But that
should have been immediately obvious to all of them that the mass of
the Galaxy is all spread out, and it clearly cannot act as though
all the mass was at a single point.  And then they
soon discovered that the motion of the Galaxy does NOT comply with
Kepler's laws.  Unbelievable!  They first made a horribly wrong
assumption (since the mass of the Galaxy is distributed very broadly
and Newton had earlier proved that Kepler's laws should immediately
have been dismissed as not applying),
and then decided that we had enormous problems because the Galaxy was
not rotating as Kepler would have said!  How could they have made the
first huge error, but then how could so many thousands of Physicists
seen all this and not even questioned the bad assumptions?  And then
dozens of foolish speculations which have all been dreamed up to
resolve the (invalid) problems they saw existing!  (There actually IS a
rather simple and obvious explanation of why the Galaxy rotates as
it does, and it is entirely based on SIMPLE gravitation as Newton
presented it!)<p>

As often happens, I am rambling!  Sorry!  I realize that you are an
innocent bystander and here is some cranky Physicist railing about an
extremely small number of pseudo-intellectuals!  But there are half a dozen
OTHER major areas within Physics where truly poor assumptions had
been made and that NO ONE then challenged them!  So, in my opinion, modern
Physics is currently pretty screwed up!  Physicists seem free to dream
up the most outrageous idea and then get silly ideas adopted without
much question! It is truly sad.<p>

Please tolerate one more!  One you were probably taught in school was the
Twins Paradox, where Einstein's Relativity Theory allegedly would cause
identical twins to become different ages!  General Relativity certainly has
many peculiar consequences,
but THAT does not happen to be one of them.  Some Physicists made a really
poor assumption in the early 1960s, and no one ever questioned or
challenged their claims!  It is very frustrating, as Physics is commonly
considered as the very pinnacle of intellectual fields.  How is it
possible that so many very wrong ideas get developed and immediately get
fully adopted as true?<p>

I will chill out regarding Physics subjects and move on to things
you are probably actually interested in!  As much as it is possible
for me to do that!  I have web-pages about each of those subjects, which
are listed in the Advanced Physics link listing section below.<p>

<hr>

Just to confirm that I am not your average egghead:  This Domain
contains some really weird things!  <b>Modifying a COW to possibly become
a SUPER-COW?</b> <a href="#14"><sup><b>footnote14</b></sup></a>  Should this

<hr>

I have discovered a fascinating pattern in people!  People who consider
themselves to be &quot;important&quot; NEVER have the time to actually READ
any things such as my presentations.  So they NEVER have the slightest chance
of actually learning whether there is anything of value in any of this!
In more than 14 years of these presentations being on the Internet
in this Domain, countless thousands of people have visited, and many
of them have actually READ a presentation or two!  But &quot;important&quot;
people never Surf the web-in the first place, but even if they do,
they seem unwilling to allocate more than 15 seconds to any
presentation!  So at most, they read a sentence or two.  In an amusing
related fact, just from those 15 seconds, many of them then ASSUME
that they have a COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING of the entire presentation
(which often took a number of years to research)!
(They are virtually always wrong about that!)  There have actually
been several dozen of those &quot;important people&quot; who have
visited my presentation on Global Warming.  I have received some
very insulting e-mails from such people (or more often their
underlings who can waste the time to send an e-mail to me!)
where they rip into me for not understanding the Solar Constant
and using a wrong and obsolete value for it (where they never
read enough of my presentation to see that I include one of the
most comprehensive discussions anywhere on that matter!); or
my not understanding the effects of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere (again, they never read enough to find that I again
include one of the world's most comprehensive discussion on
that matter!).  I suppose it is really easy to be spouting
criticisms when you simply ASSUME you know what the text of a presentation
actually says!  Sort of funny, actually!  But it essentially
results in NO actual leader in any government or major business
ever being aware of the contents of these pages!  But many thousands
of &quot;average citizens&quot; actually read and then (hopefully)
actually learn interesting and important stuff!  Go figure!
(I have a feeling that in ten or twenty more years, some of those people
MIGHT actually decide to FIND THE TIME to read one or more of these
presentations.  In some cases, that will be far too late for
any actual actions on their part.  I find that extremely sad.<p>

Of course, maybe they are correct in simply blowing all this stuff
off.  There have been Physicists before me who have only had
worthless and garbage ideas!  Who can say for sure that I don't
belong in that category?  It is up to any reader, who ACTUALLY
would read any of these presentations, to try to determine that!<p>

<table width="100%" bgcolor="#ddddff" id="text7">

<tr><td>
An important comment seems appropriate here!  I was educated at the
University of Chicago as a scientist, and it seems that they did
a fairly good job inside my skull.  I actually think they FAIL with
many of their other students, but for a peculiar reason!  Nearly
all of my classmates in Nuclear Physics were incredibly arrogant!
They simply could not imagine that they would EVER make any error!
In my opinion, they therefore probably made lousy scientists!<br><br>

What an outrageous thing to say!  Here is why.  ALL humans sometimes make
mistakes, make poor assumptions, use poor logic, and arrive at poor
conclusions.  Even them!  Even me!  A CRITICAL characteristic of being a
good scientist is to NOT TRUST OR ASSUME ANYTHING!<br><br>

UC (forced) me to take a Graduate-Level Mathematics class which I thought
at the time was the dumbest ever!  It was a 13-week course, which had
a single goal, to prove that 1 + 1 = 2!  Do you agree in my initial
attitude?  The Professor spent the first THREE WEEKS proving in
exquisite detail that
1 + 1 was not LESS than exactly 2.  Part of the reasoning was, what if
we had not been measuring accurately enough, that maybe 1 + 1
actually equaled 1.99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999
and we just THOUGHT that quantity was 2!  Then three more weeks proving
that it was not GREATER than exactly 2.  Then three weeks more
to prove that the sum was not a Complex number (which might have had
a Real component of 2 but also an Imaginary component).
And more weeks proving that the sum of 1 + 1 did not happen to be
in some Other Dimension (where again, the VISIBLE part might have
then looked like 2).  On the last day of Class in that thirteenth
week, the Professor closed out the logic, of establishing that
1 + 1 was NOT equal to any other number or quantity, and therefore
BY DEFAULT it WAS proven that it was exactly equal to 2!<br><br>

Why was that Course so important to me?  For two separate important
reasons.  <b>First, as a good scientist, it was CRITICAL to NEVER
ASSUME something is true, just because it LOOKS like it is true.</b>
(For thousands of years, everyone on Earth believed that the Earth
was Flat, and that it could not possibly be spinning at over 1000 mph
or hurtling through space at 66,000 mph in going around that bright
thing up in the sky [the Sun]).<br><br>

<b>Second, it is equally critical to NOT ASSUME THAT YOU ARE RIGHT!</b>
Sadly, I know many Physicists who have such huge egos that they
cannot imagine that they could ever be wrong, and so even when
they dream up silly speculations, they insist that they are correct
(without providing any proof or support other than their speculation.)
SOOOOO!  I am highly critical of many people who call themselves
scientists who have this self-absorbed attitude!  <b>The CORRECT
attitude of a good scientist is to ALWAYS ASSUME YOU ARE WRONG,
and then therefore start doing the math and Physics to try to
confirm that you are right.</b><br><br>

As to 1 + 1 = 2: Two brilliant men, Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand
Russell had published a set of three books, <i>Principia Mathematica</i>
(1910-1913) which first presented this mathematical proof.  It had taken
them around ten years and around 200 pages (in PM) for that
&quot;proof&quot;.<br><br>


In my case, I OFTEN have come up with &quot;dumb ideas&quot;
which really sounded good to start with, but then when the
(mandatory) math and strict logic was applied, showed themselves
to be the dumb ideas they were!<br><br>

So THIS is the lesson of this Commentary:  <b>IF you want to be a quality
scientist, you MUST generally assume that your ideas had been wrong,
and then immediately dig into the necessary math and Physics
to try to confirm or deny your ideas!</b>  &quot;Let's build a
4,200-foot-long bridge across the Golden Gate waterway.&quot; &quot;Will it
fall down?&quot; &quot;I dunno, let's build it and find out!&quot;.
Science (and Engineering) cannot be like that!<br><br>

The presentations in this Domain often include a lot of (annoying)
formulas and calculations!  Generally, they are provided so that
any reader might then be able to &quot;do the math&quot; to
confirm or deny statements made.  After all, are you SURE that 1 + 1 = 2?<br><br>

If a reader of this happens to be an electronics technician or hobbyist,
I would have great interest in discussing the possibility of hiring
or collaborating on several of these projects that involve various
levels of advanced electronic circuitry.  It has really been very
frustrating for me to not have the necessary advanced microwave
electronics skills to get my Rape Prevention System (PSST)
<a href="http://mb-soft.com/psst/index.html">Rape Prevention Personal Security System - PSST</a>
operational.  Microwave is not necessary for the Non-Intrusive
Electronic Medical Anesthesia, but I still do not have sufficient
skills in those areas.  A far simpler system is a game system to
encourage children to be extremely active to minimize obesity.<p>

On a different front, if a reader happens to be good at
Compositional skills, the weaknesses of these many presentations
are pretty evident, even to me!  I was trained in College as
a Physicist, and my whole life has had strong interests in math and
science.  NOT in Composition!  Rearranging many of the presentations
would make them much more readable, no doubt!  People usually smile when
I tell them that I actually TRY to compose introductory and closing
paragraphs, and to not do so much repeating of concepts!  I really,
really have tried!  These are abilities I do not seem to have.
In a few cases, the existing web-page is around the fiftieth
revision, and you DON'T want to know what the first one was like!
So, there are a few which are now &quot;tolerable&quot;, but only due
to massive efforts!  I am absolutely sure that an English Major
could re-arrange and re-word a presentation in an hour or less.
Volunteers would be appreciated, even if it only regarding a
specific subject presentation that interests you!  However, the
several people who have offered to &quot;re-write&quot; my
pages seem to have all been insistent in massively CHANGING concepts or
ignoring the science or the math.  I have realized that their
motives have been good, of enhancing understandability, but why
do they seem to insist on introducing their OWN &quot;improvements&quot;
to scientific concepts which I had spent months or years in
studying?  In any case, I cannot say that I really want to
convert any of my pages into 15-second sound-bytes which present
THEIR ideas rather than my research.  So this area has been
disappointing so far.<p>

There is yet another situation where a talented writer who understands
some science might want to get involved!  In 1989, I composed an
outline for a story which is technically science fiction but it is so
solidly based on actual science that it might turn out to actually be
true scientifically!  I would think that some talented author who was
willing to work with me might make an impressive reputation and career,
as well as bushel baskets of money!  I have decided to present the
basic outline of the first few Chapters (of 25 Chapters of the entire
story), such that a prospective author might get a glimpse of the basic ideas of
my book. <b>Is this Science-Fiction or is it actual science?</b><p>

Inmates would be free to go out into fields to grow food crops or go to work in shops to make their clothing or shoes, or to work to build more bungalows or provide other services. Instead of being the current cost of around $100,000 per year per inmate for Federal prisoners, these inmates would be of minimal cost, mostly for only a few nearby Guard boats and Guards. The society on this artificial island would be nearly self-sustaining, and Inmates that enjoy the experience would be allowed to stay and be paid for their work after their time is done. They would learn how to live in society, and so they would likely be wonderful citizens after their time is done. Separate Women's

  <li><b><a href="http://mb-soft.com/public3/thornton.html">Amazingly Bad Behavior of the Village of Thornton, Illinois</a></b>
<b>We all want to believe that Police would never lie to the public.  I wish!</b>
On July 21, 2002, one of their own Thornton Police Officers, and
who was also the Fire Chief of Thornton, Illinois, Chief John W. Klaczak,
was arrested for having molested some young boys in his Fire Cadet
Program, apparently for several years. The Village apparently
felt media pressure and decided to try to smear the reputation of
a stranger, me, who happened to be a Christian Minister (which they
did not know!), and who then lived 65 miles away in a different
State (Indiana), to try to distract the newspaper and television
attention from their own failings.<br><br>

So, during the first week of school in September 2002, five weeks after
their Fire Chief Klaczak had been Arrested, they sent three Police
Cars to the local Wolcott Elementary School to take three children out
of three different Grades of school for a day to &quot;interrogate&quot;
them (the children's later description) about me! No one in the
Village or their Police Department ever talked to me about any of this!
In fact, <b>I was unaware that any of this had even happened until
three years later (May 2005) when those children happened to overcome their
fears and visited me and told me! And each Officer had
made up slightly DIFFERENT lies, all horrific, which they told those
children.</b>  The oldest boy, then 12, was told that the Police had
&quot;absolute proof&quot; that I had supposedly molested dozens of
other little boys before him!  (It seems rather clear to me that if
such claims had actually been true, then such a criminal would
have been spending many years in Prison, rather than spending years
as a popular Christian Minister of a little 501-C-3 Church in Indiana!)
The Officers obviously had LIED to the children to try to get any
of them to AGREE with what the Police had told them (and I certainly would
then have been hauled off to some Prison for the rest of my life).
<b>The Officers were clearly unaware that I was a Christian Minister, and
that I had even given several Sermons regarding the many terrible
treatments that children are forced to endure.</b>  The Officers were
clearly hoping that I had at least TOUCHED one of the kids at some time
(which I had never done, not even a handshake!), and <b>that any or all
of the three children might have said something which seemed to support
the lies that the Police Officers had made up</b>.  They knew that
little kids would never doubt Police Officers!  The Police Officers
obviously realized that a nine-year-old girl would not understand that
same lie about homosexuality, so the different Officer made up DIFFERENT
lies which they told to her.  A third set of lies were made up to tell the
other boy.<br><br>

It is frightening how possible it might have been for any of those
children who might have been so intimidated by being Interrogated by
Police as to simply agree with any of those Police lies, and I would
have then spent the rest of my life in Prison somewhere! The children
were SCARED (which I only learned three years later when they next
talked to me), and apparently the next day, the rumors around that
School were conveniently filled in by the Police and by Village
employees, so everyone in the Village knew of those lies
<b>EXCEPT FOR ME!</b><br><br>

Five years later (May 2007), in a casual conversation with the
girl who had been nine during the &quot;interrogation&quot; she happened to
make a pretty bizarre comment to me about the Police Officer
who had &quot;interrogated&quot; her in Sept 2002.  She was older then (14)
and she smiled as she asked if I knew why the Officer had asked
her <b>&quot;about two dozen times&quot;</b> if I had been wearing &quot;pants
or shorts&quot; while I had been pulling weeds in my yard or while I had been
mowing my lawn!  How dare a Police Officer ask a little girl, over and
over, such an aberrant question?  Does Thornton have a &quot;Dress Code&quot;
for people who were pulling weeds in their own yard?  Her 14-year-old
smile suggested to me that she realized how bizarre the Police
Officer had been.  I have long wondered since she informed me
of that Twilight Zone type stuff if there is an &quot;official
transcript&quot; of that &quot;interrogation&quot; of her, where two dozen
such questions by the Thornton Police Officer might be in some
official archive!  But I cannot imagine that the Thornton
Police Department could be so stupid as to KEEP such transcripts!
My guess is that such records have been &quot;conveniently lost&quot;!<br><br>

<hr>

Many years later, I think that I may have figured out WHY and HOW Thornton
had decided to make up such vicious lies against me, which certainly
totally ended my career as a Christian Minister and as a respected
person, although, since NO ONE EVER TALKED TO ME ABOUT ANY OF THIS (except
for those three children, years after the fact, I have no way to
PROVE that this is what Thornton had done.  Unless the Thornton Village
Police or the Thornton Municipal government still have the &quot;official
transcripts&quot; of those &quot;interrogations&quot; of those children,
there probably is no way to prove that this is what they did.<p>

Beginning in early 1997, our Church uploaded thousands of scholarly
Christian articles onto the Internet, and within months, we were getting
astounding numbers of people, around the world, who were reading those
articles.  Our tiny Church is in a desolate area in northern Indiana,
and our computer with which we answered e-mail (Christian) questions
was in our Church.  At that time, the Internet was very new and a very
slow telephone modem was the only way to receive or send e-mails.  Even
before the end of 1997, I was already spending 12 to 16 hours every day
in reading and answering such e-mails.  My life was exclusively in e-mails
and sleeping!  At that time, much of e-mails was &quot;junk e-mails&quot;.
A young man who lived near our Church offered to help out.  He could not
actually answer the Christian questions, but he was very helpful in
READING the e-mails and deleting the junk e-mails.  This was wonderful,
as now I only had to spend 6 to 8 hours every day in answering the
e-mail questions.<p>

The young man had a key to the Church so he came and went as he wished.
Initially, I did not realize that he soon started spending several
hours every day on the Internet (when I was not around).  By 2002,
I started to realize that he had been spending his time on porn web-sites.
I got rid of him as soon as I realized what he had been doing, event though
I then was again spending 12 to 16 hours every day in reading and answering
e-mail religious questions.  Many years later, I came to suspect that
SOMEBODY must have been monitoring the porn activities, whether it was
the phone company or the police or someone else.  Since the internet
connection was begun by ME to do the Church activities, I am now tempted
to think that &quot;somebody&quot; might have thought that &quot;I&quot;
was doing bad things.  But no one ever came to our Church to ask and no
one ever telephoned or wrote to me or the Church about any such things,
which is why I had not ever known about any of that porn anyway.  The
young man must have deleted all references to whatever porn sites he had
visited, as I never found any evidence on our Church computer about anything
like that.<p>

Even into 2002, I was still living in the Church in Indiana, and only
driving over the 65 miles each way to this Illinois house about once every
three weeks, entirely because I had to mow the lawn.<p>

But during 2002, Thornton began to do bizarre things that eventually
forced me to permanently move to this Illinois address after that.
For example (as described below), Thornton sent someone to &quot;break into
my house&quot;, at least twice.  Nothing seemed to be stolen, but all my
neatly stacks of papers had been seriously vandalized, kicked or thrown
all over the house.  Both were really peculiar, in that a can of diet
pop was left next to the kitchen sink both times.  Clearly, the vandal(s)
had spent considerable amounts of time INSIDE MY LOCKED HOUSE, but I had
no idea what the purpose was or who had done it.  I carefully preserved
both of the empty soda cans in plastic bags and I bought a fingerprint kit
to collect many perfect fingerprints from each of those cans.  The same
person clearly had entered my house both times.  I now suspect that someone
had entered my house in the hopes of &quot;finding evidence&quot; of
those earlier activities of the young man in Kingsbury, as Thornton
clearly ASSUMED that it was ME and not the young man who had previously
been using the Church computer to visit sex sites.  In any case, SOMEONE
was clearly breaking into my house, at least twice in 2002, which inspired
me to move to the Illinois house.  There was really NO REASON for me to
move there, except to try to DEFEND MY HOUSE from whoever was breaking
into it.  I had the fingerprints, but it took me about two years before
I finally KNEW that it had been the Mayor's Secretary, a Karen Leoni,
who had been the person who had broken into my house.  (Since I moved
into the Thornton house, and I am usually inside the house, I am not
aware of any further times of anyone breaking into my house.)  (I later
learned that the same Karen Leoni was only a PART-TIME secretary to the
Mayor but she was also the PART TIME secretary of the Thornton Police
Department.  THAT explained why I had not found any broken windows or
doors during the break-ins, as all Police Departments have methods
of getting into any buildings or vehicles without breaking anything.
I also later discovered that twenty years earlier, when my mother had
lived in the house, she had several Medical emergencies and she had
given the Thornton Police a duplicate key to the house, which seems
to have now disappeared from the Police Department.  The one person
who had easy access to that duplicate key was Karen Leoni, and I later
confirmed that it was HER FINGERPRINTS which were on the empty diet
soda cans left on my kitchen counter, twice, in 2002).<p>

It then appears that the Thornton Police, or probably, more specifically
that same Karen Leoni, spend the next several years in trying to set
up an arrest of me.  I was then daily playing horseshoes with Herb E,
who lived directly across the street from me.  His house has a picture
window, and Herb and his wife nearly constantly sat in easy chairs
facing the picture window.  So they were aware of EVERYTHING that happened
in the neighborhood.  One day during horseshoes, he mentioned that he and
his wife (now both deceased) saw that at around 7:30 p.m., Karen Leoni
would walk the block down from
her house to mine, usually three times every week, to then JUST STAND
at the exact same spot on the sidewalk, and Herb said that she ALWAYS
faced the same direction, toward my house.  He was mystified that she
always stood motionless for about 12 to 15 minutes each time, and then
she would walk back home.  Herb laughed when he described Leoni standing
in heavy rain or sleet or snow, but still doing the EXACT same actions.
He also was amazed that several times during February, he saw her still
standing there for the 12 to 15 minutes when the temperature was around
ZERO (Fahrenheit).  Herb later guessed that she had done that same at least
700 times, where he calculated 'three times every week times 52 weeks
times more than four and a half years (2002-2007)'.  But we could not figure
out WHY she was so methodical about this.<p>

I still had a telephone modem connection to the internet.  I had noticed
that sometimes, around 7:30 p.m., if I had been answering e-mails on the
internet, that the computer connection would seriously slow down, for
about ten to fifteen minutes, and then it would get back up to the usual
modem speed.  I had no idea why THAT was happening either.  At that time, I
had not yet realized that my computer internet access seemed to always
greatly slow down at the SAME TIME that Karen Leoni was standing out
in the sidewalk, facing my house.<p>

In May 2008, I was sitting in my yard, pulling weeds, when someone from
AT&amp;T walked up to their equipment in their gray box on the side of my
house.  He soon STORMED across my yard to me to start screaming at me!
He was accusing me of having put &quot;some piece of electronic equipment&quot;
inside the AT&amp;T gray box.  I walked over with him to see an aluminum
device in there, about 4 inches tall and 1.5 inches in diameter, with a few
wires which seemed to connect to their wires.  This was all a surprise to
me and so I then did not see the connection of all of the above.  But I wish
it had dawned on me to ask him if I could keep that electronic device,
and better, to try to get fingerprints off of it.  But he took it away
(probably to throw it away).<p>

About a week later, this had all logically fit together.  I now am certain
that Karen Leoni's fingerprints would have been found on that electronic
device, and that SHE had put it in there so that she could use some portable
electronic device to monitor my telephone and internet activity and also
to be able to (somehow) INSERT files into my (sometimes shut off) computer.
THIS seemed be the specific reason why she STOOD OUT THERE 700 different
times for 12 to 15 minutes each time, to be able to &quot;insert files into my
computer&quot; such that she could later tell the Thornton Police to do an arrest
on me for having &quot;inappropriate photo files&quot; in my computer.  I was being
&quot;set up&quot;.  Amazingly methodically, as she made 700 separate trips
down the sidewalk to stand while her electronics was (somehow) loading files
into my computer.<p>

I later realized a possible change in this understanding.  Rather than
my earlier assumption that she was somehow &quot;turning on my computer to
insert the files&quot;, I now wonder if, instead, she was just &quot;transferring
her files into her electronic device inside the AT&amp;T equipment box&quot;, where
then, whenever I would turn the computer on, all those files might have
gotten transferred from her device into my computer, just as the computer
was booting up, something which might have occurred very fast.  I don't actually
know which of these two she did.  Initially, I leaned toward the &quot;her
turning on my computer&quot; because some guy in California had told me that
his local Police had done the exact same thing to him, where they had
some way to turn on his computer without anyone ever being in his house.
In any case, over roughly a six-year period (2002-2008), Karen Leoni had inserted
around 700,000 porn photos into my computer by her 700 &quot;adventures&quot; of
standing motionless for 12 to 15 minutes each evening, three times every
week.<p>

When I would drive over to mow the lawn during 2002, and I turned the
(Church) computer on, I benefited by using the antique Windows 95 operating
system.  All the newer OSs keep it secret when anyone &quot;inserts&quot; files
into a computer, but Win95 always made it very easy for me to find all
the files she had inserted into my computer.  In some cases, I was amazed
to find 7,000 files which she had inserted.  Until recently, I thought she
had done that during a single &quot;standing&quot; but if her electronic device could
accept her files and store them, then she might have stood there maybe
nine times in the previous three weeks since the last mowing.  So she
may have had to stand there for her 12 to 15 minutes to only insert a
thousand files into my computer at a time.  I just SAW the 7,000 new files
when I came to the then generally vacant house.<p>

I realize that the phone company probably THOUGHT that I was accessing
all those files from some porn sites, which was obviously what Karen
Leoni intended.  But she clearly did NOT know that, nearly always, I would
immediately DELETE those 7,000 files (entirely due to still using the
antique Win95 OS).  If she WOULD have gotten the Thornton Police to
&quot;make a raid&quot; (in order to find the thousands of photos that SHE had
inserted into my computer), they would NOT HAVE FOUND ANYTHING.<p>

I later realized how methodical Karen Leoni had been at trying to cause
me to be arrested, that I added the THORNTON web-page into my Internet
Domain (in 2006).  I pretty much conceded that she was not going to
stop, and since she was also the part-time Secretary of the Thornton
Police Department, it probably only awaited her thinking she had inserted
enough nasty photos to ensure that the Police would find something.  So,
I composed the Thornton internet web-page with the intention that it would only
been seen TWICE, once by some Lawyer for me and then by the Judge that
would be deciding whether to send me to prison for all the effort that
Karen Leoni went to.<p>

In the twelve years that my Thornton web-page has been on the Internet,
it turns out that more than 35,000 people have read my Thornton internet page so far.  I wonder
if some people have decided to NOT move to Thornton after having read
my accounts of how as Christian Minister has been treated in this
Village?  The population of Thornton seems to be dropping.  I wonder
if there is any connection.<p>

I also bought and installed five different motion sensors and five
outdoor video cameras and a VHS recorder, NOT to defend my house from
criminals, but rather to defend my house from the Thornton municipal
government and its local Police Department.  The next time Thornton
decided to break into my house, I would not only have the fingerprints
like before but now also an actual videotape of their approaching and
breaking into the house.  I had sent some e-mails about my new motion
sensors and video cameras to friends, and since Karen Leoni constantly
monitored my phone and e-mail, she immediately knew about this change.
As far as I know, no one from Thornton has again broken into my house
after I installed the motion sensors and video cameras.<p>

I realize that I would never have any way to PROVE many of these actions
by Thornton, Illinois.  Even though I definitely confirmed that it was
Karen Leoni who had brought the diet pop cans into my locked house, no
Judge would accept that as she would simply deny it was her.  Ditto for
her fingerprints on some POSTAL MAIL that I had mailed to my house, where
I used gloves to fold the typewritten letter to make sure that no
fingerprints were anywhere on the letter, but when the (three separate
experiments) letters arrived, they each HAD fingerprints which turned
out to be Karen Leoni's.  And since Herb and his wife are now deceased,
I can't even confirm that Karen Leoni had stood outside my house 700
times, motionless and staring at my house (or actually, staring at the
gray AT&amp;T equipment box that contained her electronic device inside it).<p>

I might be a slow learner!  Now that I am on WiFi, I again accepted a
young man who offered to help in the relentless e-mails from religions
people.  In each of the past 18 years, my Domain traffic has confirmed
that <b>one million people every week have accessed my web-pages</b> 
(which is 50 million hits every year).  (21,000 of my 23,000 web-pages
are specifically on scholarly religious articles, so the mass of my
traffic has continued to be religious in nature.)  In any case, late in
2017, I discovered that the young man (DIFFERENT from the earlier one)
had apparently also been using our Church computer and WiFi to access
porn web-sites.  He also had tried to delete all such references, but
modern Operating Systems keep (hidden) copies of all such files so I
found them and immediately chased him off!  I guess I am destined to
spend a life of constantly answering e-mails, without any help.<p>

<hr>

I had been Saved as a Christian in 1965, partly because my girl friend then was
an extremely fervent Christian.  As sometimes happens with new Christians,
it occurred in an instant and in a peculiar situation.  She and I had gone to
downtown Chicago to have dinner and then go to a movie there.  We were holding
hands as the cartoons were showing prior to the main feature movie.
<b>VERY suddenly, I became Saved!</b>  I remember turning to her and telling
her that we needed to leave the theater and to find a Church nearby, as
I wanted to get Baptized!  (I had been Baptized twice as a child, without
actually knowing what was going on.  At a picnic at Cedar Lake, Indiana,
some man [who must have been a Minister] took several of us little kids
wading out into the lake, and then he came up behind me and flipped
me over backwards to nearly drown me under water.  I came up coughing
as I was full of water, very confused, and terrified.  For some years, I
was very negative regarding whatever Christianity was.)<p>

From age 19 on, I was a pretty solid Christian, although I was often very
disappointed in a number of individual Churches and Ministers.<p>

Much later, in 1991, I attended some Meetings in the basement of a large local
Church, and I was amazed at how poorly informed many of the speakers
were, where they expressed things that were clearly wrong regarding
Christianity.  I had bought a new computer about then, and it came with
a variety of CD-ROMs, one of which was a collection of thousands of
Christian scholarly articles and texts.  I was learning a lot about computer
programming then and I decided to 'invent' a 'compressed computer language'
where I squeezed several hundred of those scholarly Christian articles
to fit on a 1.44 MB floppy diskette, along with the de-compression
programming and formatting.  I then bought a hundred blank floppy diskettes
and put all that scholarly Christian information on the floppy diskettes.
Between 1992 to 1996, I created and handed out around 400 of those floppy
diskettes, to anyone who I thought might benefit from the information.
I refused accepting any payment for the floppy diskettes and so I spent
around $400 in buying all those blank floppy diskettes.  I have no idea
how many people ever actually stuck the floppy diskettes in their
computers, and I always hoped that at least a few did.  The program I
created was self-loading and self-starting, so anyone who tried to
look at the 'BELIEVE Floppy Diskette' would see a list of Christian
subjects to pick on and click, to read the scholarly articles.<p>

In June 1996, another man and I began our 'A Christ Walk Church'.  For
a while, we met in restaurants and in my house basement.  He eventually left
and I continued being the Pastor of the A Christ Walk Church.<p>

In January 1997, AOL advertised on television a FREE opportunity to
try the new 'Internet' thing.  Since it was free, I signed up.  I did
not really understand what it meant to 'upload files to the Internet,
but AOL also said that it was also free to upload up to 2.0 MB of files.

I imagine that most people had photos of their dogs and cats and children,
but all I had was my BELIEVE Floppy Diskette program, so I uploaded it.  At
that time, uploading was amazingly slow (1200 baud) over a telephone modem
interface, so it took around two hours for me to upload the floppy
disk files to the Internet.  I figured that if even ONE person would
download and then use the BELIEVE program and files, that would be a
good thing.  In the next few weeks, over 400 people downloaded the
BELIEVE information!<p>

I was not entirely sure just what happened, but I did notice that 400
people obtained the entire BELIEVE set of files in just a few weeks,
where it had taken me four years of buying $400 of floppy diskettes
and formatting them and handing them out to individuals.  That HAD to be
a good thing!<p>

I did not stay with AOL but I contracted with an Internet Server in
May 1997.  Within weeks, thousands and then millions of people downloaded
BELIEVE.  Within a couple years, 1999, more than 20,000,000 people were
accessing the BELIEVE Internet articles every year.  Again, if even ONE
person had downloaded BELIEVE and gotten some benefit from reading what
a Christian scholar had written, I would have been happy.<p>

I had bought an old factory building in northern Indiana in October 1976, and
was not really using it for manufacturing woodstoves any more, so by 1996,
that building began to be used for our A Christ Walk Church.  I converted
part of the eastern part of the building into an 'apartment' or 'Dormitory',
where I then lived.  I had expected to live there forever afterward.<p>

By the end of 1997, the BELIEVE web-site was already getting enormous
amounts of traffic.  A friend noticed that my Domain was getting more
visitors than even the US PGA golf web-site was getting.  Really amazing.
And a LOT of people were sending in e-mail questions about religion.
<b>It soon got to be that another e-mail question came in every FOUR MINUTES,
day and night.</b>  I was often taking ten minutes to research and compose my
responses so I was ONLY answering e-mail, fourteen hours every day,
and I was still getting farther and farther behind.  A young man who lived
near the Church in Kingsbury, Indiana offered to help me answer e-mail.
At that time, all sorts of businesses had begun to send massive bulk
e-mails and junk mail, and even though he could not answer any of the religious
questions, he was wonderfully helpful in reading through incoming e-mails
to delete the junk mails.<p>

This improved MY life into ONLY needing to spend 8 to 10 hours on most days
in answering the actual religious questions.<p>

The young man had a key to the Church building so he came and went as he
pleased.  Eventually, by about 2001, even though this was still really
helping regarding the e-mails, I had begun to be concerned about something
else.  <b>Whenever I was NOT around the Church, I came to notice that there
was a lot of traffic on the telephone modem.</b>  I wasn't actually sure of
what he was doing on the computer when I was not around, but I began to have
some concerns.  The 'memory' of the computer began to start including a lot
of photographs of young girls.<br><br>   

<b>Many years later, I came to realize that the young man had apparently been
accessing porn web-sites on the Church's computer.</b>  When someone does
that, I still don't really know if or how anyone else could know about it,
but I have come to wonder if someone in some government might have thought
that this had been ME using the Church computer for such things.  I still do
not know for sure, but that might explain some rather bizarre incidents
I experienced in 2002, in Thornton.  Even thought the young guy was really helping
me by deleting many thousands of junk e-mails, I suggested that he stop
'helping' our Church in early 2002.<br><br>

In 1997, my mother had passed on, and she left a vacant house in Thornton,
Illinois.  The house remained empty, but every couple weeks during the
summer, I had to drive across the 65 miles from the Church to mow the Thornton
lawn.  I eventually started moving stacks of my scientific and religious
research papers from the Church to various rooms in the large (empty) Thornton
house.  I found it easier to find and look through all of my research on the
many areas of scientific research which I studied.<br><br>

<b>One time in mid-2002 when I had driven across to mow the Thornton lawn, and
I unlocked the door to get into the securely locked house, I found a lot of
vandalism that had occurred inside the house.</b>  There was nothing of value
in the old house, but many of my stacks of papers
had clearly been kicked over.  On the kitchen sink counter, there was a can
of diet soda pop.  In my entire life, I have always hated the taste of
diet pop, and I knew that no one else had been inside the house for at least
five years.  So I was sure that whoever had done the vandalism had also
brought and drunk the diet pop.  I am also fairly smart and I know that robots
make all cans of soda pop and package it, so I knew that NO human fingerprints
could possibly have gotten on that can except for whoever had 'broken'
into my house.  So I carefully put the can in a plastic bag and I bought a
fingerprint kit.  The next time to Thornton then resulted in several perfect
fingerprints, although I could not figure out how to identify them.<br><br>

About a month later when I came to mow the lawn, the interior of the house 
was again vandalized and another can of the same brand of diet pop was again
on the kitchen counter.  I had also intentionally left my vacuum cleaner
in the middle of the kitchen floor and I had very carefully CLEANED the metal
attachments of it.  This resulted in another set of excellent fingerprints
from the diet pop can and more perfect fingerprints from where the person had
touched the vacuum cleaner hose.<br><br>

In both of those times, I had VERY carefully checked each of the 48 glass
windows of the house but none were broken.  I checked each of the doors to
see if anyone had damaged anything in breaking into the house, but I
found no damage.  I also checked the entire exterior
of the house for even some small hole where any animal might have gotten
inside, but there were none.  Really a puzzle.  IF it were a human, and
the diet pop cans and fingerprints seemed to prove that, it was NOT clear
how they had gotten inside my very securely locked house.<br><br>

In the Autumn of 2002, a friend of mine from South Holland had gotten
thrown out of his parents' house, and he began living in his Chevy Camaro.
So I walked down the two blocks to the Thornton Village Hall to ask what I
thought was a reasonable question.  I had NOT talked to ANYONE in Thornton
in the previous ten years.  But I barely got my question about temporarily
allowing my very good friend to live in my house for a few weeks until he could
find an apartment, and a fat red-haired matron came up and started SCREAMING
at me.  It was hard to believe that she was even breathing, she was
screaming so intensely and viciously at me.  She ended by announcing that
she would alert the Thornton Police to watch for any car other than mine
parked in the dead end street, where she would then Condemn my house and
have it Demolished.  I didn't even have any idea who the matron was, and
I certainly had no idea why she was screaming at me in the middle of the
Thornton Village Hall like that.  But I did NOT let my friend stay in
my house so he remained living in his car.  My understanding of America
was that I actually COULD help a person in stress, especially in a totally
empty home.  Apparently, that is not allowed in Thornton or it is not allowed
by me.  I began to wonder if I had to get that fat woman's permission before
I could ever have a girl friend share the house!<br><br>  

I have never had the slightest idea WHY she vented on me so viciously.
I later learned that she was about seven years older than me, and I wondered
if my half-brother (also seven years older than me) had offended her back
when they went to Elementary and High School together.  I still do not
know WHY she developed such an amazing hatred of me.<br><br>

I DID later learn that she was the Mayor's (part time) Secretary and she
was also the Police Department's (part time) Secretary, a woman named
Karen Leoni.<br><br>

The next Spring, three male neighbors and I were pitching horseshoes
on my front lawn one afternoon, and some guy drove up in an unmarked
white pickup truck. He turned around in the short dead end street and came
up near me.  He waited until I came up to his truck.  <b>He never said a word at
all.</b>  He just HANDED me a red piece of paper and drove off.  The red paper
was a <b>Cease and Desist Order</b> although NOTHING on the entire Form had
been filled in, except for the date of April 1.  The horseshoe guys wondered
if we were not allowed to play horseshoes.  They also wondered if somebody
was doing an April Fool's Joke on me.<br><br>

Note that, other than the three men who regularly played horseshoes
with me, I have never even TALKED with anyone else in Thornton.  And
absolutely no one in Thornton had any idea that I was a highly respected
Christian Minister in Indiana.<br><br>

Soon after, I walked the two blocks down to the Village Hall to find out
what the 'blank red Form' meant.  I was still uneasy since the ONLY
previous time I had been in their building was when the fat red-haired
woman spent the time screaming at me.  Apparently, it was a Village-wide
view of me!  This time I was told to WAIT for some guy who was even more obese,
probably around 400 pounds.  He IMMEDIATELY announced to me, with a big
smile, that he was going to Condemn and then Demolish my house.  (This was
the ONLY conversation I was ever to have with Harry Nolan, the part-time,
$18/hour, Building Commissioner).  He never actually told me WHY he was going
to Condemn and Demolish my house, but I got the hint that a few weeks
earlier, I had tacked a few roofing shingles onto an area of my garage,
about the size of a bathtub, maybe a dozen shingles, that had been leaking.
He had apparently decided that I HAD TO apply for a 'Building Permit' to do
that, and I had certainly not realized that such a small repair project
actually required a Building Permit.  <b>Mr. Nolan DEMANDED that I apply for
a Building Permit from him on that day, but he added "It really won't
matter, because in exactly 90 days, he WAS going to Condemn and then
Demolish my house"</b> (always with that big smile).  He added that (still
with that big smile), he had ALREADY Condemned and Demolished more than
a dozen other buildings in Thornton.<br><br>

I was certainly puzzled, partly due to yet another person in the Thornton
government who seemed to have an amazing hatred of me, but also partly
because I had previously thought that the main point of a 'Building
Commissioner' was to INCREASE the tax rolls of a community and NOT to
thrive on demolishing buildings.  (I later found that in the entire
decade of 2000-2009, Harry Nolan ONLY issued Permits for a total of TWO
BUILDINGS to Thornton, and one of those was a garage!)<br><br>

I did all the work that Harry Nolan demanded of me, which included
entirely re-roofing both my large house and the garage, of repairing and
re-painting all of the 48 glass windows of my fairly large house, but
I never could find anyone who would enable my refurbished house to
exist beyond Harry Nolan's 90 days.  People said that ONLY THE MAYOR
could possibly overrule Harry Nolan, but most of them pointed out that
the Mayor Jack Swann and Harry Nolan were very good friends.<br><br>

A partial explanation arrived on May 7, 2003, when in a casual phone
to Mayor Swann on May 7,2003, in the hopes of persuading him
to keep my house from being demolished.  The Mayor was pleasant (as
he apparently had not yet known of whatever 'universal attitude' that the
Village of Thornton seemed to have against me.)  But the Mayor explained
that 'whatever Harry Nolan decided, that was fine with him'.  So all
hope regarding my house were totally extinguished. I even asked the Mayor if
I would be allowed to tent-camp on my property, once the house and garage
had been demolished.  The Mayor did not see anything wrong with that. And, in
principle, that would have been the end of the phone conversation.  However,
the Mayor apparently was in a mood to vent.  Three houses away from his
house, a Black family had moved in as renters, at 201 North Hunter Street.
Otherwise, Thornton had always been 100% White.  I later learned of
dozens of other 'prominent citizens' of Thornton who were (and are)
ferociously racist.  I do not know if that Black renting family had
done anything wrong or not, but the Mayor made a comment that terrified
me.  He rather casually mentioned that 'he had sent people from the
Thornton government to look through their house' but had not found anything
yet. I asked if he did that when the family was there and the Mayor
clarified with "No".  Then, I THOUGHT I was clarifying the Mayor's comments
by me saying that he meant that "a Court Order from a Judge for a Search
Warrant was obviously necessary" and "only Police Officers could enter
such a building".<br><br>

The Mayor IMMEDIATELY corrected me, telling me that NO SEARCH WARRANT WAS
EVER NECESSARY, and that ANY EMPLOYEE OF THE THORNTON GOVERNMENT OR ANY
EMPLOYEE OF THE THORNTON POLICE ALWAYS HAVE THE RIGHT TO ENTER ANY BUILDING
IN THE VILLAGE, as long as no window or door was damaged in the process.
I am aware that all Police have all kinds of toys to get into any car or
building as they wish.  So even though the Mayor was talking about a Black
family on his own block, I suddenly got VERY NERVOUS in realizing that
he could easily have been talking about MY house as well!<br><br>

Neither the Mayor nor I realized during that
conversation that I might have been a target of such bizarre
entry, as he was actually referring to a family in the Village that
were considered &quot;troublesome&quot; (and Black) in his comments.<br><br>

A year earlier, on two different mowing visits, I
had found the interior of my LOCKED house to be severely disrupted,
even though no door or window had been
broken, and nothing seemed to be stolen.  As a good scientist, I
realized that a nearly brand new vacuum cleaner which had been
sitting in the kitchen both times, LIKELY had NO fingerprints
on the long pipes of the vacuum, and when I checked them for
fingerprints, I found several fingerprints which were clearly
not mine. There was also an empty diet soda can sitting on my
kitchen counter (I have NEVER drunk any diet sodas in my life)
and I knew that pop cans are manufactured, boxed and shipped
by machines, with absolutely no fingerprints on them, so the fact
that I found very clear fingerprints on that can, I had
absolute evidence of who had gotten into my (locked) house.
It was about two years later that I finally got samples
of the Mayor's Secretary's fingerprints, which exactly matched
the ones found inside my (locked) house.  But at the time, I did NOT
know WHO the fingerprints belonged to, only that they clearly
identified whoever had gotten into my house.  <b>The Mayor's casual comments
in that phone conversation some months later caused me to suddenly
realize that it had been employees of the Village who had gotten
into my house (both times)</b>. So I began to always bring a drinking glass
or something else with me every time I walked down to the Village Hall,
to get someone to MOVE MY GLASS which I always put right in the way. So,
gradually, I accumulated a collection of fingerprints from various employees
of the Thornton Village government.  In fact, about a year after that (in 2004),
I was finally able to confirm that it had been the Mayor's own part-time
Secretary (Karen Leoni) who had entered my house and clearly spent several
hours in it, both of those two times.  IF she also entered it at other
times, she did not commit the extensive disruption of the contents
of the house.  Regarding HOW she got into my locked house, I am
fully aware that the Police have many methods of getting inside
locked cars and houses.<br><br>


This is mostly &quot;ancient history&quot; from about 2002, but I feel
the need to add an extra paragraph here in December 2014.  I am
not a Black, but I can relate to recent stories in the news
about incredibly bad behavior of Police to Blacks.  I feel like
I am a Retired White man in their situation!  Once I learned of this
incredible Police Misconduct, beginning in May 2005, I repeatedly
contacted EVERY Cook County, Illinois State and Federal Agency
about this. Every Agent I contacted ALL instructed me to &quot;go to the
Thornton Police Department to File a Report!&quot; (ON the Thornton Police
Department members. I saw that as absolute
insanity!  In a very small Department, what would happen to any
Report I might try to File which might cause &quot;their own brothers&quot;
to be sent to prison?  Yeah, right.  I had also tried to contact at
least 45 different County, State and Federal Agencies, even including
Police Internal Affairs (regarding Police Misconduct) of both
Cook County and Chicago.  <b>There were two incredibly important
details which I then did not know!  The Federal Government passed
some Laws where NO ONE is allowed to ever file any Lawsuit against
any Municipal government or against any local Police Department.</b>
(the Municipal Government and Municipal Police Department clearly
must feel quite comfortable in having behaved in such offensive and
illegal ways for these past ten years or more).  <b>On July 30, 2007, I
called a Diane Gaster of the Public Integrity Division of the
Illinois State's Attorney's Office,</b> as I was informed that her Office
handled Police Misconduct regarding Officers in the Towns and Villages
of Cook County, Illinois.  She told me that she saw absolutely nothing
wrong in anything the Thornton Police had done!  <b>She then told me
that if I did not like how the Thornton Government and Police enforce
the community, I should just sell my house and move to some other
area!  And then she HUNG UP ON ME!</b> The other detail I did not
then know about was that the Village is apparently functionally a
Monarchy where the government and Police are absolutely free to do
anything they wish), <b>The Form of government of Thornton, Illinois
is a version of Home Rule, which pretty much gives them
amazing freedom to do anything they wish.  No higher authority of
government has ANY authority over anything Thornton decides to do.</b><br><br>

Getting back to the events of September 2002,and the outright LYING
of at least three different Officers in their 'interrogation of those
children'.
I am not a Lawyer, but it sure seems to me that since there were
THREE different Officers involved, each fabricating slightly DIFFERENT
lies about me on the same day, that seems to me to be absolute
proof that they had Pre-meditated those actions and they could not
have been accidental mis-statements or the actions of a single
rogue cop.  In other words, isn't that absolute proof that the
Thornton Police Department CHOSE to destroy my career as a Minister,
my reputation as an admired person, and my life?  And doesn't that
seem to suggest the word Felony, regarding their behavior?  And it
seems to explain why the highly admired, long-term Chief of Police
(Arnold) very suddenly resigned in 2006, without even giving any two
week notice and he listed and sold his house and
moved to an unknown destination, a few days after an FBI Agent
friend of mine (T.S.) had called him about my situation.  Everyone was
shocked when he left so suddenly, leaving Thornton in a difficult
spot of unexpectedly having to find a new Chief of Police, and
where he left a probable lifetime job of high pay to become
unemployed?  But a Chief of Police is responsible for his Officers,
and when SEVERAL OFFICERS were involved, AND an FBI Agent called
him about my situation, I could see how he might have realized he
could be in very deep trouble!<br><br>

Employees of the Police Department and the Village of Thornton have then
spent the following EIGHT YEARS (and counting) in repeating those lies over
and over to each and all of the 2,000-plus residents of Thornton.  As a
result, not one resident of Thornton has ever said a word to me in the past
seven years, which was also nearly true of the whole ten years.  (The
Police had never bothered to EVER even TALK to me about ANY subject, partly
because I initially lived 60 miles away in Indiana (in our Church's building) 
and originally only would be briefly in Thornton every few weeks
to mow the lawn.)<br><br>

Those Police were obviously unaware that as a Christian Minister,
or that I had given a number of
Sermons about the Sins of many aberrant sexual behaviors, including
those involving children and homosexuals and cheating.  I have never
understood how some Churches seem to overlook a Commandment of God
in deciding to permit and even encourage some behaviors!<br><br>

<b>In a bizarre way, the people who run Thornton, Illinois enabled
me to better understand the story of Jesus and His Crucifixion.</b>
Even though I have long been a Christian Minister, I had never
really grasped how Jesus could have been so &quot;Perfect&quot; and yet the
Community misunderstood Him so badly that they chose to have Him
executed by Crucifixion.  Thornton, Illinois has aggressively treated
me, a Christian Minister, amazingly badly, by having even made up horrific
lies about me and then repeated those lies so often that every single
resident of Thornton really came to believe that I am &quot;evil incarnate&quot;.
I certainly have heard stories about communities treating outsiders and
people who they believed were different than themselves, badly, but
I really never imagined that a community could treat a law-abiding
Christian Minister in such a disappointing way.  And for twelve and
a half years, and running!<br><br>

There seem to be some examples which might show that I am actually
a nice and even potential admirable person!  Since November 2000. I have
GIVEN AWAY the plans and information for a system that nearly anyone
could use to fully air condition their homes FOR FREE.  At least 21,000 people
have installed it so far.  But I have made available a &quot;Technical Packet&quot;
for anyone who feels they have an unique application.  In order for me
to send out the TP, I require that the recipient GIVE $250 as cash,
to any credible Charity (and not a dime to me!) At least 9,400 people have
requested the TP so far.  Trusting that they have each honored their word
about the Good Deed I have nudged them to make, that indicates that THEY
have collectively GIVEN over $2,300,000 to wonderful activities! (so far!)

And this attitude toward me has never wavered in the following thirteen
years.  <b>Thornton has made me pay around $3000 every year for Property Taxes
from 2002 through 2014, around $40,000 total I paid to the Village.  Shouldn't
I have gotten some &quot;Civil Rights&quot; for that?  But all I seem to have
gotten from Thornton during those 13 years has been harassment.</b>
For example, on March 24, 2014, as I was walking the two blocks
back home from the Public Library, a local dog ran out into the street
to attack me and bite the back of my left leg.  I had to hobble the
remaining half block to my house to be able to call 911.  Several
Police cars and an Ambulance showed up.  They all looked at the bite
marks on my leg, but no one wrote anything down except for my name and
address.  One of the Ambulance men tried to get me to ride to a Hospital
about the leg injury, but when I asked, he said that I probably would
be billed around $600 for that.  I felt that I should be able to drive
to a Hospital if I felt it necessary.  One of the older Police Officers
absolutely assured me that that dog would NEVER endanger me again.
NONE of the Police Officers identified themselves to me.<br><br>

<b>Less than TWO DAYS LATER, March 26, 2014, the SAME dog attacked me again, on
my way to the Library!</b>  When Thornton Police answered my 911 call, (less than
a block away) the Officer took 25 minutes to respond, and it was very
cold that morning (24&#176;F) and I got VERY cold standing along the
street waiting for the Police Car.  When he finally arrived, I politely
asked to sit in the warm Police Car and the Cop IMMEDIATELY and GRUFFLY
denied that request.  He made clear that he did not have any questions
and had no intention to File any Report.  (The Thornton Village Ordinances
REQUIRE that he Filed such a Report, and also that he Issued two Citations
for the dog &quot;running at large&quot; and for the dog &quot;attacking a person&quot;).
From inside his warm Police Car, that Officer made totally clear that
he was NOT about to File any Citation on the dog owner or to restrict
the dog's movements in any way!<br><br>

The behavior of the SECOND Police Officer was so offensive that I
contacted the Thornton Police Department to learn his identity.  <b>They
would NOT even tell me the name of the Officer who had answered my 911 call!</b>
They also would not tell me the identities of any of the several
Officers who had arrived at my house two days earlier!  They were
clearly INTENTIONALLY keeping all their identities secret!  Strange!
<b>I had not realized that Police were free to keep their identities secret!</b>
I had only heard of the Nazi Staatsi Police doing that!<br><br>

I am a pretty persistent person.  I initiated a FOIA (Freedom of Information
Act) request for both of those times when I had been attacked by that
dog.  Apparently, the Thornton Police Department handles all FOIA Requests.
And they processed mine in the way I might have expected.
A few days later, I got mail responses. I was informed that Thornton had
decided NOT to respond to my FOIA Requests regarding the first and third
dog attack on me.  Regarding the SECOND dog attack,
I learned that NO Police Report was ever Filed, and that no record
whatever of that event was ever created.  Not even any record of (any of)
my 911 calls! Or that Officer's identity. <b>The FOIA Response explained that
the Officer always has the discretion
regarding whether ANY Police Report ever gets created.</b> (I don't think that
was true or legal), and the (unidentified) Officer had decided that
he did not need or want to file any Report.  The FOIA Response also informed
me that the Officer never even bothered to talk to the dog owner, nor Filed
the MANDATORY Citation for the $500 Fine for the dog not being on a leash
or the other MANDATORY Citation for at least $500 for the dog having
attacked a person.  <b>How did the Officer get away with ignoring so many
Thornton Ordinances?</b>  After all, I have paid $40,000 in Property Taxes 
in recent years which has partly gone toward paying Thornton Police Officers,
including him (whoever he is).  Is the dog owner a more important citizen than
me where he got to slide on two significant MANDATORY Citations and Fines?<br><br>

I learned that no Officer had ever Issued the similar MANDATORY Citations and
Fines from two days earlier and that dog bite on my leg that they all saw.
I also learned that Thornton Dog Ordinances have MANDATORY Impoundment
of ANY dog which has bitten, attacked or threatened any person, but
none of that happened regarding that dog.  NO Fine, NO Citation and
NO Impoundment, either time!  <b>IF I have any &quot;Civil Rights&quot; in the Village
of Thornton, Illinois, they are hard to see.</b>  In contrast, the dog which
had (by then) attacked me twice in two days, seems to have unlimited
rights, even regarding several very specific Thornton Village
Ordinances.  The Thornton Village dog Ordinances even include one regarding
a dog which had previously bitten anyone, where such a <b>dog was to be
Impounded and Destroyed if it should ever attack any other person.</b>
Here, there was a dog which clearly merited that Ordinance of immediate
Destruction, within less than a two day interval!<br><br>

The dog owner never had the slightest incentive to control his dog,
having never received any of the MANDATORY four Citations nor the
MANDATORY four $500 Fines nor the two MANDATORY Impoundments nor
the MANDATORY Destruction of that dog.  As a result, that dog continued to
freely roam Thornton. Two months later, on June 7, 2014, <b>when I stepped out
of my kitchen door to get something from my vehicle in front of my garage,
the SAME dog attacked me a third time, this time on MY property!
I was only three steps from my kitchen door!</b><br><br>

When an Officer arrived after (this third) 911 dog attack call, the Officer
made clear that NO Citation would be given the dog owner and NO Fine.  <b>The
Officer explained
to me that &quot;since I did not have any eyewitness&quot;, he had no reason to
believe MY word over the behavior of that dog!  I pointed out that THIS
dog attack had occurred on MY PROPERTY, just three steps from my kitchen
door! I pointed out that I am a Christian Minister, but my word clearly is
not to be believed over a repeatedly dangerous dog!</b><br><br>

<b>I asked THIS Officer about the certainty that I, a Thornton Taxpayer,
clearly could not safely ever walk down the very street I live on, as
the Village seemed to have given unlimited rights to the offending dog
and its owner.  The Officer had no answer to that.</b>  <b>In the year
since the three dog attacks in 2014 (so far) I have NEVER walked down
ANY street or sidewalk in Thornton or even in my own yard, as the Thornton
Police have made clear that they have no intention of protecting my safety
from dog attacks!</b>  I had spent my 68 years in enjoying walking, which I considered
good exercise and healthy sunshine.  I commonly would walk the half-mile
to the Post Office to mail a single letter, mostly for the exercise,
but I also walked the quarter-mile to the Public Library for the
same reason.  I am now denied these behaviors that I thought all
Americans freely had, even just walking down the wonderful street I
live on.  Due to the third attack which occurred five feet from
my house back door, I have been rather terrified when I need to try to
make it the twenty feet to my pickup truck!  Maybe Thornton finds it
entertaining that I no longer can walk to the Library, but this is supposed
to be America, and I am supposed to have some rights! Just what have
I paid that $40,000 in Property Taxes for?<br><br>

It has seemed to me that OTHERS in Thornton are in danger of being
attacked by that dog, possibly children.  Had any of those Thornton
Police Officers Enforced the many Thornton dog Ordinances regarding
the three attacks on me, maybe children and others might now be safer.
I notice that there have been repeated screams from a Postal Carrier
as he passed the dog owner's house.  I wonder if Thornton Police give
any credibility to his being attacked by that same dog?<br><br>

<b>The Village of Thornton also decided that they had the authority
to do Warrantless Wiretaps on my house, beginning at least by mid-2002.</b>
This was within months of when President Bush had passed the
Patriot Act which gave the Federal government such authority regarding
possible terrorists.  The Village of Thornton apparently decided that they
had that authority to use against a Christian Minister!  But Thornton
actually went far further than the Federal government ever does,
in not only READING my e-mails and listening to my phone calls but
also INSERTING hundreds of thousands of image files into my
shut-off computer inside my securely locked house!
I never understood how or why that when I would arrive to mow the lawn, and
UNLOCKED the securely locked house and TURNED ON the computer, it often
had thousands of new files in it!  They were IMAGES of very disgusting
things that I guess a Police Department has access to, and
which they somehow were inserting into my TURNED OFF computer inside
a LOCKED HOUSE during those periods of weeks when I was not even
in the State of Illinois!  On ONE such trip, I had to delete over
7,000 image files from my computer!
It seemed to me that a small percentage of the files they put into my
computer really seemed to qualify as illegal. Most of the images
that showed up in my computer seemed to be nudist photos, which I
understand are actually legal. Many of the others seemed to be of
older women, which I understand are also legal. I wonder where
the Thornton Police obtained such photos, and I can only guess
that it was by (Fourth Amendment illegal) monitoring other people's
computers, but that is only a guess as to where they got such a
huge number of such photos.  I even found it necessary
to continue to use an obsolete computer Windows95 system, in order to
be able to FIND all the files they were regularly inserting into
my computer, as newer computers make it very difficult to find and
really delete files.  (even when you THINK you deleted a file, modern
computers still keep hidden copies of absolutely everything!) The behaviors
of Thornton Police and Thornton Village employees caused some changes in
my personal existence such as this.  Ditto regarding vetoing the
idea of using Cable or Wi-Fi or any other fast system, which would have
made it far easier for the Village to have been inserting files
in my computer, so I was forced to always continue to use
an antique Dial-Up Modem for all e-mail and internet contacts.
My friends always made fun of me for using such slow connections,
but I could never explain to them WHY I was doing that!<br><br>

A new thought has occurred to me in 2015!  Since I had never really
carefully looked at all the images that Thornton had inserted into
my computer, until recently, I had not realized that many thousands of the
image files that Thornton inserted into my old computer were pictures which
I COULD NOT have obtained!  They were photos of often hundreds of OLDER women, matrons,
attending &quot;male stripper&quot; nights, where many of the women were having
various forms of sex with the male strippers.  As I understand it, no men
are ever allowed to attend such Male Stripper nights. The new thought was that
thousands of those women who had apparently PAID to attend the Male Stripper
night were elderly, or obese, or ugly, which seemed to confirm that they
were local residents who had PAID to get their jollies, and probably did NOT
want their husbands and relatives to ever see photos of them having sex with
male strippers!  So the new thought is whether Thornton or whatever
other town Police had installed HIDDEN CAMERAS, so they could collect
possible morals evidence for future arrests.  I thought that it was
called Prostitution for people to pay money and then have sex???  Or
does that only apply regarding MALE patrons???  In any case, such Police
certainly would NOT have wanted Thornton to be distributing such &quot;evidence&quot;
photos, of some RESPECTED LOCAL ELDERLY WOMEN having sex with Male
Strippers, as such respected elderly women might sue the Police
Departments for collecting such photos of them!  Additionally, aren't
people who have such photos taken of them REQUIRED to SIGN A RELEASE
regarding THEIR IMAGE???  In other words, the fact that Thornton chose
to try to USE around 40,000 such photos against ME (or more technically, my
computer), didn't they realize the trouble I might have caused them
(and apparently other Police Departments) if I had disclosed those
40,000 photos to newspapers or other news media?  Thornton had
inserted virtually all of those images between 2002 and mid-2008 (when the
phone company had found their electronic transmitter / receiver inside the
phone company equipment box outside my house in mid-2008)  Since I actively
deleted as many thousands of such image files as Thornton was inserting
into my computer, I imagine that by 2015, I probably no longer have
access to most of those Male Stripper image files.
So, I suppose those elderly women are probably safe from being put out
of their closet, at least by me!  I wonder how many other millions of
their images of such paying-women-customers having sex with Male
Strippers are now sitting in Police Department computers!<br><br>

A partial explanation arrived on May 7, 2003, when in a casual phone
conversation (about other matters, regarding matters of a family
living near the Mayor that the Mayor felt were &quot;undesirables&quot;),
<b>the Mayor of Thornton happened
to mention that ANY employee of either the Thornton Police Department
OR the Thornton Village government
always had the freedom to ENTER ANY HOUSE OR BUILDING IN THORNTON.</b>
I thought I was correcting the Mayor in mentioning that he
meant only the Police and only with a Search Warrant from a
Judge, but Mayor Swan immediately corrected me.  He explained that
NO Search Warrant was EVER necessary, and that ANY employee of
EITHER the Police Department or the Village government could do
such entries, as they wished!  Neither the Mayor nor I realized during that
conversation that I might have been a target of such bizarre
entry, as he was actually referring to a family in the Village that
were considered &quot;troublesome&quot; (and Black) in his comments.
A year earlier, on two different mowing visits, I
had found the interior of my LOCKED house to be severely disrupted,
even though no door or window had been
broken, and nothing seemed to be stolen.  As a good scientist, I
realized that a nearly brand new vacuum cleaner which had been
sitting in the kitchen both times, LIKELY had NO fingerprints
on the long pipes of the vacuum, and when I checked them for
fingerprints, I found several fingerprints which were clearly
not mine. There was also an empty diet soda can sitting on my
kitchen counter (I have NEVER drunk any diet sodas in my life)
and I knew that pop cans are manufactured, boxed and shipped
by machines, with absolutely no fingerprints on them, so the fact
that I found very clear fingerprints on that can, I had
absolute evidence of who had gotten into my (locked) house.
It was about two years later that I finally got samples
of the Mayor's Secretary's fingerprints, which exactly matched
the ones found inside my (locked) house.  But at the time, I did NOT
know WHO the fingerprints belonged to, only that they clearly
identified whoever had gotten into my house.  The Mayor's casual comments
in that phone conversation some months later caused me to suddenly
realize that it had been employees of the Village who had gotten
into my house (both times).  In fact, about a year after that, I
was able to confirm that it had been the Mayor's own part-time
Secretary (Karen Leoni) who had entered my house and clearly spent several
hours in it, both of those two times.  IF she also entered it at other
times, she did not commit the extensive disruption of the contents
of the house.  Regarding HOW she got into my locked house, I am
fully aware that the Police have many methods of getting inside
locked cars and houses.<br><br>

Another part-time employee, a Harry Nolan, officially began the paperwork
to have my house first Condemned and then Demolished, THREE DIFFERENT
TIMES (June, August and September), all during 2003.  Mr. Nolan even
admitted that he had never even seen my house (which was less than
two blocks away from his office)! One of those
times came within one day of having a Judge authorize my house
being Condemned, still without it ever having even been seen!<br><br>

You can probably guess at how hard it would be to be a Christian Pastor
in a community where every resident was regularly re-told the horrific
lies that the Thornton Police had made up to destroy my career and my life.<br><br>

During the year 2006, the Village seemed to get especially aggressive
in their efforts at harassing me.  A Teller at my Bank joked with
me one day regarding my &quot;checking my bank balance every single
day in their web-site&quot; and I responded by saying that I had
no clue as to how to even do that.  Upon my request, the Teller
discovered that it was the Village of Thornton checking my bank
balances.  Rather odd!  But they were also monitoring and reading
my incoming and outgoing e-mails, and they even decided to send their
own out-going e-mails to anyone who indicated that they were about to
send me a check in the mail!  My previously thriving business
of providing excellent fireplace doors at nice discounts very
suddenly dropped to having no customers during January 2006.
On August 29, 2006, the cousin of President Clinton's Press
Secretary informed me that John Stossel of ABC's popular 20/20
program was extremely impressed with my energy-related web-pages
and Stossel had even already created a tentative name for a &quot;major&quot;
segment on me for 20/20, &quot;ONE MANS EFFORTS TO SAVE ON AMERICAS
POWER USAGE!&quot;.  Amazingly quickly after receiving that
e-mail, ABC News suddenly stopped all communication with me
(which continues to this day six years later!)  I can't actually
connect that incident with anyone in the Village of Thornton,
but it was mighty peculiar that Stossel and 20/20 were incredibly
enthusiastic about me one day, and from the next day on,
it was as though I had leprosy or the Plague!  Dozens of
requests from me to people in ABC News, and also to Mr. McCurry,
NEVER even received any responses after that, where we had been
having daily communications prior to that.  WHATEVER the reason
that ABC News and (both) Mr. McCurrys instantly lost interest
in me and my energy projects, I just wish I could know, and the
ONLY possibility that seems credible is that someone in Thornton
spread their vicious lies about me to those fine people.  It
certainly was completely in line with seeing hundreds of people
enjoying saving $200 each on sets of fireplace doors dropping
suddenly down to ONE customer over eight months!  So the ABC-
Stossel-20/20-McCurry incident is technically not in my list
of confirmed actions by Thornton, like all the hundreds of
other harassing behaviors which I have been able to confirm.<br><br>

I certainly wonder WHAT sort of comments by any minor bureaucrat in a
tiny Village could have said which might have caused National
organizations and celebrities to change their attitudes toward me so
severely.  For the eight years before that (1998 to his death in 2006),
my dear friend Peter Jennings (Anchor of the Nightly News on
ABC News) certainly knew the quality of my existence, and it
was unfortunate that Peter died just a few months before he
might have defended me to whatever Stossel and the others were
apparently told about me!  But the way history happened, I wound
up never knowing WHY I was suddenly eliminated from all contact
with ABC News ever again since September 2006.<br><br>

An AT&amp;T phone technician discovered an electronic device inside
their gray box on the outside of my home (in 2008) which finally
explained why some neighbors had seen the Mayor's Secretary
stand on the (public) sidewalk nearest that box, about every
other day, over 700 different
times (by the neighbor's estimate) over at least a period of four
years. (possibly longer, as there is no way to know how many years
that device had been in there, but the AT&amp;T Technician who found
it was VERY angry as he thought that I had put it inside their
equipment!)  The Mayor's Secretary would stand motionless on the
public sidewalk nearest that device, for about ten to fifteen
minutes during the evening, about every other day for more than four
years, where she could download my phone calls and e-mail and internet,
and also upload many thousands of incredibly nasty images into my
computer.  I am still fuzzy at how anyone could do such things to
a TURNED OFF COMPUTER (while I was living in a different State for
two or three weeks at a time!), but I guess Police have all sorts
of toys.  The neighbor seemed bemused that the Mayor's Secretary
would stand there, motionless for ten or fifteen minutes, even in
rainstorms, snowstorms and when the temperature was below zero!  Since
the neighbor's information told me that she always stood in the
exact same location, in 2006, I installed a motion sensor and video camera
and VCR aimed at that spot.  In a different situation, it would be a
darkly humorous scene to see the Date Stamps show the Mayor's Secretary
arrive about every second evening, and turn to face my house and stand
relatively motionless for around 10 or 12 minutes and then leave, only
to see the video of the same behavior occur again over and over, either
two or three days apart.  During the Summer of 2006, I recorded an
entire six-hour VCR tape of repetitions of that behavior of hers.  But
she stayed on the public sidewalk, and at that time, I was not
aware of the electronic device she had installed in the phone equipment.
Still, to see a video of any Mayor's Secretary spending six hours,
in ten minute segments, for around the 32 times that I recorded
her, is very bizarre.  When one considers that she repeated that
over 700 times over more than four years, wow!  (I probably should
have uploaded that six hours of videotapes of her into my Internet
Domain, or recorded her standing there during winter blizzards!)
I wonder if that would have discouraged her from doing it or
whether she would have decided to use the assets of the Police Department
to harass me even more.  (I did NOT ever record her dumpster-diving, going
through my garbage container early on garbage mornings, which also might
have made interesting viewing regarding a Mayor's Secretary!)<br><br>

Of course, at that time, during 2006, I was not yet aware of the
electronic device she had placed inside the telephone company's
equipment on the side of my home, so I still just thought she was
simply harassing me along lines that she and a dozen other Thornton
Village employees and Thornton Police Officers often did.<br><br>

During all of 2006, all of 2007 and the early part of 2008, I had
noticed that virtually every piece of postal mail I received,
with the exception of utility bills, had the envelope flap distinctly
rippled.  I knew that when someone steamed open a letter to examine
its contents, the water and heat causes the paper to expand, so
that when the letter was later re-glued, the flap showed such ripples.
NO utility bill envelope ever had such ripples but virtually every
other piece of mail I received did.  Actually, a skilled person CAN
open a letter without causing such ripples, but the employees of the
Thornton Village government apparently did not have that skill.
When it had become so clear that my mail was being monitored and
read (which I had understood to be a Federal Felony, interfering
with the mails), I even did three different experiments to verify
this.  Any Secretary knows that once a letter is folded, it is
supposed to be inserted into the envelope such that the letter falls
open by the reader.  But I intentionally inserted a typed letter
UPSIDE DOWN in the envelope.  Not only that, but I bought a pair
of surgical gloves to get the brand new sheet of blank paper and put it
in the typewriter, and then to fold it and insert it into the
envelope.  In other words, I ensured that there were NO POSSIBLE
FINGERPRINTS on the letter inside the envelope.  I made up a message
regarding a possible interest in buying some product from me,
as I had already learned that Thornton had a clear fascination
with anyone who might consider sending me any money.  And, on three
different dates, several weeks apart, early in 2006, I took such a
letter to a nearby town and mailed it to my own address.<br><br>

In each case, it took either eight or nine days before the letter
was delivered (for a three mile trip in the mails!)  In each of the
three cases, the envelope flaps showed the usual ripples in the
paper, which indicated that someone had steamed the letter open.
When I opened the envelope, the letter was RIGHT SIDE UP, which
confirmed that someone had opened the envelope and removed the
letter but they re-inserted it in the envelope in the NORMAL
way and not upside-down as I had mailed it.  And finally, I used
a simple fingerprint kit and found around 15 fingerprints on each
of the three letters, which each SHOULD HAVE BEEN pristinely
fingerprint-free!  I actually now had ABSOLUTE PROOF that SOMEONE
had been violating Federal Law regarding opening private mail,
AND I EVEN HAD FINGERPRINTS TO PROVE WHO IT WAS (the Mayor's
Secretary, in all three cases).  Those fingerprints on those three
letters exactly matched the fingerprints I had found on the soda
pop can and the vacuum cleaner inside my locked house four years
earlier.<br><br>

However, I realized that since I had NOT had any witnesses see
me assemble any of the three letters, and no witnesses had seen
the ripples in the envelopes, and no witnesses had seen me
open any of those letters or seen me use the fingerprint kit,
I knew that no Judge would consider any of that as actual
evidence.  So even though I now had ABSOLUTE PROOF and even
the exact identity being the Mayor's Secretary, I knew that
I did not have sufficient proof for a Court.  However, it DID seem
a moral victory to have gotten such impressive evidence from my
three experiments, and I finally eliminated any doubt regarding
WHO was at the center of the harassment of me.<br><br>

As to HOW Village employees could get access to MY mail, it
seems clear that someone in the local Post Office must have
been involved.  The then Postmaster seemed regularly very nasty
to me, and I have always assumed it was her, but with no proof.
Several years later (in 2009) a very nice Postal Carrier remembered
that any mail to or from me was to be &quot;set aside&quot; but
she did not know why, or what happened to it.  But at least I
started to understand why mail NEVER got to me in any
timely fashion, as it had up to the beginning of 2006, but that
ANY mail always then took at least eight days in transit.<br><br>

By the way, as a very thorough scientist, I also kept track of
mail that I SENT to one specific friend.  To go from Illinois
to Indiana, it always took around ten days (but that dropped to
the standard two days early in 2008, which I took as a confirmation
that Thornton might have finally decided to stop reading my mail!).
My friend knew that I would intentionally insert the letters
upside-down, but he always confirmed that they arrived right-side-up.
I was never able to get him to buy a fingerprint kit, so he never
checked whether there were any fingerprints on letters where there
could not have been any.  After mid-2008, my mail, both inbound and
outbound, seemed to no longer have ripples in the envelopes and
it arrived in the correct timely intervals.<br><br>

 One more bizarre incident apparently regarding their aggressive
 intention of having my house Condemned and Demolished during 2003.
 It seems clear that the Village employees must have felt that they
 saw some reason INSIDE my house which they wanted to add to their
 claims of having it destroyed, but they could not easily admit to
 knowing such things without also admitting that they had broken
 into my locked house!  So one day when I was hosting three men
 neighbors in our daily horseshoe games, a white pickup truck
 showed up and stopped near one of the other players, to offer him
 a job as a laborer.  We all thought it was peculiar that anyone
 would drive up to a total stranger and offer a job, but he went to work
 the next morning.  He later was laughing when he mentioned to the
 others of us that the guy who had hired him (the husband of Karen
 Leoni, the part-time Secretary who seems to be involved in many
 of these things) spent the ENTIRE 20 minutes of the morning break
 time in asking him dozens of questions ABOUT THE INTERIOR OF MY
 HOUSE!  It turned out that Louie had never been inside my house
 and had no way of knowing what it was like.  At noon, he was either
 fired or laid off, so his new job as laborer only lasted half of
 one day!  And central in that half-day were all the questions about the
 interior of my house!  There may not actually have been anything
 illegal there, but it sure seems peculiar!  At a time when they
 were going through my house whenever I was not around, and while they
 had already tried four times in six months to Condemn and Demolish
 my house, it just seems VERY strange that Louie was hired by a
 total stranger, only to be interrogated regarding my house, and then
 dumped without even getting a full day's pay!<br><br>

The Village of Thornton, Illinois spent all those years and
several thousands of hours of effort to try to
destroy a Christian Minister!  The anecdotes mentioned here are
only a tiny part of their entire set of behaviors toward me
(which is even still continuing into 2014 as I am updating this text).
Even I find that amazing and unbelievable,
except since they did it to <b>ME</b>, and my training as a Research Scientist,
caused me to very carefully collect and document massive amounts of evidence.
They actually did FAR more than these core activities, such as Stalking
me into other towns and then trying to get those towns to arrest me for
crazy crimes, and endless harassment.  The linked web-pages present the
evidence of many of those hundreds of different events.  Not being
a Lawyer, I don't know for sure, but many of their behaviors,
by at least a dozen different individuals, seem rather criminal.<br><br>

And it all continues!  Even after nine years of this harassment,
the Village Code Enforcement Officer, named Torres, overheard a
conversation regarding why a neighbor who owns a riding mower
sometimes mowed my grass in 2011.  Torres approached the neighbor,
and instead of expressing praise for a neighbor helping an elderly
and medically frail neighbor, Torres apparently went into a
rant severely criticizing my neighbor for helping, and also adding
in some amazingly insulting comments regarding MY character!<br><br>

I had only ever first met Mr. Torres in June of 2009, when he and
others knocked on my door to inform me that they were about to
have ALL the trees on my property chopped down.  As I opened the
door, to meet for the first time someone I had never met or talked
to before, I thought it was appropriate to introduce myself!
IMMEDIATELY after I mentioned that I am a Christian Pastor,
Torres blurted out &quot;<b>No you aren't</b>&quot; which was
quite a shock to hear!  A moment later he said &quot;You claim
to be part of a Church?  I will take care of THAT!&quot; in
an incredibly threatening tone.  This was the FIRST CONVERSATION
we ever had!  He also ANNOUNCED that I had NOT replaced the entire roof
of the house in 2003 after I mentioned that I had (which he had to see
was a FINE job well done).  And his attitude toward me has
certainly not improved, but gone seriously downhill since!  One time
when I had mowed 89% of my rather large lawn, when an unusual part
inside my very old Toro lawnmower broke, and I had to wait for Toro
to send me a replacement part, Torres found the 11% that had not yet
been mowed.  Did he knock on the door to ASK why I had mowed nearly
all of the lawn but not all?  No!  Did he issue any kind of Warning
regarding tall grass?  No!  He issued a VIOLATION which instructed
me to either mail in the fine or carry it in to their Village Office!
(It turns out he was not allowed to do that without a prior Warning).
And did he put that Violation in my mail or on my doorknob or anywhere
where I might find it?  No.  He decided to TAPE IT TO THE GLASS of
one of the 48 windows of the large house, where I did not even find
it for several days!<br><br>

The Village of Thornton Municipal employees and their local Police
Officers have been told so often and for so long the lies they
made up about me in 2002, that it all never ends!<br><br>

Doesn't it seem more likely that they might have decided to go after
someone they KNEW about, that was actually even FROM their town?
Maybe even someone they knew had some kind of criminal record?
But they clearly wanted to find some target to try to distract
the trouble that their Fire Chief was in, and this all happened
only shortly after George W. Bush passed his Patriot Act.  There is
every indication that Thornton interpreted the Patriot Act as
absolute freedom to ignore all Laws and even the Constitution, as
nothing they could ever do could ever be wrong!  (That is my best
guess as to WHY they started this and doggedly pursue it all against
me.  Since none of them have ever even talked to me, I do not see
how I could have ever offended anyone, but Ministers rarely offend
people anyway!<br><br>

This is all rather amazing that they happened to pick a target where
the entire rest of the world calls and e-mails me to ask for solutions
to serious problems (evidenced by the assorted web-pages in this Domain
of mine).  Thornton seemed to not like that either, as they were quite
active in both monitoring my e-mail and even sending their own e-mails
out to people who had just been in contact with me.  Such people never
communicated with me again!  Since by monitoring my communication, the
Village already had the sending e-mail address or calling phone number
of such people, they were able to immediately contact those people (who
had respected me up to then!) to spread their old lies to people all over
the world.  Quite an impressive effort!<br><br>

<b>Interestingly, the actions of the Village of Thornton have enabled me
to get a far better insight of what had been done to Jesus!</b>  Like everyone
else, I had already read the words in the Bible where the Jews had loved
and admired Jesus just weeks earlier, but then they turned on Him and
it was THEIR decision that Jesus be Crucified.  Well, having lived
through these past eight years of Thornton's behaviors, where EVERY
neighbor has heard their lies (for the Police would NEVER lie, right?) so
repeatedly that they each and every one have deep and profound hatred
of me now.  A <b>MINISTER</b> who has never been in trouble beyond a few
Parking Tickets and has been an admired Christian Minister since 1996!<br><br>

I often wonder how effective Thornton is when their target is actually
a bad person or who has actually been in trouble!  Targets who would never
have even the tiniest chance of trying to defend themselves (as
my evidence and web-pages try to do regarding me).<br><br>

I am not a Lawyer, but my understanding of our Constitution is
that we Citizens are supposed to have Civil Rights, and that
people like Police and government (which WE pay for) are supposed
to be Civil Servants.  How does Thornton, Illinois think that their
Monarchy behaviors are compatible with the Constitution?
Specifically, as I read the Fourth Amendment, we Citizens are supposed
to be safe from improper searches and seizures, but in Thornton,
ANY employee of the government is free to ENTER any house or
building, as long as they do not have to break any doors or
windows to do that.  Isn't there something wrong there?<br><br>

Are they really ALLOWED to pro-actively and preemptively destroy
the career and life of ANYONE?  In America?  It seems they are!<br><br>

What would YOUR attitude be if whenever you were at work or otherwise
away, Secretaries (and possibly even Janitors!) would feel free to
enter your (LOCKED) house and wander around in it?  I eventually had
to buy and install a Home Security System, NOT due to any criminals
but due to trying to keep the VILLAGE and POLICE out of my house!
<b>This IS America, right?</b><br><br>

Once I started realizing in 2002 and 2003, that Thornton felt free to
enter my locked house whenever they wished, and all the phone
and internet monitoring they constantly did, and I still lived
60 miles away in Indiana, I used my creativity to try to
expand the capability of that home security system to defend my house
from the Village of Thornton.  Each time I left for the three weeks, I
made sure to leave either one or two old TVs on 24 hours every day, nice and
loud, and I placed them so that the light from the flashing TV screens would light
up walls and some window drapes.  I left an old car parked outside there, even
though the empty garage was available.  I set up a couple shadow-makers in front
of some windows, back-lit by the TV sets, so that moving shadows would be
seen from outside as though people were inside.  And I set up software so
that one rather old computer was automatically turned on several times
each day and then onto the Internet, where it would randomly
go to assorted web-sites, during the usual three-week intervals
that I was away from the house.  I figured that if they were going to
go to the trouble of monitoring and reviewing the internet activity
(of the Church computer!) inside the house, I would create as much fake
traffic as possible, to keep them REALLY occupied!  I wanted Thornton to
THINK that I was IN the house, to discourage their penchant for entering
the locked house (again) when they thought I was NOT around.  Those
efforts on my part apparently convinced them, as later odd experiences
included rather vicious criticism for me not answering the door
when a Thornton official wanted to tell me some demands!  Even though I was
far off in a different State, HE yelled at me for not answering the door! That
pretty much confirmed their constant attempts of monitoring my
activities, as well as their incompetence in actually doing it,
as they made comments which clearly concluded that I was always there!
They seemed to have no idea that I was RARELY there, generally living
IN A DIFFERENT STATE sixty miles away!  It was a lot of trouble to
have to do all of that, but it seemed to have worked as there
has not been any indication that they have again entered my
locked and generally vacant house.  I suppose that if they DID
get in again, they would have seen that the house has essentially
NO furniture or even a kitchen table, and they might then
have realized that no one was living in the house!  Sort
of darkly funny!<br><br>

An interesting future possibility seems likely.  At some point,
the world figures to realize that one or more of my energy
inventions will be worth using for the benefit of millions of people.  I would think
that situation will force people to try to finally decide whether
the lies that Thornton made up and still repeats are true or not.  The simplest
research will show that I have NEVER been in any trouble beyond a
couple Parking Tickets in a lifetime of driving.  But there WILL then
be over a thousand people who can confirm that Thornton repeatedly
told them the same lies for at least eight years.  I am not sure how
Thornton will be able to deny having made up and spread those lies
then!  <b>But since the Federal government has passed laws where
Municipal governments and Police Departments cannot
be charged with any crimes</b>, they will obviously never get in any
actual trouble for having destroyed my life!  Ah, America!<br><br>

Now, I realize that this entry seems to be a very bizarre one in the
collection of the pages in this Domain.  Why is it in here?  Well,
if you think about it, you might see!  Thornton seems to be persistent
if nothing else.  For ten years, they have tried to damage me in
every imaginable way, specifically apparently trying to set me up to
seem to be guilty of crimes which were never true. (I found
fingerprints of the Mayor's Secretary inside my locked house,
twice, in 2002; which made more sense in May 2003 when the Mayor
happened to casually mention to me on the phone that any Village
employee was free to enter any house or building in the Village;
many times when I would make the hour drive to cut the grass,
I would usually discover as many as 7,000 photographic images
in my locked house and on my shut-off computer, where I cannot
even imagine the total number of such nasty photos that the
Village had somehow inserted into my computer;
then at least from 2004 to 2008, that same Mayor's Secretary
stood for twelve to fifteen minutes about every second day,
or at least 700 times; where in 2008, a phone company technician
found a small shiny electronic device inside of their phone
equipment. So during 2007 and then certainly in 2008, I realized
what enormous danger I was probably in. By then, they had
apparently spent thousands of hours in trying to make it seem
that instead of being a quiet Minister, I was some sort of
evil person. They certainly worked at setting that up
amazingly thoroughly, for about five years at that time.
So I started to suspect that they planned to have a SWAT
Team break into my house, where they expected to find all the
nasty photos they had inserted into my computer. I thought about
whether there would be any way for me to defend against such
claims, but it seemed clear that they spent those five years
in setting that up where I probably would not be able to
present any defense. And so I realized that I HAD TO collect
all my evidence regarding the many hundreds of amazing things
they have done, and uploaded the file (or files as it turned out)
into my Domain of mostly religious information.  So each
day since about mid-2007, I have expected to see all the Village's
Police Cars fill my dead-end street to haul me away.  The fact
that THEY somehow apparently used my computer to collect
nasty photos (that I guess a Police Department probably had
collected) would certainly have made it LOOK like I was
guilty of everything they might try to claim against me.
My thinking is that at some point, I would be brought before
a Judge, and I thought that providing the link to the page,
or even getting an Attorney to print out all eighty
pages of my evidence, dated in 2007, might get a Judge to see
that things were not as he was told by them.  Actually,
I have a second reason for including these comments about
the very bad behavior of Thornton, where someone in the Village
might have found this information by now.  My reasoning is that
they might see it as very foolish to now send in their SWAT
Team, when they must now know that the Judge would see the
truth of these past ten years in the 2007 web-page information.
In any case, so far they have not broken into my house or
sent their SWAT team. Actually, many of the Police Officers
and the Village employees who were in this in 2002 have
either retired or transferred elsewhere, so maybe there are
few remaining that would be gung-ho about increasing their
harassment of me again.<br><br>

Since they seem likely
to continue those efforts, I have to assume that some day they will
break into my house and &quot;find&quot; evidence which they will have
placed there.  I recognize that no one would then believe me to be
innocent, since they have not believed me for the past eight years,
so whatever alleged &quot;evidence&quot; they will have had
placed in my house or in my computer or whatever, will be seen as
valid.  Well, now that this (2007) historical record of the evidences
of their previous activities has been on the Internet for several years,
I am hoping that some Judge might realize that THEY had done some
things wrong and not me!  I am a pretty smart person, but I have
not thought of any way to try to handle a SWAT Team attack on my
house other than this one.  IF a better response some day occurs to me,
I would really much prefer NOT to have these bizarre matters in my
otherwise high-class web-site!<br><br>

Oh, they have done a LOT of things over ten years, and I am a VERY
good research scientist, so I have documented MANY different of their
activities, so that web-page (linked above) would print out to around
80 pages!  So you probably do NOT want to print it out, and probably
do not even want to read it all!<br><br>

Of course, I have no way of knowing what other methods of
harassment they have done to me over these years. It seems likely
that they probably used their fictitious evidence to get my name
put on any of hundreds of Government Watch-lists of supposedly
dangerous people. Peculiarly, even an Officer friend of mine
(of 25 years and from another State) could apparently not
access such lists, so there is apparently no way that I could
ever know whether they put my name on such lists, or even
how many such lists. Apparently, it used to be that ANY
Police Department could anonymously add names to Government
Watch-lists, which suggests that if they got my name put
(permanently and forever) on such lists, there would apparently
be no reference to who added my name or when!  Cute, huh?<br><br>

One final matter remains.  Friends have long told me to sell
the house and move away, to have some peace, and possibly even
again be able to perform as a Christian Pastor.  I see some things
wrong with that.  First, it would be CONCEDING TO THEM and ENCOURAGING
THEM TO KEEP BEHAVING THAT WAY, possibly to countless others who
might not be able to defend themselves as well as a lily-white
Christian Minister might.  Second, it terrifies me to think of
how they must harass residents of Thornton who DO have criminal
records, or otherwise might be seen as deserving the treatment
they have dumped on me.  Third, recognizing that NO ONE is allowed
to ever file any Lawsuit against any Municipal government or against
any local Police Department, they clearly must feel quite comfortable
in having behaved in such offensive and illegal ways for these
past ten years or more.  I guess I am conceding that I have no
possible way of ever getting any of them Arrested or ever paying
any Judgment for having destroyed my career as both a Christian
Minister and as a Nuclear Physicist, but this information on
the Internet MIGHT come to the attention of someone who was
considering buying a house in Thornton, Illinois, where they
might have second thoughts.  That is not quite as good as having
those mis-behaving Public Servants arrested where they might pay for
their conduct, but if they have fewer potential victims in the
future, that seems the best I can hope for.  NOTHING is going
to stop them from having the attitudes and the arrogance they have.<br><br>

<a name="1"><font size='+2'><b>US South Pole Research</b></font></a><br><br>

In 1957, The US government (Scripps Institution of Oceanography)
began recording data at the South Pole regarding many atmospheric
contaminants.  That location was selected as being very distant
from any human activities or factories and also from any
vegetation growth or activity.  It was felt that measurements
at the South Pole would be accurate indications of the true
condition of the Earth's atmosphere.<p>

At bi-weekly intervals, air samples are collected in sets of three
5-liter evacuated glass flasks, at the South Pole (Lat. 89&#176;59'S. Long.
24&#176;48'W.).  They are analyzed for CO<sub>2</sub> at SIO (Scripps)
using a nondispersive infrared gas analyzer with a water vapor freeze
trap.  Calibration gases are regularly tested as well to confirm
accuracy.  The three sample flasks must agree within 0.40 ppmv to
be considered acceptable data.  Scripps has more thorough description
of their procedures and equipment.<p>

The readings are averaged to obtain monthly and annual average values.
Our running display uses the annual averaged figures from this South Pole
data, interpolated for each 1/10 second.<p>

If the specific interpolated value at the South Pole for an instant
were 380.0 ppmv, this means that the atmosphere was then 0.000380
carbon dioxide (by volume).  It is accurately known that the total
Earth's atmosphere is 5.136 * 10<sup>15</sup> metric tonnes.
It is also necessary to apply a density factor of 1.529 (of carbon
dioxide to the average atmospheric mixture of gases) to convert
the ppm (volume) value to ppm (mass or weight).<p>

<b>Therefore, it is simply necessary to multiply these three numbers
5.136 * 10<sup>15</sup> * 0.000380 * 1.529 to get 2984.12 billion
tonnes of carbon dioxide in the entire Earth's atmosphere at that
instant.</b>  THIS is the value that is continuously displayed here.
The value has NOTHING to do with actual usage or consumption
figures of fossil fuels, which actually generally give larger
numbers for the annual increases.<p>

What about the accuracy of those three numbers that we have to
multiply?  The density of carbon dioxide?  No problem there.
Extremely accurately known.
The measurements of the air at the South Pole?  Three identical
flasks, and when analyzed, they have to have extremely similar
values to be considered acceptable.  Ah HA!  You think that the
mass of air in the atmosphere might be off.  Well, YOU can confirm
it!  A Barometer measures the air pressure, right?  And you might
accept that it is usually around 14.7 pounds per square inch.
Do you realize what that number actually means?  It means that if
you somehow marked out a column of air, one inch by one inch, all the
way from the ground to the top of the atmosphere (outer space), that
air weighs a total of 14.7 pounds!  Cool, huh?  So now, all you have
to do is look up in some book what the total surface area of the Earth
is (in square miles) and convert that to square inches, and multiply by
14.7, to find the exact total weight of the entire Earth's atmosphere
(in pounds).  So all three of the numbers are really reliably accurate.<p>

In case you don't want to have to do this math, you already know that
atmospheric pressure (at sea level) is 14.696 pounds per square inch
(or 10332.3 kilograms per square meter).  We multiply this
(metric) number by the total area of the surface of the earth, which is
5.10101 * 10<sup>14</sup> square meters.  So YOU can calculate that the
total mass of the Earth's atmosphere is 5.270 * 10<sup>18</sup> kg
or 5.270 * 10<sup>15</sup> metric tons.  For purists, the actual total
mass is slightly less because continents and mountains take up
some volume where air might otherwise be, the 5.136 * 10<sup>15</sup>
metric tonnes used above.  (So YOUR answer is actually a couple
percent wrong, high!)<p>

<a name="2"><font size='+2'><b>Regarding Really Bad Economic Times Ahead</b></font></a><br><br>

(Written in Oct 2008) As if that news (of the Global Warming link above) is
not bad enough, I have more bad news for you!  Beginning around 1990, I tried
to get people to realize that there were bad implications of the fact that
nearly everyone was already living beyond their means, primarily due to the
massive use of credit cards.  No one seemed to accept that SOME DAY they
would have to pay for all those things they were buying and enjoying then!
As the (alleged) value of houses kept increasing, AND that banks were
willing to give amazingly large loans on all houses, many millions of
people started considering their homes to be piggy banks, providing
even more money to spend.  No one seemed to ever even consider that
home values might drop to a more realistic level.<p>

People blame ALL of our financial problems on Banks that gave home
loans to millions of people who could not possibly have afforded the
homes they wanted to buy.  Yes, the Banks have some responsibility, but
the PEOPLE who KNOWINGLY were agreeing to get such loans that they
knew that they would never be able to pay off were probably even more
guilty.  There was also a common mindset that ANYONE could buy ANY (expensive)
house and immediately sell it for $50,000 more than it was bought for,
which APPEARED to create $50,000 cash for the person who
&quot;flipped&quot; the house.<p>

During the 1990s, I often described America as having a network of
incredibly tightly strung violin strings, where if ANY of them would
break, then EVERYTHING would come apart.<p>

I sometimes described an &quot;island economy&quot; where one person
mowed lawns and another cut hair and a third made shoes.  They charged
each other exactly one dollar, and all three were happy!  But over many
years, they all felt they were not being properly rewarded and they
each raised their prices many time.  Now, they charge each other
$1,000 to mow the lawn, $1,000 for a haircut and $1,000 for a pair of
shoes.  They are all happy.  Are they any better off than at the start?
There is no REALITY to those increases, and the fact that they all
made the same increases caused there to be no actual effects at all.
But now they each have a pile of money to count, which seems to make
them feel happy.  They seem willing to overlook that a loaf of bread
which used to cost 25 cents now costs each of them $250!  And they all
describe themselves as prosperous!  (They are actually wrong about that!)<p>

I have noticed that the &quot;experts&quot; today are all telling everyone
to pay off their credit card debts.  That certainly is correct guidance,
but there are TWO huge problems!  The first is that few people have
the money around to be ABLE to pay them off or even pay them down!
The second problem is even worse, and no one seems to ever mention it!
The whole ATTRACTION of credit cards (say, ten years ago) was to be
able to have and use products that they knew they could not possibly
afford!  In other words, GETTING and USING attractive products.  The
experts today are expecting people to have absolutely reversed that
basic characteristic of human nature!  They expect people today to
PAY FOR PRODUCTS THEY USED TEN YEARS AGO!  Which means that they would
thereby guarantee that there was NO chance that they would ever be
able to get to use MODERN products!  Not with credit cards, because
they are no longer allowed to.  Not with cash, because they would
be using up any available cash TO PAY FOR THOSE ANCIENT PLEASURES!<p>

So, among the other catastrophes that we are starting to encounter,
a really huge 900-pound gorilla in the room is the fact that the very
POSSIBILITY of using credit cards in the future is somewhat unlikely at
all.  Concurrently, people today figure to be unable and unwilling
to buy new things with actual cash, meaning that nearly all markets
figure to dry up nearly completely.  So, in addition to the problem that
many businesses will soon lay off millions of people in order to
survive as businesses (by reducing expenses), that problem for the
businesses will be multiplied by the fact that there figure to be
extremely few customers for their products and services.  It is
hard to see how ANY businesses will be able to survive this compound
problem.<p>

The MAJORITY of American families have absolutely no idea how
to live today without being able to put a lot of debt into the distant
future on credit cards.  It is hard to see how long that learning
curve will take before they are again able to live within their
own means.  Considering that many millions will soon not have jobs
at all, their level of &quot;means&quot; figures to be very low
indeed.<p>

<hr>

During 2004, I told a number of people that I thought that in either
2008 or 2009, the Stock Market would drop to below 6,000.  Everyone
laughed at my ignorance!  When it passed 14,000 during 2008, I was
seen as an idiot.  I admit that it only dropped to around 8,000 during
2009, but I was fairly close!<p>

But this will get FAR worse!.  There is little doubt that by the
Summer of 2009, people will be TALKING about similarities to the Great
Depression of the 1930s.  But it seems likely that around then, millions of
people who lost their jobs will be defaulting on their credit card
payments, and VISA and MasterCard (and Banks) will get hurt to a level that
the current (2008) Wall Street crisis may seem minor!  Among other things,
all the people who now use credit cards to survive, may then be denied
that ability, but the government will likely need to print up
several trillion additional dollars to solve that problem.<p>

There will be so many problems which are EACH unimaginably huge,
that it is hard to see how even the US government will be able to
afford to throw enough money at all the problems to try to solve
them.  So I believe that by about 2011 or 2012, the entire financial
situation in the US may seem absolutely hopeless.  It seems certain
that the almighty dollar will necessarily be devaluated, maybe
to about half of its current value.  So IF any people actually
had any cash (or stocks), it would suddenly be worth half as much.<p>

It is hard to see how the situation in the US could significantly
improve even by 2020.  So the situation may be similar to but
even worse than the Great Depression.  One reason it seems likely
to be worse is that in the 1930s, there were only MEN competing for
the few (manual labor) jobs, where now the work force is nearly twice
as large because of the fact that women are also working.  And since
the US enthusiastically passed NAFTA and GATT in the early 1990s,
there are essentially NO high-paying manufacturing jobs still
remaining in the US.  Where will the jobs be, for possibly
50 million unemployed Americans who will all be on the verge
of starvation, without any home or apartment, and possibly even without
any motor vehicles?<p>

A really troubling aspect of this is the immense number of handguns
in the US, MORE than the number of people!  Say that YOUR family
scrimps and saves and you will actually be able to have enough
money to buy food to eat.  Your neighbors will all know that,
especially all of those who do not have jobs and do not have any
money or even an apartment.  But they will certainly have many handguns.
Doesn't it figure that at some point, they will figure it out?  That,
in total desperation and starvation, they will walk up to YOUR door
and demand your food and money.  They will get it.  The only real
question will be whether any of your family will still be alive.
And Police will be of no use, as EVERY community will have such events
happening every day, and there are not nearly enough Police even now.<p>

Even though the Global Warming catastrophe will certainly be far
worse, at least it figures to be a number of decades away, while these
economic problems seem likely to begin seriously in 2009 and CONTINUE
for at least ten years.  Sadly, everyone will become so focused on
economic problems that environmental issues may be neglected.  However,
BECAUSE of the extreme severity of the coming economic problems,
at least there can be a dark benefit that far fewer people will be
able to be using up gasoline and diesel and Jet-fuel in wasteful vehicles.<p>

Additional note of June 2009:  It is really troubling to me that
our leaders seem to often have incomplete logic behind their concepts!
An excellent example is the Chrysler bailout.  Rather than letting
Chrysler totally fail and it assets sold off to pay for some debts,
the Federal Government decided that would be too disruptive to the
weak economy, so they did some tricky things to supposedly enable
Chrysler to continue.  They got Fiat to agree to take over Chrysler's
operation by giving Fiat 6 billion dollars, and even then Fiat knew
that it was a bad idea!  Chrysler went into bankruptcy, which has
always taken at least five months in the Courts in the past, but through
some trickery, Chrysler was declared out of bankruptcy in a month!
That would be wonderful if that thinking was complete!  But it is not!<p>

The vehicles that Fiat makes in Italy cannot be sold in the US, due to
our many Federal Regulations.  Everyone agrees that it would be at least
TWO FULL YEARS before Fiat could ever start building (small) cars in the
US that could be sold here.  A recent news report announced that
Fiat/Chrysler would be able to START making economy cars around December
2011.  See the problem?  Our government rushed through Chrysler's
bankruptcy process, hurting some investors in the process, with the
apparent intention of getting Chrysler back into operation manufacturing
cars in the US, thereby re-employing all those thousands of workers who
lost their jobs in the Bankruptcy.  The PROBLEM is: So you put them
all back in the factories, but WHAT DO THEY BUILD?  The factories are NOT
set up to build the little Fiats which can be sold in Europe, so they
cannot do that.  For two years, they will not be able to even START
building the alleged future Chrysler cars which are tiny and efficient.

The ONLY vehicles that they are set up to build are essentially
OBSOLETE!  The giant gas-hogs which made most of Chrysler's profits
for many years, but which no one will now buy.  And if no one would
buy them before the Bankruptcy, even fewer would buy them from a
company that seemed clearly to simply be &quot;making work&quot;
for those thousands of workers!  So unless the Federal Government
is willing to buy decks of cards for all those thousands of alleged
Chrysler employees to occupy their time with for the next two years,
what else are they going to do?  And no one can expect Fiat to be
spending billions of dollars for that sort of activity, as they are
fully occupied in just making and selling their Fiats in Europe!<p>

How can anyone expect that Fiat will be willing to wait for more
than two years before re-activating the American factories?
How can anyone expect the American workers to wait for more than
two years to get jobs back in uncertain factories?  And why would
anyone believe that millions of customers would jump to buy totally
untested vehicles beyond two years from now, where much of any
profits that occurred would certainly go to Italy and Fiat Corporate?<p>

With such a poorly thought-through plan, Chrysler is certainly toast.
The American public is already upset in paying so many billions of
dollars to keep Chrysler and GM afloat so far, and that purse will
certainly soon dry up.  And leaders will then FINALLY face the
unavoidable fact that Chrysler assets will start getting hauled away
to Italy!  Those assets cannot then even be sold to try to pay off
any debts, since Fiat was given full control of them!<p>

<HR>

Another update, of November 2009:  Chrysler's problems are compounding,
where they announced that their sales dropped about 35% to 40%
last month.  The Chrysler Execs finally announced that they recognize
that no one wants to buy the giant gas-hogs they have still been
manufacturing, and they now intent to START planning to make smaller
cars within a few years.  Chrysler will never be around that long!
I am convinced that the really talented guy from Fiat will give up
on this experiment of trying to save Chrysler, maybe around February
1, 2010.  Whatever day he flies back to Italy, the next day, Chrysler
will disintegrate completely.<p>

But there is a FAR more important fact is recent news.  A year ago,
gold was selling for about $800 per ounce.  Yesterday, they announced
that it had exceeded $1500 per ounce.  No one seems willing to explain
to the public just what that means, and it is REALLY bad and REALLY
urgent.<p>

Gold does not actually increase or decrease in value very much, because
the world's supply of it is relatively constant.  When gold APPEARS
to double in cost in some type of currency, <b>the REALITY is that
THAT CURRENCY had DROPPED TO HALF ITS VALUE.</b><p>

Government and leaders do NOT want people to realize this fact.  If
and when the public realizes this, absolute financial anarchy seems
very likely.  Why?  Because, at some point, Geitner or Obama will have
to appear on National TV and announce that the (almighty) dollar is
being DEVALUED to maybe half its previous value.  At that moment,
your paycheck will remain as many DOLLARS as before, but it will
be able to BUY only half what it did yesterday.  If you think that
millions of people are NOW on the verge of bankruptcy and ruin, imagine
how much worse it will become that day when everyone's INCOME
suddenly only had half the remaining value.  STORES will immediately
double all prices of all products, in order to be as profitable and
stable as they were the day before.  But customers would now have to
pay $400 for groceries rather than $200 the day before.<p>

This means that SAVINGS, PENSIONS, etc, will suddenly have half the
worth as the day before.  Everyone will soon have to live day-to-day
in real-time, in order to get paid at the increasing rates that
will be necessary to keep up with the increasing prices of all needed
products.<p>

Imagine how many fur coats will then be sold?  Or luxury vacations on
yachts?  Or nearly anything beyond simply the needs of basic survival.<p>

How did this happen?  Well, historians will argue that for decades.
It probably was NECESSARY for Bush and Obama and their Administrations
to print trillions of dollars of new money to be able to give
astounding amounts of money to the banks to avoid the entire economy
falling off a cliff.  The leaders were all familiar with the Great
Depression of the 1930s and they felt it necessary to try to do those
things to avoid repeating the Great Depression.  In that, they seemed
to succeed.  However, the fact that they had to print up all that
extra paper money, while the actual total value of all money was
certainly not increasing at all, and it might have decreased, set
in motion the process toward devaluation of the dollar.<p>

The leaders all HOPED that the consequences would not occur.
The assumptions were that if they could get all markets to become
really profitable, then there would become widespread prosperity and
everyone would be happy and secure.  There seems that there was
a horrible flaw in that logic, in not seriously considering the
alternatives.  Personally, I have a suspicion that it MIGHT have
actually been BETTER in the long run if they had simply stood back
and LET the banks fail and the American economic system fall into a
deep Depression, probably even worse than that in the 1930s.<p>

Because what figures to happen now seems certain to be far worse.
The wild and rapid increases in the value of gold, seems CERTAIN to
force the hand of American government leadership, specifically
Geitner and Obama, to greatly devaluate the dollar.  This has NEVER
happened before to America!  But when it has happened to other countries,
it has often led to a downward spiral that is self-perpetuating.
Which suggests that further devaluations will then occur.  One really
bad part of this is that it can happen VERY fast.  In just months,
gasoline might be $100 per gallon or more.  A loaf of bread might be
$5 or $20 or more.  And NO ONE will be immune from the effects.<p>

Anyone who DID own any assets or money, would/will use it all up
rather fast.  And since there will be few customers for any products,
how many businesses could survive?  Meaning, how many jobs?<p>

One of the reasons for the downward spiral is that governments tend
to start printing more and more money, to try to give out enough for
people to be happy with.  But the printing of trillions of dollars
of extra money merely causes more devaluation in its value, and nothing
actually changes.<p>

The US government will certainly TRY to keep increasing Social
Security payments and Food Stamps, and making sure that military and
police are paid.  But that is likely to only be temporary solutions.<p>

When we did not go off a cliff at the end of 2008, by very creative
ideas, the long term effect might have been that we will soon face
a far taller cliff which we WILL fall off of.  And the sorts of desperate
measures that are generally applied in trying to reduce the bad effects,
virtually always actually have the effect of making the cliff taller.<p>

Until this recent gold news, I thought it would be around 2012 or 2013
before we got to the very darkest part of the economic catastrophe that
we are now in.  I now wonder if that cliff might be just a month or two
away, near the very start of 2010.  And it is really hard to see how
anyone will be able to survive very well, and certainly NO ONE will
prosper.<p>

I feel the need for an addition to these dark comments early in 2016.
Saudi Arabia leaders do NOT want 28 pages of the 2001 attack documents to
get released, because they apparently show that Saudi Royal Family members
were somehow involved in the 9/11/01 attacks, possibly due to financially
supporting the terrorists then.  NOW, with the threat that the US
government is talking about RELEASING those 28 pages of old files, the
Saudi government has threatened the US with their intention of SELLING
everything they own in the US.  It's around a total of $750 billion
dollars, mostly of Real Estate and Financial documents.  This WILL be
horrific if they actually SELL all that stuff!  Why?  Because the ACTUAL
TOTAL AMOUNT OF ACTUAL REAL US MONEY is only around $260 billion dollars.
Yes, TOTAL DEBTS in the US are around $60 trillion dollars, but the
problem is that virtually all of that is based on &quot;imaginary money&quot;, that 
is money that had simply been PRINTED UP without anything REAL behind it.
Long ago, we had a &quot;gold economy&quot; where all paper money was ACTUALLY BASED
on REAL GOLD, stored in Fort Knox and elsewhere.  Paper money was then
called SILVER CERTIFICATES which meant that anyone could &quot;cash it in for
real silver&quot; of that exact value.  Paper money stopped saying that
&quot;Silver Certificate&quot; statement, and in recent decades, there is really
very little REAL assets which stand behind the astounding amounts of
paper money we throw around and the $60 trillion dollars of LOAN documents.
Fortunately, virtually NO ONE is aware of this really scary situation.
IF ANYTHING happens where the United States has to TRY to back up EVEN
ONE TRILLION DOLLARS of all that &quot;paper&quot; we WILL be in very sudden,
desperate trouble.  There are quite a few countries which currently
HOLD enormous amounts of US paper.  China is the largest, with their
$1.8 trillion or so (much from all the WalMart products we have all
bought which had been manufactured in China).  But China is smart enough
to NOT cause our American monetary system to collapse, so they know better
than to try to sell too much of American assets (for cash) too fast.
However, Saudi Arabia and their $750 billion of American assets COULD
tear the wheels off the American economy, as soon as they try to
sell even just $250 billion of them, as that would suck up ALL THE CASH
which EXISTS in AMERICA!  On THAT DAY, all 330 million Americans will
find that NOTHING that they consider to be &quot;assets&quot; can be sold for cash!
ATM machines will no longer be able to disburse ANY cash, maybe ever again!
Banks themselves may likely ALL close because they will have NO actual
money that they could dispense to Savings Account Holders or anyone with any
Real Estate holdings that they want to get a loan on.  In principle, this
could all happen IN ONE DAY, although most people will not really grasp
the true catastrophe in it.  But as soon as people realize that they
CANNOT get ANY cash, imagine the effect on those people and governments
which THINK they hold that $60 trillion dollars!  NONE of that is REAL!<p>

As long as NO ONE KNOWS, everyone just bops along with smiles on their
faces, because they BELIEVE they have assets of millions of dollars.
In 1929, many people in the Stock Market jumped out of windows when they
(suddenly) realized that the enormous wealth they THOUGHT they owned,
did not actually exist!  This current situation will be FAR worse than
that!  Rich people today know these things and the moment they realize
that catastrophe was coming, they WILL try to WITHDRAW as much of that
ACTUALA $250 billion as they can (to send it to some Island bank for their
personal account).  So even the Saudis probably will not actually be
able to SELL very much of their $750 billion of assets.  And once all
banks and all credit cards no longer work, immense numbers of people,
in the US and around the world, will suddenly discover that they can
no longer buy food for their families, no matter WHAT a Bank Statement
might say.  Wow!<p>

Sorry for the darkness of these comments, but these are not really
OPINIONS but nearly certainly COMING FACTS.  I actually truly hope that
I am totally wrong about these things!  But I had wished that I would
be wrong about the economic/Wall Street things as well, and those
things seemed to have occurred, even more worse than I had expected.<p>

This Domain contains an assortment of fairly simple devices which YOU
might make:
<ul>
<li> to eliminate using fossil fuels to heat your home and also
save that $2,000 each winter that you might be spending in that way;
<li> to eliminate the big electric bills in the summer for air conditioning;
<li> to provide refrigeration and freezing for food preservation and
storage, without significant electric bills;
<li> to provide reasonable amounts of electricity from several different
possible sources;
<li> to provide perfectly safe drinking water that is actually removed
from the humidity in the air!;
<li> to heat domestic hot water, without fossil fuels and nearly for free;
<li> to possibly improve the food production of greenhouse fruits and
vegetables by a factor of five, with even better taste!;
<li> if there is some business-person or bank in your (rural) community
that has around $1.8 million to invest, your community could create
at least a hundred good-paying LOCAL jobs and also have a LOCAL source
of large amounts of wind-generated electricity, and the cost to
the business-person and bank would be quickly paid back by selling the
electricity AND through government Tax Credits, where the whole system
would essentially become free within around two to three years!
<li> and assorted other things that MIGHT become really crucial if the

<a name="4"><font size='+2'><b>Regarding My Concept for Ending the War(s) in Iraq</b></font></a><br><br>

<b>Observation:</b> These first subjects, regarding Global Warming
and ending the Iraq War, seem to me to be incredibly important. Even
if my comments contain flaws, I would like to think that they should
be at least considered, specifically because no one else seems to have
come up with any credible solutions to these two enormous problems.
So, after I developed the Iraq solution in October 2006, I mailed out
around 70 letters and e-mailed around 340 notes, to a wide range of
public figures. To government and political leaders, to many networks,
specific programs that have discussed the problems in Iraq, to thirty
two Political Science Professors in major Universities, to many newspapers,
even to reporters and others actually in Iraq. Doesn't it seem that
some of those people should have had at least some initial interest
in a new idea?  Even if it were only regarding how and why a Christian
Church Pastor was trying to save large numbers of Muslims from dying
in a civil war?  I have been extremely surprised that in over eleven
months, I have received a grand total of TWO responses from those
410 contacts!  One was from a Poli Sci Prof who berated me for wasting
my and her time. The other was in December 2006 from a reporter in Baghdad
who responded that he was VERY interested in hearing any new idea. (But he
never again responded to the added information!) I rarely mind
being told that my ideas are without value, so even if he (or any of the
400 others) thought that the idea was stupid and a waste of time, I would
have thought that I should have received a polite rejection???<p>

Each person is free to make their own decisions in life. But I have
to wonder about the Poli Sci Profs. They ARE knowledgeable in world
conflicts, since that is what they Teach about!  One would assume that
they CARE about their subject, but that appears to have been an
incorrect assumption! But further, I would have thought that those
32 Professors would have had a SELFISH reason for wanting to possibly
promote this concept. There are almost one hundred thousand Political
Science instructors in the US.  Few of them ever become noted for anything!
But I had thought that at least ONE of those 32 Professors would have
seen an OPPORTUNITY for him/her, in that how many Poli Sci Profs
ever even TRY to end a major war? Even if the concept turned out
not to work, I had thought that a Professor who chose to alert
others in Poli Sci about &quot;a possible way to end the war in
Iraq.&quot; would likely have gained massive respect and reputation
among colleagues!  Like, regarding future EMPLOYMENT possibilities???
And I had NOT expected any of them to commit years of their life to
developing a concept, but merely maybe an hour or two to see if
there might be any positive feedback. Sure, if all the feedback was
negative, he/she would have wasted an hour of valuable time!<p>

Do our leaders actually CARE about solving these things? I am not
insisting that I have any brilliant ideas, but only that leaders should
be willing to at least CONSIDER ideas other than their own!  Says
something about trying to do Christian Good Deeds, doesn't it?<p>

In any case, it looks like the leaders and politicians insist on
forging ahead with their own assumptions that massive amounts of money
is the ONLY solution to all problems! That is even sadder, that they
have such narrow perspectives! Either brute force (Iraq, Afghanistan,
North Korea, Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, etc) or massive amounts of
American taxpayer money is always the only solution to all problems!
Spock would say &quot;Interesting!&quot;<p>

<HR>

In Oct. 2006, I started trying to get authorities to consider
a very unique concept toward ending the war in Iraq, specifically ending
the sectarian violence between Shia and Sunni Muslims.  I first tried
to let Colin Powell be able to get credit for it, but there was no
response from several letters and dozens of e-mails.  I then tried
to let around 40 other American leaders know about it, starting with
the people who were part of the Iraq Study Council, James Baker and
Lee Hamilton and others.  No responses from anyone.  I then sent
preliminary descriptions to 32 Professors of Political Science
at major Universities, including DePaul, Purdue (main campus), Purdue
North Central Campus, Purdue Calumet Campus, University of Chicago,
Governors State College, Prairie State College, South Suburban
College and others.  In one phone call to SSC, the (woman) Professor
was incredibly disrespectful, even telling me that she was really
busy and that she should have ended the call five minutes earlier,
as she hung up on me.  I have always wondered what immensely important
duties she has that are more important than avoiding the deaths of
1,500 additional American troops since then, along with around 100,000
Iraqi people!  It must be great to be so important that you can
blow off a Minister who is trying to save thousands of human lives!<p>

Only one even sent an e-mail back, and that was
to tell me to stop wasting my time!  I tried assorted newspapers and
TV networks and TV programs such as Meet The Press, the Charlie Rose
Show, Think Tank, McLaughlin Group, the PBS News Hour, Nightline and
others, with no responses at all except for a couple automated responses.
I tried to contact Tom Friedman in several ways.
I then tried to contact all the news reporters I could in Iraq, such
as John Burns, Sabrina Tavernise, Bobby Ghosh, Richard Engel,
Dexter Filkins, George Packer, and many others.  No responses.
I even tried contacting an assortment of Arabic newspapers and
television media such as al Jazeera.  No responses.<p>

<b>I am tempted to wonder if no one really cares!  Or if no one really
wants to stop that war.</b>  Or that there is some immense confidence
that the leaders suddenly know what they are doing!  In any case,
after six months of really serious effort to get ANYONE to simply
listen to the concept, with zero interest after hundreds of e-mails
and dozens of letters, I really do not know what else to try.  The only
remaining thought I had was to hire someone to translate it into
Arabic and then submit it again to Arabic newspapers and television.<p>

I had really figured that at least a few people would have responded,
if only to tell me that it is a dumb idea!  But no one ever even
had enough interest to learn what the actual concept was, to form such
an opinion!  These days, people are all so BUSY that they are only willing
to waste 10 seconds in reading the first sentence of any communication they
get, upon which they then believe they TOTALLY UNDERSTAND every nuance
of any subject, and to also find the correspondence to have wasted their
time!  Very strange!  I will always believe that it was Iraq's
one true chance at avoiding an incredibly bloody massive civil war,
which will certainly involve Muslims around the world.<p>

<a name="3"><font size='+2'><b>Global Warming Issues</b></font></a><br><br>

There actually seems a credible possibility that the devices that ANYONE
can build [to heat their homes and make their hot water] can have a
huge effect at correcting the Global Warming problem.  Yet, of around
185 attempts made so far to let news organizations, the British government,
and many others know about this (nearly all by e-mail, so far), ZERO
responses!<p>

Do our leaders actually CARE about solving these things?  I am not
insisting that I have any brilliant ideas, but only that leaders should
be willing to at least CONSIDER ideas other than their own!  Some friends
have told me that the fact that I am giving away the construction plans
to the two devices causes people to assume that they have no value!
I suppose that might be true, which is really sad.  Says something about
trying to do Christian Good Deeds, doesn't it?<p>

In any case, it looks like the leaders and politicians insist on

<a name="6"><font size='+2'><b>Capture, Killing of Zarqawi</b></font></a><br><br>

The US Government had insisted on capturing or killing Osama bin Laden
and Zarqawi almost immediately after 9/11/01, and they soon offered
a $25,000,000 reward for anyone who enabled them to find either one
of them.  For four years, they had ZERO success, and rarely seemed to even
have much of an idea of what REGION either of them were in!<p>

I have no doubt that I deserve to receive the $25MM for Zarqawi!<p>

On <b>Apr. 25, 2006</b>, I sent the following e-mail to half a dozen
National News media organizations, including Charlie Rose, ABC Nightline,
Think Tank, Foreign Exchange, Meet the Press:<p>

<PRE>
Hi,

<b>The video of Zarqawi today may have extremely important evidence in it!</b>
For the past two years, I have been trying to get word to the CIA regarding
this regarding the many outdoor videos of bin Laden.  I know that you have
contact with people high in the CIA, so I ask that you inform them of the
following.

Around two years ago, our Intelligence demonstrated a &quot;face recognition
system&quot; at the Super Bowl game.  Each face scanned was quickly compared to
images of many terrorists and criminals.  I don't think the success of that
demonstration was ever presented, but the basic concept is what I see of
value.

I have recommended that UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) be flown at low
altitude up and down every valley of Afghanistan, with (two) side directed
cameras taking an image every second.  The result would be &quot;a database of
background images from every location&quot; (with around 150 feet spacing between
images, if the images are taken once per second and the aircraft flown at
100 mph).  Now that Zarqawi made a similar video (probably in Iraq), I
recommend the same be done there.

<b>The existing &quot;face recognition program software&quot; could then be
used WITHOUT MODIFICATION.</b>  Instead of hundreds of thousands of photos
of faces, the database would be filled with hundreds of thousands of
these UAV photos of backgrounds.  Then a frame of a bin Laden or Zarqawi
video could be entered as the &quot;suspect face&quot;, to be compared with
all the hundreds of thousands of background images in the database.
The existing system should then be able to identify a &quot;few&quot;
reasonably possible locations which could have been the background of
Zarqawi.  <b>Within seconds, our Intelligence could know EXACTLY where Zarqawi
was on last Friday when he allegedly made that video!</b>  In any case, such
&quot;evidence&quot; seems extremely valuable to me!  I have never gotten any response
in any previous attempts to apprise our Intelligence regarding this concept.
I truly believe they might then capture or kill Zarqawi and/or bin Laden
within days!

I was educated as a Nuclear Physicist at the University of Chicago, so I
like to think that I have some idea regarding this working as described!

So I hope you will try to pass word along for me, and for our country's
security.

<b>Forty-two days later, they found Zarqawi and killed him.</b>
<font color="#cc7777"><b>The news
reports in the first few hours (as on BBC) described that they had
analyzed the videotape and figured out where he was, and they announced
that that was how they got him.</b></font>  However, just hours later,
they were announcing a very different story, where some local
people had turned him in.<p>

I can understand why they would have done that.  They would clearly want
to be able to use the same method in finding Usama bin Laden from
the videotapes that he would regularly make outdoors.  Obviously,
they would not want UBL to know that it was a bad idea to do any
more outdoor videotapes.  So I understand that that would have wanted
the news media to present a different story.<p>

<b>Still, they had chased Zarqawi for more than four years without finding
him.  Then I provide my method and 42 days later, Zarqawi is dead,
and the initial news reports described essentially my exact concept!</b>
<b>It seems to me that I deserve the $25 million reward that the US
government offered for information toward the capture or killing of
Zarqawi!</b> Some how, I don't think I will ever be given MY MONEY!<p>

<HR>

Actually, I think I could have qualified for the similar reward regarding
bid Laden several years earlier.  In late 2002, the US Military believed
that bid Laden and many other al Qaeda leaders were living in a very deep
cave inside some mountains in a very rugged area which separates
Afghanistan and Pakistan.  My friend Peter Jennings (of ABC News) had aired
news reports where it was believed that they were living around 1500 feet
deep underground.  The US plans were to use many of their ferociously
powerful bunker-buster bombs to demolish the entire mountain!<p>

I (and probably many others) found that to be a truly foolish approach.
It was pure Military thinking, and would certainly have resulted
in the killing of thousands of nearby civilians by giant flying
rocks, parts of the mountain that were blown away!<p>

So I described a far more logical approach to Peter Jennings.  I pointed out
that people living inside a cave NEEDED AIR TO BREATHE.  I mentioned that
caves generally tended to only have a very few internal passageways
where air could get into the cave system.  I pointed out that the US Military
certainly has extremely sensitive infrared imaging equipment which
could have monitored the vicinity of the mountain.<p>

Finding where DISCARDED air left the cave system would have been
very easy, as that air would have become slightly WARMED from the
98.6&#176;F exhaled breaths of all the people living inside.  Such outlets
would likely be high on the mountain, as such warmed air tends to rise,
even inside caves.  (It is a scientific process called thermosiphoning.)
However, I felt that the value of finding where
air was LEAVING the mountain was of limited value.  Yes, small bombs
could cause such outlets to become sealed shut, but a large mountain
could contain a lot of air, and even without circulation, people might
be able to live a year on the remaining air supply inside a large mountain.<p>

But the valuable part of what I described to Mr. Jennings was that
there had to be INTAKES of air into the cave system!  They would
certainly be LOW on the mountain or even slightly away from the
mountain.  Again, infrared imaging, as well as precision radar, could
detect MOTION patterns of airflows in the area.  Good Technicians
should be able to use computers to discover statistical patterns in
those airflows, to (quickly) discover WHERE they were.<p>

I noted to Peter that such INTAKES represented critical air supplies
for any residents INSIDE the mountain.  I then mentioned to him two
different approaches.  The less desirable one was to use small bombs to
seal off those air intakes, but again, that could leave large amounts
of air already inside the mountain, for months of survival.  I then
suggested to Peter that if deadly airborne poisons were simply airdropped
near the entrances of such airpaths, within HOURS, the entire cave
system inside the mountain would be filled with such poisonous gases.
If the poison chosen was not obvious by smell or appearance,
it seemed certain to me that within a day or two, anything living
INSIDE the caves would have died!<p>

As generally was true, Mr. Jennings was extremely attentive to my
suggestions.  His position as a world-famous Journalist gave him
easy access to the ears of virtually everyone in power!  And he
later informed me that he had called a couple Generals in the
Pentagon (without identifying them to me) to describe my approach.<p>

Peter later seemed surprised that they did not seem to ever try my
concept.  It certainly was far simpler than what they had decided
to try to do (bomb the entire mountain to oblivion!), a lot quicker,
and a lot cheaper to do!<p>

I realize that my concept was fairly complex in some of its details,
and maybe Peter was not able to get the Generals to fully grasp
the concept or its premise.  But I still see that as a far more
likely successful way of eliminating bin Laden back in 2002!  But,
like with Zarqawi four years later, I have a feeling that I would
never have been given the $25 million reward!  Of course, the fact
that Peter Jennings was fully aware of my sourcing that concept, and that
HE was the method where the Military first learned about it, I want
to believe that my friend Peter would have stood up for my case,
and somehow gotten the Pentagon to &quot;quietly&quot; gotten the
reward to me!  But there seemed no indication that any Military
effort along these lines was ever tried, or if they were, no news of
them ever leaked out.  In any case, bin Laden was apparently not killed
in that mountain, and so I guess I didn't deserve any reward then
anyway!  But, still, it sure seemed to me (and to Peter) that my
approach made a lot of logical sense!<p>

<a name="8"><font size='+2'><b>To FIX the Stock Market!</b></font></a><br><br>

<b>The US Congress would simply pass a Law where NO Trader or Mutual
Fund would be permitted to BUY OR SELL more than 1% of their holdings
of any specific company on any one day!</b>  Period!  That would
instantly and completely eliminate the wild speculation on
stock price changes and would re-install the original intent of the
Stock Markets as being a source of financing of businesses.<p>

OK.  As a Physicist, this would seem out of my bailiwick.  But Physicists
are VERY logical people, and I believe I see TWO things that should
IMMEDIATELY (Oct 2008) be done!  Of course, no one of actual importance
will ever read this, so my thoughts on this really do not matter,
do they?  And you are free to agree or disagree with the following,
but I do NOT intend to be &quot;debating&quot; this matter with
thousands of people who each feel they have even better ideas!<p>

First, we must note that the ORIGINAL intent of the Stock Market was
to provide a constant supply of money that is needed to support
the many businesses which need it to operate.  Fine.  It provided
the money for companies to use to start and build their businesses.<p>

And as long as stock market transactions were SLOW, it seemed to work
pretty well.  Millions of INDIVIDUAL stockholders may or may not
decide to buy or sell stock on a particular day, and CHANGES in the
overall RATING (value) of any one company would or could rarely change
by more than 1% in a week or a month.  Fine.<p>

But the PURPOSE of the Stock Market greatly changed, primarily about
30 years ago.  It became a GAMBLING GAME for a very small number of
people.  Unfortunately, it was and is not an entirely FAIR gambling
game, as those same people have the capability of MANIPULATING the
market to their own PERSONAL ends.<p>

The well-being of a company is no longer of any importance at all!
And the value that a stock trades at has often changed at fantastic
speeds, where the (alleged) total value of a company sometimes DOUBLES
in a single day, or HALVES!  This has NOTHING to do with the actual
company, and rarely has much to do with the company's sales or success.
A simple RUMOR which is good or bad can cause EVERYONE to suddenly
want to either buy or sell the stock of that company, and there is
NO importance any more of whether the rumor was even true!<p>

An example seems appropriate, which has been repeated EVERY DAY for many
years!  A stock is described as having a particular value, say $10
per share, at the start of a trading day.  One of those few powerful
people (who have access to massive money or credit) decides that
he thinks he can make some money on the stock of that
company.  So he BUYS UP maybe 100,000,000 shares of that company, maybe
in a quick series of purchases.  ALL THE OTHER TRADERS AND INVESTORS SEE
the enormous traffic in the stock of that company AND that the stock
price is rapidly going up.  So THEY want to buy in (with the intent
of also getting very rich very fast).  And everyone then sees that the
traffic in that stock is growing even faster and the prices are shooting
up even faster.  So, maybe by the end of the SAME DAY, the price of a
share of that company's stock has risen spectacularly to maybe $20.<p>

And at THIS point, the person who STARTED this whole thing decides to
SELL those 100 million shares he bought that same morning.  But now he
can SELL them at $20 per share when he had bought them that same morning for
$10 per share.  In this single company's stock, in a single day, he
first SPENT one billion to buy the stock, but then RECEIVED TWO billion
later that same day!  <b>In a single day, with a single stock, he
has just made a personal profit of one billion dollars!</b><p>

And he is proud of himself for having accomplished something!<p>

But what did he actually accomplish?  After he sells all his
stocks, everyone else will see the massive selling (which is NEVER
identified as being from ONE seller or a million sellers, which is
incredibly useful in this situation for them!) and they will also
sell.  And the amount they could sell for will drop rapidly, possibly
back to the original $10 per share.<p>

Did the COMPANY benefit at all from this?  No, because their total
value of all their stock did not change after the whole day was done.<p>

The Trader made his billion dollars.  Where did that money come from?
Was it printed up just to give to him?  No.  It actually came from
the LOSSES of exactly one billion dollars by OTHER INVESTORS and TRADERS!
Those are the large numbers of people who got in late, and had to buy that
stock for $18 or $20 per share, but then quickly discovered that the
price soon plummeted and they had to TRY to sell it for $14 or $12 or
$10 per share, thereby losing money on EVERY share of it.  EACH of them
might have only owned a few hundred or few thousand shares, so their
INDIVIDUAL losses might have been moderate.  But COLLECTIVELY, they
necessarily lost that billion dollars that day!<p>

IF there was any sort of MEDIA REPORT which indicated that that particular
company was ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE a cure for cancer or some super-efficient
vehicle, it even gives the people who dream up such schemes a sort of
CREDIBILITY upon which the herd of later investors would enthusiastically
jump!  And they KNOW that!  In some cases, the Traders KNEW some
such fact BEFORE it was otherwise known, but that sort of Insider Trading
was made illegal when a lot of them were cheating other investors
in such ways.  But it still happens every day, but the Traders are just far
more cautious now to make sure not to leave any evidence that they had
previously known of what was about to happen or be said.  The entire
process has evolved a lot, to a point where actual Inside Information
(for which they could be sent to prison) is generally no longer even
necessary, and simply a RUMOR is all that is needed to enable
doing this.  And they know that they could NEVER be sent to prison
for acting on a rumor!<p>

They DON'T call that cheating each other, and essentially they ALL
need to do such things just to be competitive with all the others
who do it.  And so there has developed an astounding tunnel-vision
regarding ONLY looking for HUGE PROFITS TODAY, where no other considerations
matter.  Such as the effects on the company whose stocks are used
for such trickery.<p>

Actually, this sort of manipulation of the value of a stock was
openly done and very common in the 1920s, and it was a direct
cause of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the following
Great Depression. So Laws were passed to make such behaviors illegal.
The problem is that top Executives in Wall Street are very smart, and
they have found several ways to EFFECTIVELY do the same today but
without any evidence that they have done anything wrong. They see
nothing wrong in using such methods, which are known to have been
the direct cause of the Great Depression, as long as they believe
they cannot get caught!<p>

There is a slightly more legal variant of this, which is definitely
used by every Trader, every day!  Say that we see a Stock that is
currently $10.00.  And a Trader FEELS LIKE GAMBLING!  He THINKS that
stock will rise by 1%, up to $10.10 that day.  So he buys the
100 million shares.  It turns out that IF HE WAS RIGHT IN HIS GAMBLE,
and he would sell all those shares at the end of the day, he would
&quot;earn&quot; ten cents on each of those shares, or $10 million
on that single stock in that single day.  AND, of course, he knows
that the EFFECT of his buying all that stock will be seen by all
other traders and investors, which NEARLY GUARANTEES that his
&quot;gamble&quot; will turn out to be true, and not actually
much of a gamble at all!<p>

This IS what the modern Stock Market is!  It has virtually NOTHING
to do with the initial reasons for stock markets!  It is simply
a giant game of Monopoly, where if you are big enough and have access
to enough money, you can CAUSE self-perpetuating profits for yourself
(but at the cost of the exact same amount of losses by other investors!)<p>

The Stock Market is obviously a lot more complex than this simplified
description, but the core of its operation is essentially as described
here.  MOST stocks are now bought and sold by DAY TRADERS, people who
ONLY intend to own any particular stock for a very brief time.
MUTUAL FUNDS have made this even worse, as the few individuals who
operate such funds can buy and sell billions of dollars of stocks
every day, and they do.<p>

A significant point to be made here is that REALITY has very little
place in this whole operation!  The ACTUAL value of all the assets
of General Motors is irrelevant!  It is ONLY what the few handfuls
of individuals who can buy and sell billions of dollars of stocks
believe that matters!  And, because of the rather incestuous
arrangement, those people tend to follow each other's movements
with similar movements of their own, because they do NOT want to be
found to be the person who moved too slow and therefore caused his
Fund to be left out of great profits.<p>

Another amazing factor is an absolute lack of transparency.  Absolutely
no one seems to know WHO is buying or selling or HOW MUCH or even
whether they actually have the funds to back such purchases!  In fact,
there have been MANY times when Traders officially BOUGHT massive
amounts of stock when they did not have the available money to do so,
ASSUMING that they would again sell it all within a few hours,
at the expected profit, in order to provide the money that SHOULD
HAVE EXISTED in order to even start the whole thing!  There is a LOT
of this sort of trickery which occurs every day related to the
Stock Market, but since NO ONE EVER IS ABLE TO KNOW (due to the
lack of transparency), they are all able to get away with such things!
It is truly unbelievable that it can work at all!  It is virtually
ONLY a gambling game between a very small numbers of heavy hitters!<p>

For at least five years, I have speculated about an even darker
possibility that I see possible.  I usually describe it about like this:
Imagine that you have a roomful of people who all agree that the
HEALTH of the stock market is critically important to their individual
successes and wealth.  Under NO conditions, could they ALLOW any really
bad things to ever occur.  These people would be those couple dozen
people who each have the capability of buying or selling billions
of dollars of stock at any personal whim.<p>

So they see that some important stock seems to be dropping in price.
One or more of them immediately offers to buy a billion dollars of that
stock.  Since all investors and Traders would immediately see that huge
purchase, any public sense of panic would vanish, and PROBABLY millions
of private investors might each then decide to buy a little bit, where the
person would then be able to sell off the billion dollars of stocks,
smoothly and INVISIBLY.<p>

I often felt that such an incestuous relationship was the ONLY
explanation for days when there was horrendous business news, but then
the Stock Market shot UP by 400 points!  Such things should NOT be
possible!  I remember one day a year or two ago when Ford announced
a tremendous loss of billions of dollars, the unemployment figure had
greatly risen, and two other pieces of major negative business news
occurred, and yet the Stock Market shot up that day!  I tend to think
that COULD NOT have happened without some sort of collusion like what
I had speculated.  Of course, since there is no transparency, there could
never have been any way to prove that my suspicions might have been true!<p>

<h3>The Solution</h3>

With the preamble above, we can now consider the suggestion.  Is it to
give $110 billion to AIG, which they immediately put to use in sending
themselves on a luxury holiday?  No.  Does it involve ANY US Taxpayer
money?  No.  It is even quite simple to do!  <b>The US Congress would
simply pass a Law where NO Trader or Mutual Fund would be permitted
to BUY OR SELL more than 1% of their holdings on any one day!</b>  Period!<p>

That would ELIMINATE much of the INCENTIVE of the Brokers to be
Day Trading to swipe some quick millions of dollars, because they would
NOT be allowed to be buying or selling that large a fraction of their
holdings ON ANY SINGLE DAY.  <b>It would inspire and require LONGER-TERM
PLANNING on the part of Traders and Investors, getting back to the
INITIAL REASON for the Stock Market to exist.</b><p>

This is in total contrast to the current approaches of Washington,
of PROVIDING hundreds of billions of (taxpayer) dollars to allegedly
stabilize Wall Street.  Washington can't seem to realize that by
ENSURING plenty of money, with the current rules, it ENCOURAGES
every Trader to make his best guess as to WHEN he should
&quot;buy absolutely everything!&quot;  Given the depressed level
that they all believe the Market is now in, they each see an OBVIOUS
way that they can make THEMSELVES many billions of dollars, by
buying enormous amounts of stock when it is low and then selling it
ALL a few days later.  Why doesn't Washington see that they will be
FEEDING such greedy people?  That some of our taxpayer billions will
DIRECTLY go into billions of personal profits, leaving the Market
no better than before?  And it is ALL because the Traders are ALLOWED
to make fantastically huge purchases and sales of stocks every few
minutes!<p>

The <b>ONE PERCENT PER DAY rule</b> would also eliminate the tremendous
surges and then personal incentives
of Traders to be buying and selling obscene amounts of stock, just
to be running with the herd!  <b>The Stock Market would NECESSARILY
be based more on sanity, as it should be!</b>  The ACTUAL VALUE
of the total assets (minus liabilities) of any company would be
carefully examined before making any major stock commitment in that
company.<p>

<b>As long as Traders can expect to be able to make billions of
dollars in what they call daily &quot;profit taking&quot;, nothing
will really change!</b>  It would not matter much what the
government might try to invoke, human nature would find a way
to bypass it, because they can taste those enormous profits!<p>

This simple concept would FORCE all investors and Traders to essentially
adopt Warren Buffet's LONG view of the Stock Market.  Of ONLY buying
when there was ACTUAL perceived value existing, and no longer
running thither and yon in buying and selling stocks as if they were
simply scoring markers in a game of Monopoly!<p>

I actually have a SECOND recommendation as well!  I believe that if
my friend Peter Jennings was still with us, he would have instituted
the following, so if it should ever be adopted, my hope would be that
it be called the Jennings approach!<p>

I believe that Peter would have invited: Warren Buffett, Bill Gates,
Melissa Gates, President Sarcozy of France, Tony Blair, Robert Redford,
Charlie Rose, Michael Jordan, Will Smith,
Richard Petty, Bono, President da Silva
of Brazil, at least one prominent Japanese and two prominent Chinese and
two prominent Indian, and a few others; to a regular meeting in a remote
location such as Mr. Redford's Ranch.  There, with NO ONE ELSE than them
present, they would have free-wheeling discussions about ALL matters
that are critical to the world's people.  NO politicians are in that mix
(but Jimmy Carter seems a possible exception to that), and no bureaucrats.<p>

The point would be that they would bring up all kinds of ideas and probably
immediately shoot them down.  And occasionally, if they felt they needed
&quot;expert advice&quot; regarding the Economy or Nuclear Power or Global
Warming or anything else, THEY could decide to invite SEVERAL experts
in the appropriate fields (for only one day) where they would then
be able to ask their questions.  Several so that they could hear
differing views on any specific issue.<p>

The theory would be that they would FIND A CONSENSUS regarding what
should be said or done.  And THEN, EACH of them would return to
their normal life and start to have Press Conferences, where they
EXPLAIN TO THE PUBLIC WHY they feel confident that the solution they
have adopted seems to make sense.  A member of the public would
therefore see Bono on TV describing the EXACT same plan that Tony Blair
similarly presented, which is identical to the plan that Michael
Jordan and Bill Gates would be saying.<p>

The POINT of this is that THE PUBLIC would very quickly see that
MANY of the famous people THAT THEY RESPECT all seem to be in
complete agreement about what is needed to be done.<p>

This is actually a modern version of what Franklin Roosevelt had
done to INSPIRE CONFIDENCE in the American people in 1933.  The
people's lives had actually not materially improved, but they all
FELT confident that FDR &quot;knew how to lead them back to
prosperity and happiness&quot;.  (As it turned out, FDR made many
bad decisions regarding things to try, but as long as the people
BELIEVED in his leadership, they were all confident that the US
would recover.)<p>

So the final aspect of this suggestion is that the group of 20 people
probably would KNOW when they needed to get together.  If Peter
Jennings was still with us, he certainly would have known, and he
would certainly have simply called each of them and asked them if their
schedules could include a Meeting for a few days at XX/XX/XX to XX/XX/XX.
But it seems good that if the PUBLIC saw need for them to meet, THEY
could somehow initiate the process for them as well!<p>

PEOPLE would feel INVOLVED.  They would feel CONFIDENT.  And they
would TRUST those people who they had earlier learned to have great
respect for.<p>

<a name="9"><font size='+2'><b>To FIX the American Economy!</b></font></a><br><br>

America faces enormous problems ahead.  It is NOT just that
millions of houses are worth less than people owe on them,
in other words, they have no equity in the house they live in,
or that they also rarely have any savings, or that their 401-k
and other retirement plans have lost trillions of dollars due to
problems in the stock market.<p>

A CENTRAL problem in coming years will be there will be few JOBS
for the many millions of people who are out of work.  A similar
situation occurred during the 1930s, but it was actually BETTER
then because there were millions of MANUFACTURING jobs in the US
then.  Now, there are not, because the NAFTA and GATT agreements
had enabled and encouraged nearly all manufacturers to move
their factories to countries where workers are ENTHUSIASTIC
at working for 50 cents per hour, instead of American workers who
were generally unhappy at being paid $30/hour for the same work.<p>

A complicating factor is that, because BOTH men and women now work,
there are essentially twice as many American people who will be
searching for the few jobs which will be available.  An interesting
aspect of this is that it figures that there will be soon millions
of workers who WILL BE WILLING to work for BELOW minimum wage,
out of desperation to earn enough for food for their family!
How will employers deal with that, as they will get into deep trouble
if they ever pay any employee less than Minimum Wage!<p>

In any case, I believe there is a really obvious AND WONDERFUL
solution for much of this!<p>

In the 1930s, FDR set up many work programs, where millions of
people earned money (from the government) for manual labor,
in building the road system of the country and other infrastructure
systems.<p>

Leaders seem to start becoming aware of how terrible the infrastructure
of the US has become, because very little funding has been allocated
for repairs for many years.  So there is definitely a NEED
for massive work on the infrastructure in the US.<p>

It will be interesting to see IF the government chooses to approach
this as they traditionally have, of HIRING giant contractors to
do the repairs, ASSUMING those contractors would hire huge numbers
of workers to do the work.  This happens to be an extremely inefficient
approach, I believe.  An obvious example was when President Bush
gave $100 billion (of our taxpayer money) to a handful of very large
contractors (who also happened to be good friends of his!) and where
it was found by Reporters later that only about $1 billion of actual
work had gotten done.  The other $99 billion sort of disappeared
inside those giant corporations!  Is THAT what they are going to do
on a much larger scale this time?<p>

It seems that the approach that FDR used in the 1930s was far wiser.
The government DIRECTLY offered to hire millions of manual laborers,
at modest pay rates, and those jobs were all rapidly filled.  Those
millions of workers did not have much Prosperity right then, but at
least they had consistent income so that their families were able
to eat.<p>

I am mentioning this here for a reason!  Around 1990, I had invented
and (nearly) fully Designed an impressive NEW transportation system
for the US.  The transportation would NOT require any fossil fuels
to be burned, a wonderful side benefit!  Automobiles and (most) trucks
would be replaced by a system where people and products traveled at
200 mph instead of the 55 mph on highways, with NO traffic jams or any
other delays.  Better yet, the system is so efficient that the
fees for traveling from Chicago to New York should be around $5 (one way),
less than 1/20 of the cost of an airplane trip (which would actually
involve about the same total amount of travel time!)<p>

When you have been at drive-through banks, you have seen the pneumatic
tubes and canisters which transfer papers and money very rapidly
into and out of the bank.  In the late 1980s, I discovered a way
where a large version of that concept could transport people and
products in very large canisters (which I called pods), AND that
it was possible to use a well-known Bernoulli Effect of Physics
to enable the pods to essentially FLY inside of a system of fixed
tubes.  This results in very little friction, and extremely efficient
operation.  FAR better than the average 21% overall efficiency of
modern cars!<p>

HERE is where the SOLUTION arrives!<p>

First, such a National system would require many MILLIONS of
pods to be manufactured, either to transport products or to transport
people.  General Motors, Ford and Chrysler happen to already
have many very large factories, which could easily be converted
to making such pods rather than conventional vehicles.  MILLIONS
OF JOBS would be involved and VERY RELIABLE for many years!<p>

Second, the system of the tubes themselves are designed as being
EXISTING concrete culverts (of 5 foot diameter).  My plan involved
installing THREE of these concrete tubes down the Median of each
Interstate highway (one each direction and the third to take
the traffic when either needed any repairs).  Many other locations
of such tubes could be installed in other locations, as desired.
MILLIONS OF CONSTRUCTION JOBS for several years would provide
reliable income for other Americans.<p>

Third, the infrastructure of the US would not just be REPAIRED,
but REPLACED with an entire system that was GREEN (no fossil fuels),
VERY FAST, and incredibly useful.<p>

Fourth, hundreds of thousands of computer and electronics
workers would assemble the computer control system for this system.
Each pod would have a bar-coding pattern on its side, and as it
passed scanners along the system, its exact position would always
be known to the computer.  When that pod needed to be diverted
into a different tube path to get to the desired destination,
the system would use all that information to divert just that
one pod, leaving all the other pods ahead of it and behind it
on their original path.<p>

I trust you see that quite a few million people would be earning
at least moderate amounts of income, for a number of years while
the American economic system gradually recovered from its problems.
And at the end, we would wind up with a wonderful NEW transportation
system that was far BETTER than anything existing today.<p>

Finally, NO NEW TECHNOLOGIES are necessary or involved!  This could
be started IMMEDIATELY!<p>

WITHOUT something like this, the US is certain to have severe
economic and financial problems for quite a few years.  It seems
extremely obvious to me that this concept SHOULD be at least
carefully examined, and then probably IMMEDIATELY implemented!<p>

<a name="10"><font size='+2'><b>Bodyfat Disposal</b></font></a><br><br>

It does not seem appropriate here to discuss all the biochemistry
involved in when bodyfat is used by the body, but suffice it to say that
the complex lipid carbohydrate molecules are broken down into
smaller molecules (often acetyl coenzyme A) to be transported by the blood to
(muscle) cells that need the energy they contain.  There are a LOT of
chemical reactions which occur, many of which are in what is called the
Kreb's Cycle.<p>

The results of that Cycle are ATP molecules that are compact energy
carriers, and also liquid water and dissolved carbon dioxide gas.
These are now waste products of the body, and they are primarily
transported by the blood to the lungs, where the water can evaporate
to make the outgoing breath get up to near 100% relative humidity
(to be able to get rid of the greatest amount of water per breath)
and also up to about 4.4% total concentration of carbon dioxide
(limited by Dalton's Law of Partial pressures).<p>

By the way, you might see the connection here between when you do
serious exercise and then have to breathe heavily for a while?
The body has to have that heavy breathing to actually get RID of the
carbon dioxide it produced!
In doing strenuous exercise, you DO use up some bodyfat molecules (but a
disappointingly small amount of them.  We will shortly see in the Technical
paragraph below that even when we exercise hard enough where our breath is
TWICE normal, that only removes the carbon from around 1/1100 pound
of bodyfat per minute.  <b>A full hour of such strenuous exercise and we can
remove only around 1/20 pound of bodyfat!</b>).  Due to the requirements
of the exercise, the body naturally accesses some of your energy
supplies, first, the sugars, which are most easily accessed
fast, but then eventually the bodyfat stores.  As those sugar or lipid
molecules are oxidized, carbon dioxide molecules are formed, which get
carried in the blood to the lungs and then exhaled with the next outgoing
breath.  If you do TWICE as much exertion, then twice as much
of the lipid (bodyfat) molecules get oxidized, and twice as much
exhaled breath is needed to carry all that carbon away from the body!
Now you know!  (You also breathe more heavily to get more oxygen
INTO the body, to be able to do all that oxidization of all that
carbon into carbon dioxide.  The body has an immense number of
unique chemical reactions, and we have greatly simplified the
matter here!)<p>

<b>This brief discussion is intended to show you that virtually
ALL the carbon that can leave your body must leave by your
exhaled breath, and that all the impressive claims of flashy
advertising which claim otherwise are simply not credible.</b>
IF some program causes you to BREATHE MORE HEAVILY, either
deeper breathing or faster breathing or both, THAT WILL directly
increase your body's ability to get rid of undesired bodyfat.
Such a program also needs to cause your Metabolism to
speed up to actually process/oxidize some bodyfat and make the carbon
dioxide available to the lungs.
<b>So the next time you see any of those ads on TV or elsewhere,
THINK about whether they are describing any credible way where
your breathing is increased.  If not, there is no realistic
reason to spend money to buy what they are promoting!</b><p>

On a more technical level, each INCOMING breath draws in
air which is at the natural 0.039% of carbon dioxide, and each
outgoing breath contains around a maximum of 4.4% of carbon dioxide.
When sitting, we breathe around 12 times per minute and each normal
breath is around 0.5 liter of air.  This all means that in each
minute of normal breathing, we CAN exhale around 0.26 liter of carbon
dioxide.  The actual exhaled air is not always saturated
with carbon dioxide but it is usually close.<p>

This means that each minute, we each (normally) exhale around 0.0405 gram
of carbon dioxide, or around 1/1000 of a pound.  (In an entire
year of normal breathing, we each exhale around 500 pounds of
carbon dioxide!)  In each minute, this includes around 1/3500 pound
(or 0.11 gram) of actual carbon atoms.  <b>They could have come from
normal foods or from stored bodyfat.</b>  If they had come from normal food
molecules, that represents around 1/1400 pound (0.3 gram) of food which
would &quot;disappear&quot; during that minute (of normal breathing).
At 2200 Calories per pound of normal food, that is around 1.6 Calories
of food per minute gets used up.  If they had instead come from lipid
bodyfat molecules, (a far more compact source of energy) that would
represent around 1/2200 pound (0.2 gram) of bodyfat which would disappear
during that minute (of normal breathing).  This ONLY occurs when the person
has not recently eaten enough food to provide the energy needed for
all bodily activities, where stored energy needs to be used up.  At 3500
Calories per pound of bodyfat, that again means that around 1.6 Calories
worth of energy would be provided, this time from bodyfat, every minute.
Since a day includes 1440 minutes, either case here accounts for the 2,200
Calories of energy that our metabolism needs to use up every day to keep us
alive.  Also, 1.6 Calories per minute times 60 minutes is around 100 Calories
per hour of sedentary activity, which also agrees with the ASHRAE
figures for heat given off by a human body.<p>

This then confirms that each minute of regular breathing necessarily
requires the exhaling of the carbon atoms from whatever food or bodyfat
materials were consumed during that minute.  <b>That process of exhaling is
essentially the ONLY process the body has of removing carbon from itself!</b><p>

In a bizarre Physicist's-view of this matter, I tend to wonder if
someone could somehow &quot;slightly extra-ventilate&quot; for an extended
time, and whether that might result in some bodyfat loss WITHOUT
even having to work out?  Strange, huh?  I wonder if the brain would
DECIDE to increase its Basal Metabolism, just because it now could.  And
whether anyone could be trained to learn to keep up the (10%) faster or
deeper breathing on a regular basis is not known.  Sounds like something a
Research Lab should do a Study on!  Since we know that we breathe
around 12 times each minute, and thereby exhale the carbon atoms from
all the day's pound of eaten food, the idea of training a brain-body
to increase that breathing rate to 13 times per minute seems reasonable.
No one would even notice this slight change, and we know that the
human body can be trained in thousands of ways.  The point would be that
instead of exhaling the carbon from 16 ounces of eaten food (as calculated
here and in the <b><a href="http://mb-soft.com/public3/weight.html">Bodyfat, Weight Loss, the Physics of Body Weight Control</a></b>
presentation, that minor change would enable the body to get rid
of the carbon from an additional 1.3 ounces of food materials, each day.
If done for an entire year, that would possibly represent an additional
consumption of over 30 pounds of bodyfat!  Interesting!<p>

Physicists always try to see reasons for failure in
such hypotheses.  In this case, if the body was actually not
doing any extra work, maybe the brain would see no reason to
initiate additional Metabolic activity.  Human and animal
patterns suggest that no wasteful decisions like that are made,
in order to maintain maximum survival capability for some future
emergency.  So even if the breathing was slightly increased,
it might be that the CONCENTRATION of carbon
dioxide in the exhaled breath might simply become reduced!<p>

Another Physicist's aspect of this, which seems far more interesting,
is <b>the question of whether overweight people might breathe more
shallowly than other people.</b>  I have not located
any research that has ever been done on this subject.  Wouldn't it be sort
of funny of the entire obesity problem might be eased or even solved
by simply teaching overweight people to breathe slightly more deeply?
I have no idea whether that would actually be of value or not, but
it certainly seems to be worthy of serious scientific investigation!<p>

<a name="11"><font size='+2'><b>Energy in a PERFECT Battery-Powered Car</b></font></a><br><br>

Several of the automotive-related presentations in this Domain include
the complete analysis of calculating the Aerodynamic Drag of any
vehicle and also the Tire Drag.  It is not that difficult but we are
going to leave out the details here.  The details and calculations are
in the specific pages about those subjects.  Suffice it to say that an
extremely aerodynamic sports car might have an Aerodynamic Drag
of 100 pounds at 60 mph speed (which is essentially used up in
pushing the air out of the way of the vehicle, and then in turbulence
as that air again filled the space where the vehicle had just passed
through) which has the effect
of transferring that energy to the air and thereby very slightly
heating it up!  Similarly, it is easy to see that around 30 pounds
of Tire Drag would exist.  This energy mostly gets used up in flexing
the sidewalls of the tires every time they rotate, which causes the
tires to get too hot to touch after an extended highway drive.
Add the two to get the total vehicle Drag, in this case 130 pounds.<p>

For comparison, a C-4 Corvette, a rather aerodynamic car, has an
aerodynamic drag of about 117 pounds and a tire drag of about 48
pounds at 60 mph, for a total vehicle Drag of 165 pounds.  So the
numbers we are using are very optimistic!<p>

By multiplying that 130 pounds total Drag by the vehicle velocity
(88 feet/second, which is what 60 mph is), we get 11,440 lb-ft/sec.  This can
be converted into other forms, such as 20.8 horsepower or 15.5 kilowatts.<p>

<b>IF WE ASSUME THE VEHICLE AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECTLY
EFFICIENT</b> we would then see that a one-hour, 40 mph, drive would use up
15.5 kWh of power.  So say that it was a battery-powered, electric motor
vehicle.  Once the batteries had used up the necessary 15.5 kWh of
electricity, <b>it would have to be replaced by re-charging the batteries.</b><p>

It is clear that we would need just over 9 hours of charging at the
maximum 15 amperes that a standard home 110 volt electrical outlet
could provide (9h * 15a * 110v = 14.9 kWh) or that a standard heavy-duty
extension cord could carry.  <b>NINE HOURS!</b><p>

To drive ONE hour, NINE hours of charging would be required, simply by
the basic Laws of science regarding Conservation of Energy!<p>

But MOST promotional literature for electric vehicles talks about
two-hour or three-hour recharge times, and they nearly always make
sure to mention that a standard outlet and a standard heavy-duty extension
cord could be used!  Do you see where their statements are attempting to
violate very basic laws of science?<p>

What they are usually doing is applying the common aspects of trickery
used in most modern advertising.  A woodstove might be advertised as
&quot;able to heat your entire home&quot; and also &quot;able to hold a
fire for 20 hours.&quot;.  Each statement is potentially true, and they
probably have tested evidence that each is NOT a lie so they do not get
sued!  But their advertising LEADS READERS TO THINK THAT BOTH ARE
TRUE AT THE SAME TIME, which turns out to simply be impossible!  It COULD be
fired hard to produce enough heat for a small house, but then the wood
gets used up fast and is gone in an hour.  But if it is used to only
heat one small room on a mild day, yes, it might hold a fire for 20 hours.<p>

In the case of electric vehicles, a common statement is that it can be
re-charged in just two hours.  Yes, that might be true if you had only
gone to the grocery store!  And they make SEPARATE claims regarding
high speed or long driving range.  If I was forced to have to make such
a statement, I would probably arrange for a vehicle to travel at ONE
mph!  At that speed, the aerodynamic Drag is extremely low, and even
the Tire Drag is lower, especially if I filled them with 90 pounds
of air pressure!  Extremely little electricity would get used
up in going that mile in that hour!  Say a (private) Test Track was
set up to allow this vehicle to constantly circle a track.  In a MONTH
that vehicle would have traveled around 720 miles, and the batteries
STILL probably would not actually yet need to be re-charged.  Such
a test, with some Stamp of Approval from some Independent Observer, would be
able to actually claim that the vehicle had gone 720 miles and more before
needing to be re-charged.  The manufacturer would then feel free to
brag about a 720-mile range.<p>

It would technically not be a lie, but no one would ever ride in a
vehicle that only traveled at 1/3 walking speed!  But it certainly
could be done as just described, and that manufacturer would certainly
promote the daylights out of such a statement, knowing that it would sell
massive numbers of their vehicles.  Of course, once people actually
BOUGHT the vehicles and they all found that it could not even go
an hour, 60 miles, at highway speed, people would know they had been
deceived.  But exactly what could they do about it?  The manufacturer
would have an Attested confirmation that their vehicle had traveled
720 miles without needing a re-charge.  Would any Judge find them
guilty of any crime?  I don't see how.  And THEY know that!<p>

The point here is that modern promotional and advertising executives
feel that there are NO rules regarding ethics or principles or morals
regarding getting their advertising commissions!  They are willing to
say absolutely anything.  If a manufacturer had also been deceitful
to have done silly Test Runs as I just described, there is virtually no
limit to what they might feel free to claim.<p>

Regarding many claims, remembering that this is a technology that
is still being born, it certainly seems that claims are made that
actually only apply to ONE PART of the complete system.  I have seen
statements where a manufacturer announces 98% efficiency of the electric
motor.  That might technically be a true statement, but any real
SYSTEM requires wires and controls and batteries and chargers and much
more, all of which degrade any possible claims regarding (overall)
efficiency.  I remember seeing, in the 1970s, advertising of a
very poorly efficient fireplace which claimed &quot;98% combustion
efficiency&quot;.  That statement was actually true, but irrelevant!
Their heat transfer efficiency was horrendous, around 20%, so the best
any owner could ever actually see was just under 20% (the product of the
two efficiencies.)  No one stopped that company from claiming that because
it was actually true.  But they quickly angered so many buyers that
word got out about their ethics and they soon disappeared!.<p>

<a name="12"><font size='+2'><b>Photovoltaic (solar to electric) Devices</b></font></a><br><br>

There are occasional news reports about some new PV technology that
allegedly has 30% efficiency.  A Reporter listens to a Company
Spokesperson say that over 100 watts of sunlight power arrives
in every square foot (true, at noon, on a perfectly sunny day, if
the collecting panel is aimed exactly at the Sun).  The Spokesperson
then ASSUMES that the customer will buy the state-of-the-air technology
which IS 30% efficient, and PREDICTS that 32 square feet of such PV panels
(the size of a sheet of plywood or wall paneling) COULD therefore capture a
spectacular amount of electricity (110w/sf * 32sf * 30% = 1050 Watts
of electricity!  And the villagers rejoice at this amazing news!<p>

But that Spokesperson left out a LOT of important facts!  Such as that
the technology mentioned is still astoundingly expensive and hard to
produce, currently costing maybe $100,000 per square foot!  Such as that most
climates have clouds, and that the Sun is NOT always in the ideal
location, and that the PV panels are NOT always aimed exactly at the Sun!<p>

The Spokesperson did not actually lie, but was DECEPTIVE in many ways!<p>

The REALITY is that PV panels that most people can afford to buy are
of a technology called Cadmium Sulfide, which happens to have atomic
properties where they are around 7% efficient.  That a climate like Chicago
has a lot of clouds, and that an annual cloudiness factor is often
described as around 65% (or sky clearness of around 35%, or sometimes
described as 34%). That a FIXED POSITION PV panel (facing
south, at some angle upward) has geometric disadvantages when the Sun
is in the eastern or western sky.<p>

So a REALISTIC EXPECTATION of that 32 square feet of PV panels is more
likely to be (110 w/sf * 32 sf * 7% * (100% - 65%) * 0.4 = a truly
consistent and reliable supply of only about 35 Watts
of electricity!<p>

This is EXTREMELY different from what the Spokesperson tried to lead
potential buyers to believe!  It would be GREAT if we could expect that area
of PV panels to produce 3400 Watts or 1050 Watts, but the reality is that
it would likely produce an AVERAGE of only 35 Watts instead.  Granted
that there WILL be days which are cloud free and at noon on such a
day, briefly, as much as 220 Watts of electricity might be produced.  But for
an installation in that region of normal cloudiness, a 12 hour period of
sunlight might therefore be expected to produce a total average
of about 420 Watt-hours per day.  Noting that you now pay maybe 15 cents
per kiloWatt-hour (including Delivery costs and taxes), this is a benefit of
around 7 cents of electricity produced for you! A solid $26 of FREE
electricity for you!  This is due to you having spent between $3200 and
$4800 to install the PV panels and the associated electronics and batteries.
What a deal!  In maybe 150 years, you will have gotten enough electricity
to equal what you paid for the equipment (assuming that nothing needs
any repairs during that 150 years).<p>

The manufacturers and salespeople and spokespeople for PV devices
know that they could never actually admit that, or no one would
ever buy the products they are trying to sell!<p>

So the public is permitted and encouraged to have a totally wrong,
sugar-plum-type view of what magic that PVs can do for them!  Someone is
allowed to come to assume that a few square feet of PV panels will provide
them with a consistent and reliable 1050 Watts all day every day, and so
they believe that they will be able to fully operate their entire
household on such a wonderful supply of electricity.  But then once
they spend all the many thousand dollars to buy the equipment and then
to have it all installed, THEN they discover that they ACTUALLY can
only RELIABLY count on an average of around 35 Watts instead.  That is
NOT even enough to light a single 100 Watt light bulb!<p>

Yes, after an entire day of collecting sunlight, such a setup CAN
collect a total of around 400 Watt-hours of electricity, but then after
that electricity is put INTO batteries and then later taken back
OUT of the batteries, you can count on actually having around 300 Wh
of USABLE electricity from that entire day.  You could light that
one light bulb for about three hours.  Is THAT worth spending
many thousands of dollars for?  IF people know the actual facts,
it seems unlikely that many people would think so.<p>

I realize that it does not seem like it from these comments, but I
VERY STRONGLY ENCOURAGE EXPERIMENTING in Photovoltaics and other
alternative energy methods. As long as a customer approaches the
matter as an EXPERIMENT and an ADVENTURE, fine.  What I rebel to is
the fact that few customers are remotely told the truth, in order
to encourage them to have those sugar-plum-dreams of all the
amazing benefits they will receive. If based on HONEST facts and HONEST
information, I'm in!  But if everything is based on deception and
distortion and misleading customers, NO, NO, NO!<p>

This whole realm is another example where ADVERTISERS promote
PEAK RATINGS for their products, the absolute maximum that they
had ever been able to get their products to produce in a test
laboratory, under absolutely perfect conditions,
while USERS later discover that such numbers are
nearly always useless and irrelevant, as they use such products
in REAL environments!  Many of the energy-related presentations in
this Domain are intended to help the public learn what the actual
facts are and the reality is!  Where they might then listen to the
spectacular claims of advertising, and be in a position to then be
able to ASK INFORMED QUESTIONS!  &quot;Yes, yes, I realize that
the numbers you just cited are possible with this product, but that
was in a laboratory under perfect conditions.  I do not have such
ideal conditions, so I want to know what I will be likely to
see in MY application.  I want to know an AVERAGE PERFORMANCE
that I can expect for a day or a week or a month or a year.
Can I get that in writing???&quot;<p>

Salespeople have never had to deal with such tough questions, because
the public has never been informed enough to be able to ask them!
You know the horror stories of Used Car Dealers! An unsuspecting customer
wanders in and expects to hear TRUTH about a vehicle, but the Dealer
knows that the Customer will have to sign a Disclaimer that prominently
states AS IS, so the Dealer knows he is free to say essentially
anything he thinks this customer might swallow!
Similarly, Reporters have never known enough background information
to ask such tough questions either, so news reports have ALWAYS only
shown people being allowed to talk about the IDEAL operation of the
product which has gotten them on TV or in the newspaper!  Such Reporter
interviews are ALWAYS with either a Representative of the Company
trying to sell the products or with Customers that have glee and
enthusiasm of Christmas morning regarding the presents Santa
brought.  We feel that an interview with that kid in April or May
might be a more realistic assessment of that toy or bike!<p>

<a name="14"><font size='+2'><b>What?  Modifying a Cow?</b></font></a><br><br>

A REALLY interesting but strange idea has occurred to me!  And this
figures to either be totally worthless or worth many billions of dollars!<p>

This is VAGUELY related to the HeatGreen concept!<p>

There are TWO ways that organic material can decompose.  One is if there
is minimal oxygen around, which turns out to be the usual case inside
the stomachs of cows and humans and other mammals, which is called
ANAEROBIC DIGESTION.  It uses a type of bacteria which are called
ANAEROBIC BACTERIA.  Anaerobic digestion is NOT very efficient!  Among
other things, the chemical composition does not completely occur and
there is considerable METHANE GAS which is generated. All the jokes
about cows and flatulence in people are due to this.  (Did you know
that virtually ALL people are flatulent around TWENTY TIMES every day?)
Anaerobic bacteria also cannot digest some organic materials, which
we call FIBER, which then necessarily pass right through us (and cows).
The other method is FAR more efficient, and it is called AEROBIC
DIGESTION.  It uses a different type of bacteria, which are FAR FASTER
and more effective in digesting virtually all organic materials.
More importantly, those aerobic bacteria can nearly completely digest
ALL foods!  NO methane gas is generated, just carbon dioxide (which
has no smell!)  And nearly all the food eaten gets digested, which
provides more energy for the cow or person and leaves less waste material
to dispose of!<p>

I designed the HG concept to use AEROBIC bacteria, because they are so
much (1) more efficient; (2) faster; and (3) able to decompose far more
organic materials; than ANAEROBIC bacteria can do.  The anaerobic are worse
in all those ways,  The bacteria in your intestine or that of a cow
are bacteria that can survive and operate in an anaerobic environment.
Anaerobic bacteria also tend to form METHANE gas (CH<sub>4</sub>)
(which you call flatulence) and that anaerobic digestion leaves a lot of
unprocessed material (which you call manure). In tremendous contrast,
aerobic digestion generally results entirely in producing CO<sub>2</sub>
and H<sub>2</sub>O. This is FAR more efficient digestion, of being able
to get SEVERAL TIMES AS MUCH ENERGY BENEFIT for the body, if and when
aerobic digestion might be regularly done.<p>

In 2008, I had extended that aerobic/anaerobic thought about potential
experiments to create &quot;super-human athletes&quot; by either sliding
two &quot;air hoses&quot; down the esophagus to the stomach, or doing
an operation to insert such hoses through the abdomen.<p>

Here was my thinking at the time:  If one of those hoses had an air
pump and filter, and the other hose was there to release &quot;used
gases&quot;, then the stomach and intestine would have a constant supply
of FAR MORE oxygen in them than is normally the case.  And then, like
in the HG, it should then only take a few hours before AEROBIC bacteria
start digesting the food contents.<p>

<ul>
<li>(1) digestion would probably then be FAR faster.
<li>(2) digestion should then include many things that we cannot now
   digest, such as &quot;fibre&quot; or &quot;roughage&quot; or even cut
   lawn grass (which we humans are incapable of digesting and it goes
   straight through us!), meaning MORE energy capture from the food eaten.
<li>(3) and digestion should then be so complete that we would NOT need
to &quot;pass gas&quot; twenty times every day (the experimental average
of humans getting rid of the methane that we create).  It seems likely
that the amount of manure might also greatly decrease, for having had
far more of the materials having been fully digested.
</ul><p>

At the time, I was only thinking in terms of &quot;pro athletes&quot;
but I never liked the idea as being somewhat like the illegal drugs
that many star athletes use to get an unfair advantage.<p>

So what is the NEW insight?  Say that an Animal Husbandry Researcher
would install the pair of air tubes and a small air compressor INTO A COW?<p>

The result SHOULD be that the cow's metabolism should greatly
increase, maybe double or triple normal.<p>

A MILK COW might then PRODUCE double or triple the milk per day!
And beef cattle might grow two to three times faster, WITHOUT having
to add all the nasty chemicals in their feed!<p>

This then MIGHT enormously increase the US milk and beef supplies,
possibly without the cows consuming any additional feed!  It would
be ENTIRELY due to their having become far more EFFICIENT at digesting
food, by aerobic rather than the current normal anaerobic processes!<p>

There are many unknown variables!  For one thing, cows happen to
have a multiple chamber stomach, which enables them to already
digest grass and roughage and fiber.  Would there be any effect, good
or bad, to be pumping in extra air into those stomachs?<p>

I admit that I have doubts!  It might not work at all, or it might
have detrimental side effects.  Specifically, the stomach might start
to operate at far higher temperatures than has always naturally
been the case. The bacteria that now digest our food for us and for
cows operate at around 99&#176;F temperature. I am speculating about
a far higher performance bacteria taking over.  Many are known to
thrive best when the temperature is over 125&#176;F. Would that
kill the cow? I do not know and only an experiment could find that out.
But for a Research Program to invest a few hundred dollars in ONE COW,
and then letting it re-join its cow-friends out in a meadow
to watch IF it ate more or less or different stuff, and to constantly
monitor body temperature and respiration rates,
it seems like a worthwhile expense.<p>

You might be amused at WHY this dawned on me now!  I have always
been amazed since I first discovered the research on humans, about ten years
ago, that we all &quot;pass gas&quot; around 20 times every single day.
And there are all the jokes about cows and methane gas.  It dawned
on me that IF I &quot;converted&quot; cows from anaerobic to aerobic,
then they should no longer be producing methane gas.  Or nearly as
many cow patties!  I was thinking about whether THAT might be a
worthwhile goal, when I realized the &quot;increased milk production&quot;
and &quot;increased beef production&quot; consequences which should
also occur!<p>

<a name="15"><font size='+2'><b>Is the Universe mostly Dark Matter?</b></font></a><br><br>

There has never been any actual evidence of this idea.  When the BASIS
of this concept is examined, it was ENTIRELY due to scientists
not having any valid explanation for the way our Milky Way
Galaxy rotates.  Hundreds of years ago, a scientist named Kepler
had discovered some formulas that describe the gravitational
behavior of the planets in our Solar System.  Later, Isaac Newton
proved that Kepler's formulas were actually only approximate, and that
they were pretty accurate in the Solar System BECAUSE nearly all the
mass in the Solar System is inside the Sun at its very center.<p>

And yet, the Physics community chose to try to apply Kepler's
Laws to the Galaxy, where the mass is known to be broadly distributed
over its entire size!  And then when the Galaxy did not rotate
as they insisted it should (per Kepler), they started dreaming up
dozens and dozens of really silly ideas that each claimed would
fully explain everything!<p>

Some have claimed that spiral galaxies are NOT spiral at all,
but only APPEAR to be spiral due to effects of (speculated, unseen
and unproven) gravity waves passing through the galaxy to cause
gravitational shock waves, which allegedly cause localized
star burst patterns where new stars get formed.  They seem to overlook
the fact that NO shock wave from ANY direction could cause SPIRAL
PATTERNS of star bursts!  IF there were such a phenomenon, it would
certainly be seen as PLANAR sheets of bright new stars, which would
gradually pass through that region!<p>

But most other Physicists seem to insist that the Galaxy rotation that
they cannot explain is due to massive clumps of invisible material
in the Galaxy.  IF such an explanation were valid, the DISTRIBUTION of
where that invisible mass would have to be would be truly bizarre!
AND VERY UNSTABLE!  But more than that, IF there were such invisible
masses in the Galaxy, they would also attract OTHER parts of the Galaxy
which the proponents ignore!  Such concepts are so amazingly silly
that it is hard to believe that ANY actual Physicist would even
consider it worth thought!  But THIS is what NEARLY ALL modern
Astrophysicists now believe!  At different times, they have called the
invisible material Missing Mass, Neutrinos, Exotic Matter, Dark Matter, and
other things. But NONE of them can be arranged in any actual pattern where
they would have the gravitational effects that are claimed for them, and NONE
of them would be remotely stable even if they could momentarily exist.<p>

I feel that a far more simple and traditional explanation explains these
matters far better.  NO weird and speculative assumptions are necessary
at all!  Just SIMPLE gravitation that Newton calculated for us hundreds
of years ago, BUT examined for a DISTRIBUTED MASS.  Duh!<p>

<a name="16"><font size='+2'><b>Are There Black Holes?</b></font></a><br><br>

This is a concept that is so deeply ingrained in modern society that
even little kids refer to them all the time!  It is hard to see how
and why they became such a cornerstone of modern Astrophysics!<p>

Around 1912, Albert Einstein derived some very complicated equations
as part of his General Relativity Theory.  Around 1916, another
Physicist named Schwarzschild derived a solution to part of them.
In his result, his equations acted strangely where in some
very specific locations, the math denominator dropped to zero!
This meant that the number itself would become infinity.
<b>This became known as a singularity.</b>  Neither Einstein nor Schwarzschild
had any idea of what such a mathematical singularity might actually
mean in the real universe.  But around 1960, some Physicists chose
to entirely ignore the real nature of actual material (atoms) and instead
consider everything to be describable by mathematics.  This assumption
permitted them to make a rather strange assumption!  The first part of it
was reasonably credible, where a white dwarf star developed such extreme
high density that the atoms of the star (separate protons in the nuclei and
electrons revolving around them) being gravitationally jammed together
into everything become neutrons (because neutrons are known to be
simply the coupling of positively charged protons and negatively charged
electrons, and some extra Binding Energy.  THIS then was a hypothesis
that there must be NEUTRON STARS, of even smaller diameters, objects
which have the mass of an entire star but all of which is packed into
a space that may only be a few miles in diameter.<p>

Since Neutron stars are not charged electrically, they would not
affect any objects passing near them, except by gravitation.  And they
are (probably) not hot enough to give off any radiation, so detecting
Neutron Stars has been an extremely hard task.  The only real
possibilities found have been in binary star systems, where the
larger star that IS giving off light is seen to be apparently orbiting
with an unseen companion object of great mass.<p>

Well, the part that seems outrageous to me is that someone ASSUMED
that if gravitation can be so strong as to force an electron INSIDE
the nucleus of an atom to create a neutron, then even greater gravitation
(due to even higher density) would cause TWO neutrons to get embedded
within each other.  This would then create a new object that was the
size of a neutron, but with TWICE the mass of a normal neutron.<p>

Well, IF that assumption is accepted as credible, then it is easy to
see that the new double-neutron would have TWICE the gravitational
attraction to a neighbor neutron, and therefore it would certainly
suck that one into the object.  We would then have an object which still
had the size of a normal neutron, but now with THREE TIMES the mass!
And this would obviously mean that it would even more quickly suck
in a fourth neutron, then a fifth, and so on.<p>

This rather weak line of reasoning continues on <i>ad infinitatum</i>.
There would allegedly never be any limit, and this object would forever
keep absorbing more neutrons (and other objects) into that still tiny
space of the size of one neutron.  For a few years in the 1960s,
Physicists would say that this object would be the size of a neutron
but with the mass of our Sun or a thousand or a million Suns.
Eventually, that sort of statement stopped being said.  I think it
was due to the speakers realizing how ridiculous it sounds!<p>

In any case, THAT is still the case, the entire reasoning of what
a Black Hole would be.  But it really could only have gotten to be
that popular a concept by two conditions:  (1) that no Physicist seems
to have ever carefully examined the physical reality of what is described
above; and (2) that no Physicist seems to have examined that the ENTIRE
basis for this very speculative concept was the SINGLE solution by
Schwarzschild of Einstein's General Relativity equations around 90 years
ago!  And yet it is ABSOLUTELY ACCEPTED WITHOUT ANY QUESTION OR DOUBT
AT ALL!<p>

<a name="17"><font size='+2'><b>Is the Twins Paradox True?  Not a Chance!</b></font></a><br><br>

This is another bit of lore which somehow arose from the Physics
community.  Many modern Physicists passionately defend that
story, and they actually must, as several entire fields of modern
AstroPhysics are based entirely on the assumption that the Twins
Paradox is valid.  It is not!<p>

The very popular Twins Paradox is absolutely untrue and impossible,
and that is actually for really obvious reasons!<p>

Einstein had died a few years before the Twins Paradox was first
presented.  If he had still been alive, he would certainly have
immediately pointed out a major error in it!  His Relativity was
entirely based on the concept that the Universe has to seem logical
for every viewer in every situation.  The Twins Paradox definitely
does not comply with that!  It ONLY considers the appearance FROM
THE EARTH, which makes it immediately invalid regarding Relativity!
The premise is based on a TRUE situation that for a NON-ACCELERATING
situation, a moving target must always appear to be aging more
slowly than the observer senses.  This is a special case of Relativity
called Special Relativity, which only applies for non-accelerating
situations.<p>

The error in the Twins Paradox is really obvious if one considers
ONLY the perspective of the person in the spacecraft!  HE senses
no speed at all.  But he sees the Earth seem to be shooting away
at very high velocity!  Logically, he must then see life on Earth
passing MORE SLOWLY than he personally experiences.  This is an
unavoidable statement.  However, the Earth observers feel that THEY
are motionless and that he is rapidly moving away from them.  So THEY TOO
see this Time Dilation effect, where they see HIM appear to be aging
more slowly than they are aging!  <b>Both viewers see the other as
aging more slowly than he ages!</b>  I realize this sounds impossible,
but the very basis of Relativity insists on that fact.  There IS an
explanation, and it is totally logical, and even mathematically
supported.  It is a little complicated, but it is certainly the truth,
and the Twins Paradox is not true and even impossible!<p>

As it happens, the &quot;binding energy&quot; for an electron that is in a large
orbit, or a planet that is in a large orbit, is LESS (when compared to
a situation of infinite distance where the binding energy is zero)
than for one in a smaller orbit.  In fact, in both the case of an
electrostatic orbit of an electron and a gravitational orbit of a planet,
the inverse square law applies, meaning that FOUR TIMES as much binding
energy (has to) exists for an electron or planet in an orbit of half
the radius.<p>

The result of this is that electrons which have been strongly ionized,
to have MORE energy, are necessarily in SMALLER orbits, where the
electrostatic attraction for is stronger.  This is exactly OPPOSITE

<a name="31"><font size="+2"><b>Regarding Carbon Dioxide in an Old Auditorium</b></font></a><br><br>

Consider an auditorium which is 200 feet by 100 feet, and therefore
seats about 3,000 people (at the US legal 7 square feet per person).
Give it a fairly high ceiling at 20 feet.  We therefore have 400,000
cubic feet of air inside the room.  Normal air is now around 400 ppmv
of carbon dioxide, so there is about 158 cubic feet of actual carbon
dioxide in the room to start with.<p>

We have 3,000 people in the room listening to the lecture.  They
each breathe about 12 times every minute, and each breath is about
0.5 liters of exhaled air.  So, every minute, they exhale about
3,000 * 0.5 * 12 or 18,000 liters of breathes, which is about
510 cubic feet of breaths.  Because of something
called Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures, that exhaled breath air can only
be about 4.4% carbon dioxide, so each minute adds about 22 cubic feet
more of exhaled carbon dioxide into the auditorium.  Over a boring
three-hour lecture, 180 minutes, that is about 4,100 cubic feet of
additional carbon dioxide in the room, just because of all those people
breathing!<p>

If the building had been absolutely airtight, our quantity of
carbon dioxide in the room would have risen from 156 cubic feet up
to more than 4,200 cubic feet, <b>an increase by a factor of about
27 times!</b>  This would increase the amount of carbon dioxide in

<a name="53"><font size='+2'><b>Dark Energy</b></font></a><br><br>

A totally stupid idea. The very term seems to contradict itself!
This strange idea was dreamed up ENTIRELY to try to explain a DIFFERENT
speculative idea, that the Universe is now wildly expanding.<p>

The existence of ANY sort of Energy implicitly implies that
any changes or any perception of changes, will create Radiation
of some sort  to maintain Conservation of Energy.  Accepted that
such created Radiation might be unfamiliar to us, but it still has
to exist AT SOME FREQUENCY and WAVELENGTH.  Meaning that it CANNOT be
&quot;dark&quot;.
In order to accept this idea, it is necessary to entirely abandon
all trust in many long trusted Laws of science, such as the
Conservation of Energy, Conservation of Momentum, Conservation of
Mass, Relativity, and many others.<p> 

Among the rampant application of unsupportable assumptions, a
recent addition is a claim that gravity is no longer really important
and that some ASSUMED new idea is the overwhelming presence in the
Universe. Recent claims are that the vast majority of the entire
Universe is made of things that we have never been away of and can
never be aware of!  There are Physicists who are now announcing that
75% of the entire Universe is made of Dark Energy and another 20%
is made of Dark Matter, claiming that the entire Universe we have
any way of knowing about is only 5% of all existence!  This bizarre idea
arose based on some observations of some objects
in the Universe which appear to be immensely far away from us.<p>

It is not possible for us to see anything more than a &quot;snapshot&quot;
of extremely distant objects in space, a single momentary view.  We
are unable to see any variations in brightness level or any other
characteristics that might be useful in determining the size or
brightness of really distant objects.  Even the DISTANCE of such
objects is a quantity which requires several ASSUMPTIONS.<p>

But apparently in the competition in modern Physics to make the
most outrageous statements, the tiniest bit of POTENTIAL evidence
has had many layers of assumptions loaded onto it, to result in a
claim that all known laws of science are to be discarded!  The claim
is that those extremely distant objects are moving away from us at
speeds which are greater for objects which are farther away from us.
Now, if that was a VALID statement, it would be amazing.  But that
statement was only dreamed up after about a half dozen ASSUMPTIONS
were applied to observed data.  Since modern Physics seems to no longer
require any PROOF of any statements made, everyone seems to feel
free to dream up any assumptions they wish, to then announce
statements as though they are actual science!  No they aren't!  They
are results of speculative imaginations of people who want to find
new assumptions to apply!<p>

The claim referred to here is totally dependent on us knowing the
accurate distance from us to each extremely distant object.  But such
distances cannot be measured!  They have to be ESTIMATED due to the
application of several assumptions.  We have NO good way of determining
reliably accurate distance information for such objects which appear to
be at extreme distances from us.  Much of that is based on spectral
lines being shifted to the red (called the Red Shift) which we ASSUME
only occurs due to the speed the object is moving away from us.
There is actually no good reason that has to be true!  There might be
TWENTY different physical processes which exist which cause Red Shifts,
but which we are still totally oblivious about!<p>

Interestingly, the main basis for the distance we think distant
objects are from us is ALSO based on the spectral Red Shift.  When both the
numerator and denominator of a fraction are based on the same number,
the value of the fraction becomes irrelevant, and that is essentially
the situation here.  Another huge assumption which has been universally
made is the idea that ALL objects in the Universe which LOOK to be of the
same type, are actually absolutely IDENTICAL!  Schoolchildren are
never allowed to make such poor assumptions, but modern Physicists feel
free to do so!  Based on these assumptions and on several more, it has
now been decided that if two ABSOLUTELY IDENTICAL OBJECTS are seen, but
they appear to be of different brightness, then one is farther away from
us as calculated by that difference of brightness.  Unbelievable!<p>

In any case, these assorted assumptions have resulted in the recent
outrageous announcement that the Universe is in runaway expansion,
essentially dismissing all the known laws of science.  As a result,
the Physicists then decided they could &quot;explain&quot; this new (alleged)
finding, by speculating an even more outrageous idea, that there
is an unseen and undetected thing they call Dark Energy.  Allegedly,
this latest speculation is supposed to be the opposite of energy and
gravitation, where it allegedly then would explain a runaway expansion
of the Universe!  It is sad that no one paused to try to confirm or
deny whether the alleged &quot;evidence&quot; of a runaway expansion is even
credible or valid, before they jumped to make even more outrageous
announcements!<p>

I tend to wonder if modern Physicists think their future Grants of
money for research will be based on how outrageous their statements
are!  Science and Physics seems to have gotten lost along the way.<p>

This idea was first thought up around the 1950s, in order to try to
provide an explanation for a long-standing mystery of mankind.
Unfortunately, the people who thought this up had to abandon acceptance
of MOST of the accepted logic, ideas and Laws of science!  They now
simply claim that conditions at the time of the Big Bang were so
extreme that our known Laws of science simply did not apply.  That then
freed them up to SPECULATE WILDLY, since they were free to claim that
scientific knowledge simply is irrelevant!  That essentially
discards ALL of three thousand years of scientific study!<p>

I suppose there is no way to prove that such irrational ideas might have
been true, as their claim that scientific logic and rules do not and
cannot apply!  So I suppose they are safe from ever being proven wrong!
But around 1960, I came up with a slightly different concept which
DOES comply with known Laws of science and also all reasonable logic!

<a name="55"><font size='+2'><b>The Existence of Black Holes</b></font></a><br><br>

The same people who had dreamed up the Big Bang as the origin of the
Universe soon also thought up the idea of Black Holes.  The basis
for this claim is amazingly &quot;thin&quot;! One of the equations that
Albert Einstein derived in trying to understand General Relativity
was especially hard to solve.  It remained unsolved until a
mathematician/Physicist named Schwarzschild found a solution for that
equation in 1916.  His solution was troublesome in that there were certain
(rare) situations where the denominator became exactly zero, which
meant that the value of his solution would have to become infinite.
Since both Einstein and Schwarzschild are universally considered to
be absolutely infallible, no one doubted Schwarzschild's solution or
his consequence of having a result which could apparently violate ALL
of known science!  But it took into the 1960s before one of those scientists
who seem to have loved to speculate came up with the idea of that
&quot;mathematical singularity&quot; of Schwarzschild being actual reality,
and the term Black Hole was dreamed up.  (Neither Einstein nor
Schwarzschild ever claimed existence of any physical singularities.)<p>

There WERE certainly very compact stars known by the 1960s,
including White Dwarfs and Brown Dwarfs.  In a nearly hilarious
speculation, one of that group of speculative thinkers decided that
Schwarzschild's mathematical singularity permitted them to claim that
it was possible for a proton to (somehow) jam itself into
the space used by a different proton!  Their claim was that gravitation
inside a really compact white dwarf caused this to happen.<p>

They neglected a really obvious FACT!  BOTH the attractive force of a
gravitational field AND the repulsive force of electrostatic repulsion
between positively-charged protons act according to the inverse square
dependence.  In other words, if two protons got twice as close,
yes, the gravitational attraction would increase by a factor of
four, but what they overlooked was that the electrostatic repulsion ALSO
increased by a factor of four.  <b>Becoming very close would
NOT cause super-strong attraction, which might (allegedly) become
so strong that two protons might exist in the space of one!</b><p>

However, IF they had been correct, then their following logic would
have worked!  The new super-proton would gravitationally
attract other protons TWICE as strongly as the gravitation that
would have3 jammed the first two protons together!  (Of course,
they also overlooked that the doubled electrical charge of the
super-proton would also have REPELLED the third proton twice
as strongly!)  So they merrily extended this (wrong) idea into
essentially becoming a gravitational vacuum cleaner which would
suck up every proton it encountered.  And they seem to have overlooked
some other logical problems in eventually having a &quot;Black Hole&quot;
which had the entire mass of a star, all tightly packed inside the
tiny space of a single atom!  But they always slid by such &quot;details&quot;
as I asked at least a hundred Physicists about this during my
Physics Education and Physics career, and was never even given
ANY response at all!  It is apparently an irrelevant question to
them, people who seem to believe that all the known Laws of
science can be ignored whenever they become inconvenient!<p>

Like many of the other wild speculations of modern Physics, the idea
of Black Holes is probably immune from serious attack.  Since they
feel that they can ignore any and all Laws of Physics if they become
&quot;inconvenient&quot;, no logical argument could ever be posited against
that idea!  And the fact that the Public has found excitement and
sexiness in a concept such as Black Holes, we are destined to have
that concept forever!  Even though it is nearly certain NOT to be
valid!<p>

about 80 years that our Milky Way Galaxy is somewhat like a flattened
pinwheel and it rotates about every 200 million years.  But Physicists
insisted on ASSUMING that it must behave according to Kepler's
Laws, which were proven to be pretty accurate regarding the rotation
of the Solar System.  They overlooked a huge detail! Newton explained
that Kepler's Laws are &quot;nearly&quot; accurate due to the fact that virtually
all the mass of the Solar System is in the Sun, at the very center.
The Galaxy is not remotely like that!  Its mass is DISTRIBUTED throughout
its entire dimensions.  Newton clearly showed that Kepler's Laws
simply cannot apply for such a situation!  Yet, Physicists overlook
that little detail and they insist that Kepler's Laws must apply in

I believe there is a FAR more logical explanation, which does not NEED

least moderately true.  Many modern Physicist ASSUME that it is
EXACTLY true!  In any case, during the 1990s, a new assumption was made.
If it is actually correct, then several peculiar new theories might have
validity.  The assumption has to do with a NEED to create a much larger NEW
measurement ruler.  It seems REALLY speculative to me!  There are
some very rare events in distant space which are called Type 1-A
Supernova.  Only a couple of them have EVER been seen in or near
our Milky Way Galaxy.  But it is ASSUMED that the amount of radiation
given off during the Type 1-A Supernova explosion is a FIXED amount.
Evidence of possible Type 1-A Supernovae have (rarely) been detected in VERY
distant galaxies.  It has been ASSUMED that the DISTANCE of those
galaxies MUST BE defined due to the ASSUMED DISTANCE of the Type
1-A Supernova (ASSUMING THAT ALL OF THESE RARE OBJECTS MUST BE

<a name="60"><font size='+2'><b>Neutrons within Atomic Nuclei</b></font></a><br><br>

The existence of FREE neutrons was established in the late 1920s.
As &quot;Atomic Weights&quot;, that is, the mass of atomic nuclei were determined
in coming years, it was found that most atomic nuclei had substantially
more mass than that of the specific number of (electrically charged)
protons and electrons that were necessary for the characteristics
of each nucleus and element.  It was ASSUMED that the nuclei also
contained specific numbers of neutrons, in order to account for the
needed extra mass.  Physics has accepted that assumption ever since
then.  Careful examination of modern precise values of atomic
masses seems to have now proven that assumption to have been
incorrect.  Instead of neutrons existing inside atomic nuclei,
there appear instead to be SEPARATE protons and electrons inside the
nuclei.  This difference seems to have extremely little change in
the characteristics of atomic nuclei, but it eliminates many
small errors in exact values of atomic mass.<p>

It also eliminates the need for massive numbers of neutrinos to
need to be created and absorbed by nuclear processes, and it seems
to also eliminate the need for a peculiar idea.  During the 1930s,
it was realized that mutual electrostatic repulsion of the closely-packed
protons inside each nucleus by Coulomb's Law of electrostatics, would
seem to immediately cause nearly all atomic nuclei to fly apart and
cease to exist.  Since it was known that most atomic nuclei are
extremely stable, the Physicists of the 1930s ASSUMED that there
was an &quot;extra force which existed&quot;, which became called the Strong
Nuclear Force.  The Strong was ASSUMED to be tremendously powerful
at small distances, in order to overcome the mutual repulsive forces
between the protons, to keep atomic nuclei from flying apart.  The
Strong was ASSUMED to have a distance dependence of either an
inverse-third-power or inverse-fifth-power effect, in order for it to
have the needed tremendous strength at tiny distances while not having any
detectable effects at greater (atomic) distances.  But NO experiment has
ever detected any actual evidence of any Strong Nuclear Force.  There
are only IMPLIED bits of evidence, all of which require various
assumptions of their own.<p>

In the late 1990s, I began to statistically examine the highly
respected NIST data regarding precise experimentally measured masses
of atomic nuclei, with the single intention of trying to determine
whether the Strong was actually an inverse-third-power or inverse-fifth-power
effect.  I had been troubled by noting that NO ONE ever seemed to try
to actually specify which was true, regarding such a basic characteristic
of such an important nuclear force!<p>

Like in many other scientific investigations, my statistical analysis
of the data surprised me in apparently showing that NEITHER was true,
and that, IF protons and electrons were moving around separately
within each atomic nucleus, the presence of the negatively charged
electrons provides ATTRACTIVE electrostatic effects on the protons
to keep them from flying out of the nucleus.  So the ASSUMED Strong
Nuclear Force appears to not even be necessary, or desirable, in
maintaining the stability of most atomic nuclei.  In fact, simple
geometric arrangements of the protons and electrons within atomic
nuclei seem to provide wonderfully obvious explanations for many
nuclear behaviors, without having to assume any Strong Nuclear Force,
or the existence of Pions within nuclei, or neutrinos.<p>

My statistical analysis of the NIST data has now convinced me that
there probably is NOT any Strong Nuclear Force, and likely no pions
or neutrinos INSIDE atomic nuclei.  Yes, pions and neutrinos exist
OUTSIDE of atomic nuclei, but much of the basic reasoning of
Nuclear Physics seems now to be entirely different than previously
ASSUMED.<p>

In recent decades, Physics seems to have abandoned any association
with actual reality, and instead come to be based entirely on
trying to solve immensely complex mathematical equations.  Unfortunately,
the mathematicians/physicists who try to solve such equations tend
to make their own ASSUMPTIONS in order to get solutions.  This situation
has resulted in Physicists feeling free to make totally outrageous
assumptions, and then solving some equations, and no one questions the
validity of their claims!  This has resulted in modern Physics having
come to be centered on an assortment of silly ideas.  The ideas are
safe from ever being disproven because they claim to describe objects
and processes which are so incredibly tiny that no (future) experiment
could ever detect any of them!  So String Theory, Super-Strings, Branes,
and an endless assortment of speculations have been dreamed up by
various Physicists in recent decades.  Since no possible experiment
could ever detect such tiny objects or processes, they are each free
to give as many lectures as they wish, with no possible challenge
to their claims.<p>

But all those speculative ideas were created as consequences of
assumptions that were speculative on their own, and much of these
areas of modern Physics are totally based on other earlier assumptions
which ARE definitely wrong!  No actual reality is even considered
any more, and Physicists simply argue over different sets of mathematical
equations!  And they get away with it because there is no one other
than Physicists who can have any clue what they are trying to talk
about!  So when some Physicist announces that there are 10 spatial
dimensions rather than the three we know about, no one questions such
a statement!  When another announces that there are 26 spatial dimensions,
again, there is no challenge!  This silliness is due to so many layers
of wild and speculative assumptions being stacked on other unsupported
assumptions that reality has lost the field!  It seems that rather
than Physicists needing to PROVE EVERY STATEMENT with brutal logic,
now Physics has devolved into admiring the one who makes the
most outrageous claims!  VERY disappointing to an &quot;actual&quot; Physicist!<p>

Once the Twins Paradox was totally accepted, then the Public started
extending that idea to &quot;Time Travel&quot;.  Countless Science-Fiction stories
have been published which are based on this idea.  But since the Twins
Paradox is absolutely wrong, having been based on really terrible
logic, and the two Twins would meet and see that they were both EXACTLY
the same age, the balloon of the idea of Time Travel pops!<p>

There ARE some very peculiar effects of Special Relativity and General
Relativity regarding some PERCEPTIONS of time, but the REALITY never
involves actual gain or loss of time, so NO Time Travel is possible!<p>

Some noted Physicists, including Kip Thorne, then dreamed up the
idea of Wormholes, which would allegedly be time conduits between two
distant locations in the Universe.  It is merely a variant on the
Time Travel idea, which is absolutely and totally untrue and impossible.<p>

This is beyond debate, once the error in the Twins Paradox is seen and
understood.<p>

<a name="64"><font size='+2'><b>Twins Paradox</b></font></a><br><br>

In the early 1960s, some Physicists did some really sloppy thinking
and they came up with a rather silly idea which later caught the
Public's interest, and it is now totally accepted, both within
Physics and by the public, even though the concept is totally wrong.
And it is wrong for trivially simple logical errors they made in
dreaming it up!  The Twins Paradox is a story about identical twin
brothers, one of whom stays on Earth while the other gets into a
spacecraft and zooms off into space at incredible speed, and then
when he later zooms back, the claim is that the elderly brother who
remained on Earth would meet a very young &quot;identical&quot; twin when he
returned.  This error arose due to the Physicists totally ignoring
one viewpoint and exclusively describing everything as it would
(allegedly) appear from Earth!  My web-page on this matter at
<a href="http://mb-soft.com/public2/twinspar.html">Twins Paradox of Relativity Is Absolutely Wrong</a>.  The errors and the explanation should be
simple enough that even schoolkids should be able to see what the correct
explanation is, and it does NOT involve gaining or losing years of age!<p>
