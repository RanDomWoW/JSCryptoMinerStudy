While some songs never got much further than the city limits others became international hits. Gerard Kenny&rsquo;s 1978 ode to his hometown <i>&lsquo;New York, New York - So Good They Named It Twice&rsquo;</i> spelled the re-birth of America&rsquo;s largest metropolis after it almost went bankrupt in 1975 and one year after a city-wide blackout shut it down for 25 hours. The song <i>&lsquo;If you're going to San Francisco, be sure to wear some flowers in your hair&rsquo;</i> sung by Scott McKenzie in 1967 became the anthem for the worldwide flower power movement. <a href="culture/songs_american_cities.html" target="_parent"><b>MORE</b></a><br>

It continues to say that corruption and misconduct by local government officials threaten fundamental decency in a society. America&rsquo;s<i> FBI,</i> which warns that public corruption poses a fundamental threat to national security and the US way of life, has over the past four decades investigated hundreds of elected officials, who used their positions to enrich themselves. Among those convicted are leaders of some of the largest US cities, including Detroit, New Orleans or Baltimore, but also many mayors from small-town America. <b><a href="politics/us-corrupt-mayors.html" target="_parent">MORE</a></b><br>

Urbanisation has already surpassed the 90-per-cent mark, not only in city states like Singapore and Kuwait, but also in Belgium, Venezuela, Uruguay, Argentina, Israel and the UK.

								Women have fought prejudice and struggled for equal rights and opportunities for hundreds of years. They did it with courage and resolve. In the 20th and early 21st centuries, women have achieved success in many spheres previously reserved to or monopolised by men, but their contributions are still often undervalued and their potential not recognised enough. Only some 20 per cent of the world&rsquo;s mayors are women.<br>
