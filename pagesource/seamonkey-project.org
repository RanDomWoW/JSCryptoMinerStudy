<h1>The SeaMonkey<sup>&reg;</sup> Project</h1>

<p>
The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to develop the SeaMonkey
all-in-one internet application suite (see below).
Such a software suite was previously made popular by Netscape and Mozilla,
and the SeaMonkey project continues to develop and deliver high-quality updates
to this concept. Containing an Internet browser, email &amp; newsgroup client
with an included web feed reader, HTML editor, IRC chat and web development
tools, SeaMonkey is sure to appeal to advanced users, web developers and
corporate users.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/" class="mozillapower"><img
 src="/images/powered_by_mozilla_small.png" height="31" width="122"
 alt="powered by Mozilla"></a>
Under the hood, SeaMonkey uses much of the same
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> source code which powers such
successful siblings as Firefox and Thunderbird.
Legal backing is provided by the
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/">Mozilla Foundation</a>.

<p><strong>Download problems with NoScript active</strong></p>

<p>
If you are using NoScript you might encounter a certificate error when trying
to download SeaMonkey from this site. NoScript tries to force an https
connection for an http only site. It is not a NoScript problem but how the
Mozilla server, from which downloads are delivered, is configured.
</p>
<p>
In this case please add download.cdn.mozilla.net to the NoScript
"Never force secure (HTTPS) connections" options or turn off NoScript for
this download only. The settings are located in the NoScript options under
"Advanced->HTTPS".

<h2>The SeaMonkey Suite</h2>
<p>
SeaMonkey has inherited the successful all-in-one concept of the original
Netscape Communicator and continues that product line based on the modern,
cross-platform architecture provided by the
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla project</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="doc/features#browser">Internet browser</a> at the core of
  the SeaMonkey suite uses the same rendering engine and application platform
  as its sibling Mozilla Firefox, with popular features like tabbed browsing,
  feed detection, popup blocking, smart location bar, find as you type
  and a lot of other functionality for a smooth web experience.</li>
<li>SeaMonkey's <a href="doc/features#mail">Mail and Newsgroups</a> client
  shares lots of code with Mozilla Thunderbird and features adaptive Junk mail
  filtering, tags and mail views, web feeds reading, tabbed messaging, multiple
  accounts, S/MIME, address books with LDAP support and is ready for both
  private and corporate use.</li>
<li>Additional components include an easy-to-use
  <a href="doc/features#composer">HTML Editor</a>, the ChatZilla IRC chat
  application and web development tools like a DOM Inspector and a JavaScript
  debugger.</li>
<li>If that's still not enough, SeaMonkey can be extended with numerous
  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/seamonkey/">Add-Ons</a> that provide
  additional functionality and customization for a complete Internet
  experience.</li>
</ul>
