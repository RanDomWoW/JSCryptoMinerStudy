<strong>FuturesBuilder.com is a property of Warpath Marketing, LLC.</strong><br>

This Privacy Policy covers Warpath Marketing, LLC's ("Warpath Marketing") treatment of personally identifiable information that Warpath Marketing collects when you agree to receive e-mail marketing from one of our partner websites. It is important that visitors are fully informed about the use of their personal information. Warpath Marketing believes in 100% permission-based marketing.<br>
<br>


This Privacy Policy also applies to consumers that have agreed to receive e-mail marketing from Warpath Marketing or our partner websites, via e-mail, third party partner websites, or otherwise. We may share or transfer the personal information that you supply to us, and we may work with other businesses to bring select retail opportunities to our users. These businesses may include, but are not limited to: a) providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation; (b) e-mail marketers; and (c) telemarketers.<br>
<br>


We may also employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate information from user lists, analyzing data, and providing marketing analysis. These agents have access to our users' personal information as needed to perform their functions for Warpath Marketing, but we do not permit them to use your personal information for any other purpose. 
<br>
<br>

Additionally, Warpath Marketing purchases and manages e-mail lists generated by affiliate websites and organizations. Users may remove themselves from a specific mailing list by utilizing the unsubscribe options that are present and available at the end of each e-mail that Warpath Marketing sends on behalf of the list owner. Unsubscribing from one list will not automatically unsubscribe a user from all lists.
<br>
<br>

You may unsubscribe from any of our e-mail marketing programs at any time. In every e-mail communication we send, there is an unsubscribe hyperlink that allows the recipient to unsubscribe from that specific marketing program by simply clicking the hyperlink provided and following the instructions provided. We attempt to process all unsubscribe requests in a prompt fashion. However, after unsubscribing, we cannot guarantee that you will never receive another mailing from us, because we may obtain your e-mail address in the future through a different e-mail marketing program that you have opted into. We can guarantee, however, that if you should ever receive another e-mail communication from Warpath Marketing, you will be able to remove your e-mail address via the unsubscribe hyperlink. Warpath Marketing is able to offer its free services, in part, based upon the willingness of our users to be contacted by our marketing partners, including affiliated third party advertisers. By allowing Warpath Marketing to make the information you supply available to our marketing partners, you will receive free product and service information that may be of interest to you. If you are a resident of the State of California and would like to opt-out from the disclosure of your personal information to any third party for direct marketing purposes, please complete this Contact Form.
