				<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>We've been quiet recently due to us being busy with other projects, but that's not to say we've not been working
    behind the scenes!</p>
<p>One new thing is, due to higher demand, we've recently (like 3 months ago) added a new master to s-ul (wac), so
    hopefully since then you've seen a boost in performance.<br/>
    We've also changed the way the caching system works recently too meaning bigger files will be faster to load on
    first access.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we've seen a massive rise in s-ul being abused for spreading malware and the likes, and as such, until
    we can figure out a permanent solution for protecting users against viruses and the like, the following file
    formats will not be downloadable by users: <code>.msi</code>, <code>.scr</code>, <code>.exe</code>, <code>.com</code>, <code>.jar</code>.<br/>
    Uploads for these files will still work, however downloads will be blocked and users will be greeted with a 404
    error.<br/>
    We didn't really want to have to do this but unfortunately there's not much else we can really do until we have a
    proper system in place.<br/>
    <br/>
    We hope you understand this and once we have an update on the way this system works, an update post will be made
    announcing the changes.
</p>
<p>Another thing we've been neglecting is support tickets (100% my fault, been extremely busy moving and keep forgetting
    to follow them up) so I'll get those wrapped up in the coming few days.
</p>
<p>We've got a few things on the TODO list such as restoring the ability to reset your API key on request (was a feature
    that we forgot to port over) and a few other things, so hopefully you'll get to see those soon. :)</p>
<p>As always, thanks for using s-ul!<br/>
    - Corin</p>			</div>

				<p>Hi all!<p>
<p>Apologies for the 1 hour of not being able to serve some files randomly, the issue was caused by changes we made last night to enable caching on the master (been disabled for a while so response times/download speeds were slightly slower).</p>
<p>Long story short, I forgot to add the cron job for the cache cleanup, causing the master to fill up and stop being able to cache newly requested files.</p>
<p>We had created a failsafe if this were to ever happen and to serve files directly from the slave as usual, however, unfotunately this failed so people were just greeted with an nginx 404 page.</p>
<p>All should be stable now however and we've fixed the failsafe in case this ever happens again.</p>
<p>Sorry for any inconvenience caused and thanks for using s-ul!</p>

				<p>Hi all!</p>

<p>Just a small anouncement for two new features and explain the three odd 10 minute downtimes that happened over the past few days.</p>

<p>For the downtime, short and sweet, it was literally DNS issues.<br />
For some reason the master couldn't resolve the slave using the DNS servers we had previously used for whatever reason.<br />
Upon changing them to Google DNS, they worked again and that was the end of that for the first two times.<br />
The third outage was caused by me being an idiot when fixing the nameserver issue properly, typoing the IP address in the server's interfaces file and rebooting networking.</p>

<p>This kills the s-ul.</p>

<p>As for the neato new features, we now have the much requested (but we kept forgetting to implement it) "Select All" action in Files.<br />
Took us two years to remember to do it but here we are.<br />
The other new feature is the addition of a dark theme which you can enable in the Preferences section of your Account page.</p>

<p>We'd also like to remind our users that no matter how desperate times get, we'll never remove hotlinking or implement tracking in our image serving.<br />
<del>We'd like to announce the third new feature however implement watermark ads that cover 99% of your images while charging a measly $500 per year to remove it!</del> :^)</p>

<p>Once again, thanks for using s-ul!<br />

<p>2 new updates to the site!</p>
<p>If you have ever bought credits for s-ul; along with being able to set an index and 404 page, you can now add custom domains via your Account settings!</p>

<p>Just go to your <a href="/account">Account</a> page, hit the "Domains" tab and add away!</p>

<p>The other update is you can now sort files by hit count. :)</p>

				<p>Quick update on two major things.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>The first: On July 1st, we will be deleting the old DNS record for n2.sys.s-ul.eu.</p>
		<p>For most, this will not affect you, however, <strong>if you use n2.sys.s-ul.eu to visit the website or in an old custom uploader config; from the 1st onwards you will not be able to view the site or upload files.</strong></p>
		<p>To mitigate this, please visit the site using https://s-ul.eu and either use the built in s-ul uploader in ShareX or update your custom uploader configs using the updated versions in your accounts.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The other major but not really major but still cool anyway thing is: Default directories are now fixed and settable.</p>

<br />
reCAPTCHA is now fixed on the contact form and on registration (that's what doing deploys at 11PM gets me).<br />
<br />
For smaller bugs, thanks to 2 users for pointing out that viewing a folder without a slug was broken and a would generate an extra / when uploaded to.<br />

We're aware that you're unable to change your default directory at the moment and are working to fix this.<br />

				Welcome to s-ul 2017!<br />
<br />
We've spent a long time working on it but it's here at last!<br />
We've switched from the ancient old framework (or rather lack of) to our inhouse one meaning we can make updates/upgrades a lot easier now, we've also decided to deviate a little from the old teased screenshots!<br />
<br />
Please note, if you used a custom domain, you will need to update it from an <strong>A</strong> record to a <strong>CNAME</strong> record and point it to <code>no-ssl.sys.s-ul.eu</code>.<br />
If you do not do this, <strong>your files will be inaccessible.</strong><br />
<br />
Please note also that your thumbnails may not exist yet, this is because thumbnails are still generating in the background (around about 1M to go as of 23:37BST).<br />
<br />
While this is all new and shiny, there will be bugs here and there so if you do encounter any, please let us know via the <a href="/contact">contact form</a> and we'll get it fixed ASAP.<br />
<br />
s-ul now uses a master/slave type system so things might be slow for now.<br />
We're monitoring this to make sure it doesn't get too bad but right now we're guaging the amount of usage before we deploy more masters but as of now, it's just Nekomata (Master) and Nagisa (Slave).<br />
<br />
With this also, a lot of old small silly bugs/missing features were implemented and/or fixed, such as being unable to change your email address (I only realised this was missing after it was pointed out a few months ago), being unable to delete directories and being unable to register using an email address with a + in it.<br />
<br />
All in all, we hope you enjoy using s-ul 2017 as much as we did building it. :)<br />

				<p>Hi all! New version time again along with a huge news post!</p>

<p>With this version comes payments and a load of UI changes.</p>

<p>Hopefully everyone finds the UI changes to their liking. Things that were here before are still here now however
they should now all be under the "account" menu option.</p>

<p>We're using a credit based system as virtual currency allows us to make plans cheaper and lower the amount of code required to make it all tick along nicely (like upgrade refunding handling, downgrade handling and so on).</p>

<p>We've priced plans and credits to what we feel is fair. With s-ul we've always had a quality over quantity mindset, and if we were to offer things like unlimited storage we'd have to sacrifice a lot in terms of stability, performance and other things.</p>

<p>Fear not though, everything will continue to work how it all worked before, the initial GB you get from signing up is free and always will be.</p>

<p>If you have had your capacity boosted by another member of staff before, you will retain that boost even if you upgrade/downgrade.</p>

<p>One thing I forgot to announce before is that the file manager now has a search feature to easily search for files.</p>

<p> It searches against the original name you submitted the file with and is a LIKE search, meaning if you want to look for all mp3's in your account, all you have to enter is "mp3".</p>

<p> We have also now added a Terms of Service to the website, please review it <a href="/tos.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>Your continued use of the service will signify that you have read and agree to our ToS.</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy using this version of s-ul as much as we have building it.</p>

<p>Please don't forget to follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/seionupload" target="_blank">@seionupload</a>.</p>

<p>As always if you have any questions, please feel free to send us a message via the <a href="/contact.php">contact form</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you everyone for being a part of s-ul. :)</p>
