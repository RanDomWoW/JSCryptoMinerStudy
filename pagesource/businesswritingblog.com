</h3><!-- .entry-header -->

<div class="entry-content">

<input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" value="" />

<div class="entry-body">
    <p>Do you use the abbreviations&#0160;<em>i.e.&#0160;</em>and&#0160;<em>e.g.&#0160;</em>in your business writing? Do you use them interchangeably, or does each expression have its place? How would you define them if a child asked you what they meant?&#0160;</p>
<p>To think about how to use&#0160;<em>e.g.&#0160;</em>and&#0160;<em>i.e.,&#0160;</em>choose the correct abbreviation in these examples:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. We need an HR professional who is knowledgeable on a variety of topics, <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>i.e./e.g,</strong>&#0160;</span>leadership, succession planning, supervision, and training.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Let&#39;s start the program with an icebreaker, <strong>i.e./e.g.,</strong> an activity that will loosen people up.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. My friend is vacationing in three countries I have never visited, <strong>i.e./e.g.,</strong>&#0160;Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. He has much to do to prepare the condo for sale, <strong>i.e./e.g.,</strong> painting, redoing the floors, and replacing several light&#0160;fixtures.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">5. He is an expert in 360-degree feedback, <strong>i.e./e.g.,</strong>&#0160;feedback that involves input from supervisors, peers, and direct reports.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">6. We have not yet received comments from several professors,&#0160;<strong>i.e./e.g,</strong>&#0160;Melanie Danny and Charlene Rose.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#0160;</p>
<p>Have you decided on your choices? Review them again, but this time replace&#0160;<em>i.e.&#0160;</em>with &quot;that is,&quot; and replace&#0160;<em>e.g.&#0160;</em>with &quot;for example.&quot; See whether doing so changes your answers.&#0160;</p>
<p>People often confuse&#0160;<em>i.e.&#0160;</em>and&#0160;<em>e.g.&#0160;</em>because they don&#39;t know what the abbreviations mean. Here&#39;s what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I.e.&#0160;</em>comes from the Latin <em>id est</em>. It means &quot;that is.&quot;&#0160;</li>
<li><em>E.g.&#0160;</em>comes from the Latin&#0160;<em>exempli gratia.&#0160;</em>It means &quot;for example.&quot;&#0160;</li>
<li>The expressions are not interchangeable.&#0160;<em>E.g.&#0160;</em>communicates that you are providing a mere example or examples.&#0160; <em>I.e.&#0160;</em>communicates that you are identifying or explaining--not giving an example.&#0160;</li>
</ul>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Let&#39;s look again at the six examples.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. We need an HR professional who is knowledgeable on a variety of topics, <strong>that is,</strong> leadership, succession planning, supervision, and training.&#0160;<br />OR<br />1. We need an HR professional who is knowledgeable on a variety of topics, <strong>for example,</strong> leadership, succession planning, supervision, and training.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Both could be correct, but they mean different things. The writer should decide on the intended meaning and then use &quot;that is&quot; or &quot;for example&quot; to be clear.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Let&#39;s start the program with an icebreaker, that is, an activity that will loosen people up.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">This sentence requires &quot;that is&quot; because it is explaining what an icebreaker is.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. My friend is vacationing in three countries I have never visited,&#0160;<strong>that is,</strong>&#0160;Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">This sentence requires &quot;that is&quot; because it is naming the three countries in question.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. He has much to do to prepare the condo for sale, <strong>that&#0160;is,</strong> painting, redoing the floors, and replacing several light&#0160;fixtures.&#0160;<br />OR<br />4. He has much to do to prepare the condo for sale, <strong>for example,</strong> painting, redoing the floors, and replacing several light&#0160;fixtures.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Both &quot;that is&quot; and &quot;for example&quot; are possible, but &quot;for example&quot; is the better choice. There must be more than three things the individual needs to do to prepare the condo for sale; therefore, the three tasks are examples.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#0160;5. He is an expert in 360-degree feedback, <strong>that is,</strong>&#0160;feedback that involves input from supervisors, peers, and direct reports.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">The sentence requires &quot;that is&quot; because it is explaining what 360-degree feedback is.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">6.&#0160;We have not yet received comments from several professors,&#0160;<strong>for example,</strong>&#0160;Dr. Danny and Mr. Rose.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">This sentence needs &quot;for example&quot; because it refers to several professors but only names two examples.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&#0160;</p>
<p>From the examples above, you can see that using&#0160;<em>i.e.&#0160;</em>and&#0160;<em>e.g.&#0160;</em>is risky. The abbreviations aren&#39;t clear to many people, and they make readers think about whether you are providing an&#0160;explanation or an example. Using &quot;that is&quot; and &quot;for example&quot; makes things clear.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s smart to be concise and avoid using &quot;that is&quot; and &quot;for example&quot;<em>&#0160;</em>when they aren&#39;t necessary. These sentences communicate well without them:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. We need an HR professional who is knowledgeable on a variety of topics: leadership, succession planning, supervision, and training.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Let&#39;s start the program with <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">an icebreaker,</span> an activity that will loosen people up.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. My friend is vacationing in three countries I have never visited: Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. He has much to do to prepare the condo for sale: painting, redoing the floors, replacing several light&#0160;fixtures, etc.&#0160;</p>
<p>Notice the addition of&#0160;<em>etc.&#0160;</em>in the sentence above. That only works when &quot;for example&quot; doesn&#39;t appear. It&#39;s illogical to use <em>etc.&#0160;</em>and &quot;for example&quot; together.&#0160;</p>
<p>Do you use the risky&#0160;<em>i.e.&#0160;</em>and&#0160;<em>e.g.</em>&#0160;at work?<em>&#0160;</em>Do you use them correctly?&#0160;</p>

                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Do you use the abbreviations&#0160;<em>i.e.&#0160;</em>and&#0160;<em>e.g.&#0160;</em>in your business writing? Do you use them interchangeably, or does each expression have its place? How would you define them if a child asked you what they meant?&#0160;</p>
<p>To think about how to use&#0160;<em>e.g.&#0160;</em>and&#0160;<em>i.e.,&#0160;</em>choose the correct abbreviation in these examples:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. We need an HR professional who is knowledgeable on a variety of topics, <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>i.e./e.g,</strong>&#0160;</span>leadership, succession planning, supervision, and training.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Let&#39;s start the program with an icebreaker, <strong>i.e./e.g.,</strong> an activity that will loosen people up.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. My friend is vacationing in three countries I have never visited, <strong>i.e./e.g.,</strong>&#0160;Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. He has much to do to prepare the condo for sale, <strong>i.e./e.g.,</strong> painting, redoing the floors, and replacing several light&#0160;fixtures.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">5. He is an expert in 360-degree feedback, <strong>i.e./e.g.,</strong>&#0160;feedback that involves input from supervisors, peers, and direct reports.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">6. We have not yet received comments from several professors,&#0160;<strong>i.e./e.g,</strong>&#0160;Melanie Danny and Charlene Rose.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#0160;</p>
<p>Have you decided on your choices? Review them again, but this time replace&#0160;<em>i.e.&#0160;</em>with &quot;that is,&quot; and replace&#0160;<em>e.g.&#0160;</em>with &quot;for example.&quot; See whether doing so changes your answers.&#0160;</p>
<p>People often confuse&#0160;<em>i.e.&#0160;</em>and&#0160;<em>e.g.&#0160;</em>because they don&#39;t know what the abbreviations mean. Here&#39;s what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I.e.&#0160;</em>comes from the Latin <em>id est</em>. It means &quot;that is.&quot;&#0160;</li>
<li><em>E.g.&#0160;</em>comes from the Latin&#0160;<em>exempli gratia.&#0160;</em>It means &quot;for example.&quot;&#0160;</li>
<li>The expressions are not interchangeable.&#0160;<em>E.g.&#0160;</em>communicates that you are providing a mere example or examples.&#0160; <em>I.e.&#0160;</em>communicates that you are identifying or explaining--not giving an example.&#0160;</li>
</ul>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Let&#39;s look again at the six examples.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. We need an HR professional who is knowledgeable on a variety of topics, <strong>that is,</strong> leadership, succession planning, supervision, and training.&#0160;<br />OR<br />1. We need an HR professional who is knowledgeable on a variety of topics, <strong>for example,</strong> leadership, succession planning, supervision, and training.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Both could be correct, but they mean different things. The writer should decide on the intended meaning and then use &quot;that is&quot; or &quot;for example&quot; to be clear.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Let&#39;s start the program with an icebreaker, that is, an activity that will loosen people up.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">This sentence requires &quot;that is&quot; because it is explaining what an icebreaker is.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. My friend is vacationing in three countries I have never visited,&#0160;<strong>that is,</strong>&#0160;Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">This sentence requires &quot;that is&quot; because it is naming the three countries in question.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. He has much to do to prepare the condo for sale, <strong>that&#0160;is,</strong> painting, redoing the floors, and replacing several light&#0160;fixtures.&#0160;<br />OR<br />4. He has much to do to prepare the condo for sale, <strong>for example,</strong> painting, redoing the floors, and replacing several light&#0160;fixtures.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Both &quot;that is&quot; and &quot;for example&quot; are possible, but &quot;for example&quot; is the better choice. There must be more than three things the individual needs to do to prepare the condo for sale; therefore, the three tasks are examples.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#0160;5. He is an expert in 360-degree feedback, <strong>that is,</strong>&#0160;feedback that involves input from supervisors, peers, and direct reports.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">The sentence requires &quot;that is&quot; because it is explaining what 360-degree feedback is.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">6.&#0160;We have not yet received comments from several professors,&#0160;<strong>for example,</strong>&#0160;Dr. Danny and Mr. Rose.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">This sentence needs &quot;for example&quot; because it refers to several professors but only names two examples.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&#0160;</p>
<p>From the examples above, you can see that using&#0160;<em>i.e.&#0160;</em>and&#0160;<em>e.g.&#0160;</em>is risky. The abbreviations aren&#39;t clear to many people, and they make readers think about whether you are providing an&#0160;explanation or an example. Using &quot;that is&quot; and &quot;for example&quot; makes things clear.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s smart to be concise and avoid using &quot;that is&quot; and &quot;for example&quot;<em>&#0160;</em>when they aren&#39;t necessary. These sentences communicate well without them:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. We need an HR professional who is knowledgeable on a variety of topics: leadership, succession planning, supervision, and training.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Let&#39;s start the program with <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">an icebreaker,</span> an activity that will loosen people up.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. My friend is vacationing in three countries I have never visited: Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. He has much to do to prepare the condo for sale: painting, redoing the floors, replacing several light&#0160;fixtures, etc.&#0160;</p>
<p>Notice the addition of&#0160;<em>etc.&#0160;</em>in the sentence above. That only works when &quot;for example&quot; doesn&#39;t appear. It&#39;s illogical to use <em>etc.&#0160;</em>and &quot;for example&quot; together.&#0160;</p>
<p>Do you use the risky&#0160;<em>i.e.&#0160;</em>and&#0160;<em>e.g.</em>&#0160;at work?<em>&#0160;</em>Do you use them correctly?&#0160;</p>

                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Reading yesterday&#39;s&#0160;<em>New York Times,&#0160;</em>I came upon the word <em>polymath,&#0160;</em>and I couldn&#39;t confidently determine its meaning from the context. Can you define the word? Here&#39;s how&#0160;<em>The&#0160;NYT&#0160;</em>used it:&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The debut season of &quot;Atlanta,&quot; the FX series created by the polymath Donald Glover, will probably be remembered for its most ambitious, inexplicable gags. . . .</p>
<p>Decide on your definition before scrolling down for my thoughts.&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><img alt="Polymath" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c02a553ef01b8d2dffe0d970c image-full img-responsive" src="http://www.businesswritingblog.com/.a/6a00d8341c02a553ef01b8d2dffe0d970c-800wi" title="Polymath" /></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>The context doesn&#39;t help much, does it? Many nouns could come before Donald Glover&#39;s name, for example,&#0160;<em>writer</em>,&#0160;<em>actor</em>, <em>entertainer, rapper, comedian, </em>or<em> record producer.&#0160;</em></p>
<p>It turns out that that&#39;s the point: Glover (who is also known as Childish Gambino in the music industry) is a man with all those talents. The word&#0160;<em>polymath&#0160;</em>means &quot;a person of encyclopedic learning,&quot; according to&#0160;<em>Merriam Webster&#39;s Collegiate Dictionary,</em>&#0160;and &quot;a person of great or varied learning,&quot; according to&#0160;<em>The American Heritage College Dictionary</em>.&#0160;<em>Canadian Oxford Dictionary</em>&#0160;adds the definition &quot;a great scholar.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to add&#0160;<em>polymath&#0160;</em>to my working vocabulary. It&#39;s a perfect replacement for the phrase &quot;Renaissance man,&quot; and there&#39;s no good synonym for it.&#0160;</p>
<p>Did you know the word <em>polymath&#0160;</em>before reading this blog post? Where did you learn it?</p>
<p>Spread the word!&#0160;</p>

                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I got an email yesterday from the organizers of a literary festival I&#39;m going to attend. It shared reminders about parking and registration. I knew where to park, but I needed to know where registration was. So I went directly to this paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>REGISTRATION</strong><br /><strong>Attendees are required to check in at the main lobby of the Engineering building (see map).</strong> You will receive a wristband . . . .&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I looked at the map to find the Engineering building. Can you find it?&#0160;</p>
<p>Keep looking until you figure out where the Engineering building is, and then scroll down to my comments.&#0160;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://www.businesswritingblog.com/.a/6a00d8341c02a553ef01b8d2dcf7d7970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Engineering" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c02a553ef01b8d2dcf7d7970c image-full img-responsive" src="http://www.businesswritingblog.com/.a/6a00d8341c02a553ef01b8d2dcf7d7970c-800wi" title="Engineering" /></a></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Did you identify the Engineering building? Silly me--I could not find it. So I wrote a quick email to the organizers and asked which building was Engineering.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here is the helpful reply I received:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Lynn,</p>
<p>The Engineering building is located on the lower mall near the 12<sup>th</sup> &amp; E Columbia entrance across from the law school. Please also see the map in the email. Engineering is marked as “Registration.”</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any other questions. Thank you!</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it was impossible to find Engineering by looking for it. I should have been looking for &quot;Registration,&quot; which is clearly flagged twice.&#0160;</p>
<p>How would you rewrite the sentence of instruction so that someone who is reading quickly and does not know the campus would find the correct building on the map? Please share your revision in the comments.&#0160;</p>

<p><strong>Addendum on February 24</strong></p>
<p>Once I got there, it was easy to find the place to register:&#0160;</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://www.businesswritingblog.com/.a/6a00d8341c02a553ef01b7c951b19f970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Pokemon" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c02a553ef01b7c951b19f970b image-full img-responsive" src="http://www.businesswritingblog.com/.a/6a00d8341c02a553ef01b7c951b19f970b-800wi" title="Pokemon" /></a></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&quot;Your opponent puts a card from <strong>his&#0160;or her </strong>hand on the bottom of&#0160;<strong>his or her&#0160;</strong>deck.&quot; That&#39;s just too many inelegant possessive forms.</p>
<p>Having taught business writing at Nintendo, the creators of Pokémon, I know how much the company values flawless writing. So it didn&#39;t surprise me that it would use that correct form. Yes, <em>his or her</em>&#0160;is correct the way the card uses it. The singular word&#0160;<em>opponent </em>traditionally&#0160;needs a singular pronoun.&#0160;</p>
<p>But today, that correct rendering is outdated. <em>They</em> and <em>their&#0160;</em>have won out over <em>he or she</em>&#0160;and <em>his or her--</em>at least in awkward sentences like that one.&#0160;</p>
<p>Let&#39;s write it this way:&#0160;&quot;Your opponent puts a card from their hand on the bottom of&#0160;their deck.&quot; Granted, if you have just one opponent--and you are a grammarian--the plural&#0160;<em>their&#0160;</em>will make you cringe. But you have to admit that it&#39;s perfectly clear--just not what you were expecting.&#0160;</p>
<p>I had to acknowledge something I wasn&#39;t expecting in the excellent book&#0160;<em>When They Call You a Terrorist: A Black Lives Matter Memoir.&#0160;</em>In it, Patrisse Khan-Cullors refers to her partner Future as&#0160;<em>they,&#0160;</em>and each time I read it, the singular <em>they </em>threw&#0160;me off balance. Here&#39;s an example: &quot;Future told me about their childhood. They have a sister who is their twin&#0160;and a brother.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p><em>They</em> threw me off balance, but it made&#0160;me recognize and appreciate that gender-based pronouns don&#39;t serve everyone.&#0160;</p>
<p><em>The Washington Post</em>&#0160;weighed in on this issue back in 2015: “Allowing <em>they</em> for a gender-nonconforming person is a no-brainer. And once we’ve done that, why not allow it for the most awkward of those <em>he </em>or<em> she</em> situations that have troubled us for so many years?” Awkward like the text on the Pokémon card.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve reported before on <a href="http://www.businesswritingblog.com/business_writing/2017/10/things-changed-is-your-style-guide-up-to-date.html">where style guides stand on the singular <em>they</em></a>&#0160;(Number 5 in the article).&#0160;How about you? Do you use it to avoid clumsy <em>his or her</em> constructions? Are you now accustomed to seeing and using <em>they</em> for&#0160;gender-nonconforming individuals? Does your company style guide address using <em>they&#0160;</em>and&#0160;<em>their</em>&#0160;for&#0160;singular pronouns? Please share your experience.&#0160;</p>

                                <p>I traveled (travelled?) around the Big Island of Hawaii the last two weeks and found that--even at Volcanoes National Park--I could not escape thinking about writing. This text grabbed my attention on the Sulphur Banks trail:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://www.businesswritingblog.com/.a/6a00d8341c02a553ef01b8d2d99e1f970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Sulfur sulphur 1" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c02a553ef01b8d2d99e1f970c image-full img-responsive" src="http://www.businesswritingblog.com/.a/6a00d8341c02a553ef01b8d2d99e1f970c-800wi" title="Sulfur sulphur 1" /></a></p>
<p>It appeared on this large, instructive sign:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://www.businesswritingblog.com/.a/6a00d8341c02a553ef01b8d2d99e3b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Sulfur sulphur 2" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c02a553ef01b8d2d99e3b970c image-full img-responsive" src="http://www.businesswritingblog.com/.a/6a00d8341c02a553ef01b8d2d99e3b970c-800wi" title="Sulfur sulphur 2" /></a></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Why deal with spelling in a national park? Because on the Sulphur Banks trail, the park needed to explain the nature of&#0160;<em>sulfur.</em></p>
<p>When you think about whether to use U.S., British, or Canadian spellings, think about your audience. When I offer classes in nearby Vancouver, British Columbia, I always update spellings, and I consider using the word&#0160;<em>brackets&#0160;</em>for what I normally call&#0160;<em>parentheses.&#0160;</em></p>
<p>This <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/spelling/british-and-spelling">Oxford dictionaries&#0160;page</a> can help you with the basics, and this <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/usage/british-and-american-terms">list covers most spelling differences</a>--although not <em>sulphur</em> and <em>sulfur</em>. For Canada, a gray area (or grey?) when it comes to choosing between&#0160;U.S. or British spelling, I consult <em><a href="http://www.thecanadianpress.com/writing-guides/canadian-press-caps-spelling/">The Canadian Press Caps and Spelling</a></em> guide.&#0160;</p>
<p>One word is always spelled the same way: the Hawaiian word and feeling of&#0160;<em>aloha.&#0160;</em></p>

                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The other day at my health club I asked an employee what time the bank parking lot was available for club members&#39; use. I knew I could use the bank lot when the bank closed, but I wasn&#39;t sure what time that was. The employee responded, &quot;You&#39;ll have to ask at the bank.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>The health club has arranged with the bank for club members to use the parking lot. Why wouldn&#39;t the club employee want to know about the closing time herself? Why make individual club members find out from the bank?&#0160;</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t give any flak to the employee because I&#39;m trying to spread joy rather than annoyance. Instead, I thought about how the situation relates to writing. How can people avoid coming across as uninterested and instead take the next step for their readers? Below are a few ideas I thought of. Please add yours.&#0160;</p>
<p>If someone:&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Asks for something and you aren&#39;t the right person to provide it, forward the email to the person who can. But before forwarding, make sure there&#39;s nothing in the original email that the writer would not want forwarded. &#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Emails a question and you can&#39;t answer it now, reply anyway. Let them know when you will have the information, so they don&#39;t have to worry that you didn&#39;t get the message.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Will need to schedule a meeting with you, email suggested meeting times rather than waiting for them to do it. If you work with them, add the meeting to their calendar.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Needs to take a step forward on a project, offer suggestions of next steps instead of just asking &quot;What do you want to do?&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">5. Wants to connect with an associate of yours, don&#39;t just provide the person&#39;s email. Introduce them by&#0160;email to make the job easier for both of them. Read <a href="http://www.businesswritingblog.com/business_writing/2017/01/how-to-introduce-two-people-in-writing-.html" title="Read Lynn&#39;s blog post">How to Introduce Two People in Writing</a> for tips and examples.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">6. Needs information from a website, give them a specific link within the site, not just to the home page.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">7. Needs an answer from you--and your answer is no--reply promptly. Don&#39;t make them ask again. Here are tips on <a href="http://www.businesswritingblog.com/business_writing/2005/12/how_to_say_no.html" title="Read the blog post">How to Say No</a>.</p>
<p>Can you think of other ways to make life easier for readers? If you share them, you may make life easier for readers around the world.&#0160;</p>
<p>This week a Vogue.com article <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/situational-work-email-etiquette" title="Read the VOGUE article">&quot;How to Send Stern Work Emails Without Burning Bridges&quot;</a> featured some of my ideas. Check it out!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The other day my fitness coach went online to pay a $250 deposit on her daughter&#39;s high school trip. She found the website and the correct trip, clicked the link to pay $250, and then faced a cell marked <strong>Amount</strong>. In a hurry, she typed <strong>250</strong>,<strong>&#0160;</strong>the amount of her payment,&#0160;without thinking much about it.</p>
<p>Only when she finalized the transaction by clicking&#0160;<strong>Pay</strong> did the total appear. My coach&#39;s credit card was charged $62,500. Yes, $62,500! And her credit card company immediately approved the charge.&#0160;</p>
<p>What went wrong? When the coach saw&#0160;<strong>Amount</strong>, even though she thought the blank was redundant, she typed <strong>250</strong>. After all, that was the amount she needed to pay. But as a result, she paid $250 an extraordinary 250 times.&#0160;</p>
<p>The word <em>amount<strong>&#0160;</strong></em>led&#0160;the customer-coach in the wrong direction.&#0160;<em>Quantity&#0160;</em>would have helped her understand what the blank needed.&#0160;How many (what quantity of) payments in the amount of $250 did she want to make? Just one.</p>
<p><em>Amount&#0160;</em>and&#0160;<em>quantity&#0160;</em>may be interchangeable in some references to money, for example: &quot;The amount [quantity] of money we need to invest has increased.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>However, I follow&#0160;<em>The Chicago Manual of Style</em>&#39;s guidance on the word&#0160;<em>amount: &quot;</em><em>Amount</em> is used with mass [not countable] nouns: a decrease in the amount of pollution; a small amount of money&quot; (like the amount of her payment).&#0160;</p>
<p>Following that advice, the website would not have used&#0160;<em>amount&#0160;</em>for the countable payments but rather&#0160;<em>quantity&#0160;</em>or&#0160;<em>number.&#0160;</em>It would not have caused my coach the hassle of canceling the $62,500 charge.&#0160;</p>
<p>Have unexpected words on websites cost you time or money? Please share your story.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Do people tell you that your writing is choppy or difficult to follow? Do they say it doesn&#39;t flow?</p>
<p>Or maybe you&#39;ve noticed that your team&#39;s writing doesn&#39;t flow.&#0160;</p>
<p>Good flow in writing is method, not magic. When writing doesn&#39;t flow, it&#39;s missing certain elements that help to guide and focus readers. Good flow comes from using those elements in your writing.&#0160;</p>
<p>Use a combination of the elements below, or encourage your team of writers to use them. Then notice those complaints about &quot;lack of flow&quot; disappear, and watch for an improvement in readers&#39; responses.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>1. Transitional words and phrases.</strong> Transitional expressions such as &quot;also,&quot; &quot;in comparison,&quot; and &quot;as a result&quot; help guide readers down the path your ideas take. Think of such expressions as signposts pointing readers in the right direction, especially when your message changes course slightly. These expressions are essential in speeches and presentations, where the audience needs cues to help them follow your ideas. Transitional expressions I use often are &quot;however,&quot; &quot;in contrast,&quot; and &quot;for example.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>2. Bullets points and enumerated lists.</strong> Lists of like things (such as steps, benefits, reasons, and requirements) help readers quickly recognize similar content. For instance, a list of 20 executives and their titles is much easier to follow than a paragraph of 20 execs&#39; names and accompanying titles. Also, when you use lists, you do not have to work hard to show relationships between ideas. You can leave out transitional expressions such as &quot;First of all,&quot; &quot;Secondly,&quot; etc.</p>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong> Be sure to structure every item in your list the same way (for instance, all sentences, all noun phrases, or all items starting with action verbs), or your readers will have to work to find similarities.</p>
<p><strong>3. Headings.</strong> Without headings, readers have to figure out the relationships between the various parts of your message. With headings, readers can scan your content quickly, recognizing the flow of ideas. Specific headings, such as &quot;Benefits: Less Cost, Greater Efficiency&quot; and &quot;Proposed Solution: Centralize the Training Function,&quot; give readers instant information. They do more to guide readers than general headings such as &quot;Benefits&quot; and &quot;Proposed Solution.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>4. Answers to readers&#39; questions</strong>. Readers are looking for answers to their questions. Before you write, think about what your readers want to know. Then provide that information in the order they are likely to want it, so it flows to meet their needs. For instance, if you are instituting a change, readers&#39; first questions are likely to be:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">• What is the change?<br />• Why is it being made?<br />• When does it go into effect?</p>
<p>Writers often want to give background first. But the first thing your readers want is the main point of your message, along with the answers to their burning questions.</p>
<p><strong>5. One purpose per message.</strong> Readers get lost in communications that pull them in different directions. Whenever possible, have just one purpose in writing and one focus. For example, if you are inviting vendors to participate in an information fair, do not mention other events or other ways to get involved. If you are announcing a change, do not bring up other changes, and do not thank the team that is implementing the change. The other changes, as well as the thank-you, will be the focus of separate future messages.</p>
<p><strong>6. One idea per paragraph.</strong> If you pack a paragraph with more than one idea, readers will have difficulty following your flow because of the competing information. In an email announcing a presentation, for example, use three separate paragraphs to communicate the presentation topic; the date, time, and place of the event; and the presenter&#39;s brief bio. Headings will help the information stand out.</p>
<p><strong>7. One idea per sentence.</strong> A sentence with more than one idea is a sentence competing with itself. The two or three ideas in such a sentence are competing for the readers&#39; attention. Rather than having an easy time following the flow of the sentence, readers don&#39;t know where to focus. Even a short sentence like this one pulls its readers in two directions: &quot;Thank you for your help and see you next week at the conference.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>8. Complete sentences.</strong> Sentence fragments create work for readers, who have to fill in the missing words to follow the flow. The fragment &quot;Got to see the latest design!&quot; can mean the writer got to see the design or the reader ought to see it. The incomplete question &quot;Payment due next week?&quot; can raise many questions for readers.</p>
<p><strong>9. Varied sentence length.</strong> Short, concise sentences are easy for readers to follow. However, a parade of very short sentences may come across as disjointed. Varying the length of your sentences will contribute to a smooth flow. The sentences in the paragraph just above are 9, 18, 24, and 13 words long. The previous paragraph has sentences of 13, 15, 19, and 26 words. Try to keep all sentences shorter than 35 words, so readers can follow them easily, and vary the length for smooth flow.</p>
<p><strong>10. Varied sentence structure.</strong> Simple subject-verb-object sentences make the readers&#39; job easier. (The sentence you just read is an example.) But they may become monotonous and cause readers to lose focus. Varying your sentence structure means occasionally breaking out of the mold of simple sentences. Try these sentence variations:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">• Use a dependent clause followed by the main clause: <br />&#0160; &#0160;&quot;If you need help, call Marcia or Devon.&quot; <br />• Use a main clause followed by a dependent clause: <br />&#0160; &#0160;&quot;I will call you next week after I talk with the client.&quot; <br />• Start with a verb phrase: <br />&#0160; &#0160;&quot;To find the solution, click this link.&quot; <br />• Start with a prepositional phrase or phrases: <br />&#0160; &#0160;&quot;By the way, her manager agrees.&quot;<br />&#0160; &#0160;&quot;In the minutes of the meeting, he listed the action steps.&quot;<br />• Combine two short sentences into a compound sentence: <br />&#0160; &#0160;&quot;I called Dr. Mann, and we discussed the retreat agenda.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Read your email, newsletter article, or report aloud. If it sounds singsongy, as though you are reading a rhyming poem, you need to increase your sentence variety. Also, if you notice the same phrase or word repeating at the beginning of sentences, vary your sentence structure to reduce that repetition. For instance, these three 8-word sentences are too repetitive:</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The other day I was reading a movie review, and a character in the film was described twice as <em>redoubtable</em>. Before you read on, answer this question: What does&#0160;<em>redoubtable&#0160;</em>mean?&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Need some help? So did I. I had no idea what <em>redoubtable</em> meant. And I&#39;m an&#0160;English major, business writing expert, and someone who looks up every word she doesn&#39;t know.&#0160;</p>
<p>I decided to text a dozen of my friends and relatives to find out whether I was alone in my ignorance. Three said they had no idea. Here&#39;s what the others came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doubting again&#0160; WRONG&#0160;</li>
<li>Given to doubt, wishy-washy&#0160; WRONG</li>
<li>Renewable&#0160; WRONG</li>
<li>Dishonest&#0160; WRONG</li>
<li>Beyond doubt&#0160; WRONG&#0160;</li>
<li>Untrustworthy&#0160; WRONG</li>
<li>Suspicious&#0160; WRONG</li>
<li>Defensible&#0160; WRONG</li>
<li>Renowned, capable&#0160; MAYBE</li>
</ul>
<p>One of my friends said she might be able to guess the word from the context. Good point! Here&#39;s the context:&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">On a photo caption: &quot;Daisy Ridley returns as the redoubtable Rey in &#39;Star Wars: The Last Jedi,&#39; the eighth film in the franchise.&quot;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In the movie review: &quot;. . . the redoubtable Rey (Daisy Ridley) comes face to face with Mark Hamill&#39;s long-missing Luke Skywalker.&quot;</p>
<p>The context gave me no help. How about you?&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><em>The American Heritage College Dictionary&#0160;</em>defines&#0160;<em>redoubtable&#0160;</em>this way:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. arousing fear or awe; formidable.&#0160;<br />2. worthy of respect or honor.&#0160;</p>
<p><em>Merriam-Webster&#39;s Collegiate Dictionary,&#0160;</em>11th Edition, says this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. causing fear or alarm, formidable.<br />2. illustrious, eminent, worthy of respect.&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s time for writers to stop using obscure words that their readers--in this case, readers of&#0160;<em>The Seattle Times</em>--don&#39;t recognize. Even the GRE exam no longer tests knowledge of obscure vocabulary. Why would a newspaper use them?&#0160;</p>
<p>People don&#39;t read movie reviews for vocabulary development unless they are trying to learn English. And&#0160;<em>redoubtable&#0160;</em>would not have helped ESL learners.</p>
<p>How about you? If you have seen <em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi </em>(or&#0160;<em>The Force Awakens</em>), how would you describe&#0160;Rey? I&#39;m guessing the writer might have used <em>formidable</em> or <em>illustrious</em>. The word <em>awesome</em>, inspiring awe, might have been the perfect word if it hadn&#39;t already been used to describe everything from the full moon to clean laundry.&#0160;</p>
<p>Writers, know your audience. And know why they are reading your work.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
                <input type="hidden" name="zemanta-related" val="" />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Imagine this scenario: You got approval and budget to attend a four-day work-related conference. You&#39;re back now, and your boss says, in passing, &quot;I&#39;d like a report on the conference. Can you get it to me by tomorrow at 2? I want to share highlights with our VP.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p>Your mind is still swimming in an ocean of conference details and experiences. What should you put in the report?&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>This scenario captures the experience of a woman--let&#39;s call her Victoria--in a writing class I led. Victoria showed me the report she had created: around six pages of single-spaced, dense text. Yikes! How could her boss find any highlights there?</p>
<p>How would you decide what to include? Before scrolling down to my suggestions, think about your answer.&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>You can apply these suggestions anytime you need to determine what to include in a report:&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>1. Recognize the report&#39;s purposes. </strong>In the scenario, the director wants highlights to share with an executive. So Victoria should convey high-level experiences and information, not all the details--not the number of conference sessions, the name of the hotel, etc.&#0160;</p>
<p>That&#39;s to meet the reader&#39;s purpose. But the writer&#39;s purpose may be different. Maybe Victoria wants to show the value of the conference to get approval for training in next year&#39;s budget. In that case, she would also focus on the benefits of the conference, her plans to apply what she learned, etc.&#0160;</p>
<p>When you plan a report, write one or two sentences that state its purpose, and use those sentences to help you recognize what to include and what to leave out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Will your director use the report to make a decision about financing a project? Then offer information that will make that decision clearer, things like benefits and costs and how the project supports company goals.&#0160;</li>
<li>Will your peers read the report to incorporate information into a proposal? Include details that will deepen their understanding of the client&#39;s needs.</li>
<li>Will the report go into a file to document a current situation? Provide all the details that will help future readers understand what happened.&#0160;&#0160;</li>
</ul>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>2. Imagine that instead of a report, the individual wanted to ask you a few questions on the topic.</strong> What do you think he or she would ask? If you know the individual, recognizing the likely questions may be easy. In the scenario, Victoria&#39;s director might ask:&#0160;</p>
<ul>
<li>What was the focus of the conference?&#0160;</li>
<li>What were the hottest topics?</li>
<li>Did you attend any sessions led by industry experts? If so, who? On what topics?&#0160;</li>
<li>What did you learn that you could apply in your job or in our company?&#0160;</li>
<li>What did you learn from the expo?&#0160;</li>
<li>Did you see any of our clients or competitors there?&#0160;&#0160;</li>
<li>Overall, how useful was the conference? Would you attend again?&#0160;</li>
</ul>
<p>To write the report, Victoria would answer the questions, keeping in mind that the director wants to share highlights with the VP. Her report sections could be:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[Title] Report on the XXXXX Conference, December 10-13, 2017, San Diego, California</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[Headings]</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Conference Focus<br />Hottest Topics Presented&#0160;<br />Sessions by Industry Experts&#0160;<br />&#0160; &#0160; Joe Smith, Session Title, Key Points<br />&#0160; &#0160; Gloria Gomez, Session Title, Key Points&#0160;<br />&#0160; &#0160; Panel of John Nu, Eva West, Aaron Cho, Title, Key Points<br />Lessons Learned That Apply to Us<br />Expo Highlights<br />Other Attendees<br />Overall Assessment of the Conference<br /><br /></p>
<p>This answering-the-reader&#39;s-questions method can help you recognize what belongs in any report. Here are sample questions for a trip report on a visit to a division of your company, a client&#39;s office, or a customer&#39;s plant:&#0160;</p>
<ul>
<li>What was the purpose of your trip?</li>
<li>Where did you go?</li>
<li>When did you travel?</li>
<li>Who traveled with you?</li>
<li>With whom did you meet there? At what facilities?</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The questions above are the basics, which you can cover briefly. Below are meatier questions.&#0160;</p>
<ul>
<li>What did you accomplish on the trip?</li>
<li>What did you learn?</li>
<li>What do you recommend based on your trip?</li>
<li>Overall, how useful was the trip?</li>
<li>Does anyone need to follow up on the trip? If so, who? How?</li>
</ul>
<p><br />Here are sample questions for an update:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is this report about?</li>
<li>What time period does this report cover?&#0160;Are things on track?</li>
<li>What has been accomplished since the last report?</li>
<li>Have any important events taken place?</li>
<li>Have there been any problems or obstacles? If so, how have they been managed?</li>
<li>Is there anything I need to worry about?</li>
<li>Where can I get more information?</li>
</ul>
<p><br />If you are writing a very important report, such as one to the president of your organization, you may want to have someone else review your list of questions to see whether you are on target before you write the report.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>3. Ask for a sample report if you are unsure what your reader wants. </strong>In the scenario, Victoria might ask her colleagues who are good writers if anyone has an example of a report on a conference.</p>
<p>Especially if you are new in a job or have never written the kind of report requested, ask whether sample reports are available. Review those examples and notice what works for you as a reader. Pay special attention to the kind and amount of information included.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>4. Recognize that your readers have asked for a report--not a book.</strong>&#0160;To restrain yourself from including too much, try these approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leave out any information that does not answer a reader&#39;s question. For instance, if Victoria&#39;s director would not ask whether she had any great meals or how much free swag she received, she should not include those details.</li>
<li>Avoid using chronological order to report. Chronological order will cause you to include irrelevant details just because they happened.</li>
<li>Use headings, preferably descriptive headings such as &quot;Recommendation: Send a Team to the 2018 Conference.&quot; Headings will stop you from including information that does not belong in that section.</li>
<li>Summarize. In the scenario, Victoria should not give details about all the sessions she attended--just a summary and highlights.&#0160;<br />In a report on a client meeting, do not include he said-I said details. Instead, report agreements and outcomes. <br />In a financial or technical report, do not include raw data in the body of the report. If it&#39;s essential, put it in an appendix.&#0160;</li>
<li>Include links to more information and offer to provide more. In Victoria&#39;s report on the conference, she can link to the conference program and offer to provide certain handouts and slides.</li>
<li>Use fewer examples. One or two powerful examples can achieve your goal. Additional examples provide length--not strength.</li>
<li>Use tables and charts rather than sentences to capture numerical information. Graphical illustrations help you leave out extraneous information. Be sure to label each graphic so its relevance is clear to you and your reader.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you succeed with a report, keep it in an electronic folder of model reports. Its success will give you confidence, and its strengths will inspire you the next time someone asks for a report.</p>
