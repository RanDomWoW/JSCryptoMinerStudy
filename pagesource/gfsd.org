  <p>&#8220;Expenditure growth and revenue stagnation&#8221; set the landscape for initial 
  2018-2019 budget development, Assistant Superintendent for Business Bobby 
  Yusko told the Board of Education on Feb 12th, as he outlined a preliminary 
  budget scenario that would create a $2 million gap between revenues and 
  expenditures in 2018-2019. Early scenarios do not include any reductions in 
  program or services, do not account for application of fund balance, and 
  utilize refined state aid estimates based on the Governor's Executive Budget
