<p>The Obama administration ordered the removal of over 500,000Â fugitives with outstanding arrest warrants from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) in late 2016, according to testimony from Acting FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich.</p>
<p>Bowdich confirmed a November report from theÂ <em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/tens-of-thousands-with-outstanding-warrants-purged-from-background-check-database-for-gun-purchases/2017/11/22/b890643c-ced1-11e7-9d3a-bcbe2af58c3a_story.html?utm_term=.cb35213190e9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post</a>Â </em>which set the figure at &#8220;tens of thousands,&#8221; after Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) asked him if more than 500,000 names were dropped from the database.</p>
<blockquote><p>The FBI purged the names from the databaseÂ after the Justice Department changed its legal interpretation of âfugitive from justiceâÂ to say it pertains only to wanted people who have crossed state lines.</p>
<p>What that means is that those fugitives who were previously prohibited under federal law from purchasing firearms can now buy them, unless barred for other reasons. &#8211;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/tens-of-thousands-with-outstanding-warrants-purged-from-background-check-database-for-gun-purchases/2017/11/22/b890643c-ced1-11e7-9d3a-bcbe2af58c3a_story.html?utm_term=.cb35213190e9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>WaPo</em></a></p></blockquote>
<p>âThat was a decision that was made under the previous administration,â Bowdich testified.</p>
<p>âIt was the Department of Justiceâs Office of Legal Counsel that reviewed the law and believed that it needed to be interpreted so that if someone was a fugitive in a state, there had to be indications that they had crossed state lines,â said Bowdich. âOtherwise they were not known to be a fugitive under the law in the way it was interpreted.â</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HCqNuwWgDC8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Since its creation in 1998, the NICS system has prevented 1.5 million people from purchasing a firearm, including 180,000 denials to fugitives from justice, according to government statistics.</p>
<p>While the FBI had a broad definition of &#8220;fugitive,&#8221; meaning anyone with an outstanding arrest warrant, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF)Â definition narrowed the definition to anyone with a warrantÂ <em>who has crossed state lines</em>. The DOJÂ Inspector General, Michael Horowitz, urged the Justice Department to address the disagreement in terms &#8220;as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shortly before President Trump took office, the DOJ Office of Legal Counsel went with the ATF definition.</p>
<blockquote><p>âAny one of these potentially dangerous fugitives can currently walk into a licensed gun dealer, pass a criminal background check, and walk out with a gun,â Robyn Thomas, executive director of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, wrote in a letter to FBI Director Christopher A. Wray on Wednesday. The Giffords organization, founded by former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, called on the FBI and ATF to âcorrect this self-inflicted loopholeâ and recover all guns illegally purchased this year because of the purge of names from the database. &#8211;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/tens-of-thousands-with-outstanding-warrants-purged-from-background-check-database-for-gun-purchases/2017/11/22/b890643c-ced1-11e7-9d3a-bcbe2af58c3a_story.html?utm_term=.cb35213190e9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>WaPo</em></a></p></blockquote>
<p>âThe Justice Department is committed to working with law enforcement partners across the country to help ensure that all those who can legally be determined to be prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm be included in federal criminal databases,â a Justice Department official told the Washington Post last November.</p>

        <div class="entry-content">
        <!-- <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-177564" src="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/opioids-e1521147542445.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="373" /></p>
<p>In 2010, it was found that roughlyÂ <a href="https://www.alternet.org/story/147318/100%252C000_americans_die_each_year_from_prescription_drugs%252C_while_pharma_companies_get_rich" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100,000 Americans die each year</a>Â from prescription drugs alone. When it comes to opioids, the number of deaths is in the tens of thousands while a quarter of patients who were given a short-term prescriptionÂ <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doctors-opioid-addiction_us_55e8e486e4b093be51bb10f2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transitioned to long-term use</a>.</p>
<p>Now, according to a recent Harvard University analysis, doctors who prescribe these pain-killers are being paid huge sums of money from their manufacturers.</p>
<p>The research, which was conducted by Harvard scientists andÂ <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/11/health/prescription-opioid-payments-eprise/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN</a>, discovered that in 2014-2015 thousands of doctors were paid over $25,000 from opioid manufacturers and hundreds more were rewarded with six-figure sums. Also, the more opioids that were prescribed, the larger the reward.</p>
<blockquote><p>âIt smells like doctors are being bribed to sell narcotics, and thatâs very disturbing.â <em>â Dr. Andrew Kolodny, Executive director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The Harvard/CNN analysis found that the 5% doctors who prescribed opioids at a volume which was higher than that of the average physician were paid twice as much money from manufacturers. Likewise, doctors in the top 1% were paid four times as much.</p>
<p>For the top 10th of 1 percent, that number increased nine-fold. To put this in perspective, roughly 54% of doctors who wrote prescriptions to Medicare patients, which numbers more than 200,000, received payment from pharma companies which manufacture opioids.</p>
<blockquote><p>âThe correlation you found in very powerfulâ¦Whatâs amazing about the findings is not simply that money counts, but that more money counts even more.â <em>â David Rothman, director of the Center on Medicine as a Profession at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It is not legal for doctors to prescribe drugs in exchange for compensation from the drug companies, and it is also not provable that most of these doctors were paid in reward for prescribing opioids or if the prescription of opioids attracted the money from pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>However, there is nevertheless a clear financial incentive for doctors to continue to prescribe opioids, even when it isnât in the best interest of the patient.</p>
<blockquote><p>âItâs not proof positive, but itâs another very significant data point in the growing evidence base that marketing payments from drug companies are not good for medicine and more good for patient care.â <em>â Dr. Daniel Carlat, former director of the Prescription Project at the Pew Charitable Trusts</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The effects of opioid addiction can be extremely damaging. One patient who was prescribed a mega powerful opioid (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/opioids/fentanyl.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50-100 times more powerful than morphine</a>) known as Subsys claims that the drug placed her in a âzombie-likeâ state, where she would sometimes wake up on the front lawn or kitchen floor in need of more else she would experience uncontrollable vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
<p>When eventually asked to switch medications away from opioids, her doctor became belligerent, she claims.</p>
<blockquote><p>âHe said it was Subsys or nothingâ¦I trusted my doctor as you trust the police officer thatâs directing traffic when the light is out.â <em>â Angela Contone</em></p></blockquote>
<p>A number of patients have filed lawsuits against their doctors for prescribing opioids for the indented purpose of receiving payments and kickbacks, against the interest of the patient.</p>
<p>Carey Ballou, a patient who was prescribed opioids, recalls her doctor bragging about being flown across the country to lecture other doctors, all paid for by drug companies.</p>
<blockquote><p>âHe said he was going to Miami, and they were going to give him a convertible, and he was going to stay in the best hotel and eat the best Cuban food heâd ever had.â <em>â Carey Ballou</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Carey has since filed a lawsuit against Dr. Steven Simon, who was paid over 1 million dollars by opioid companies according to the federalÂ <a href="https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Payments database</a>.</p>
<p>As more patients become aware of the way doctors prescribe opioids and to their effects, the number of patients who become addicted, or worse, will inevitably drop.</p>
<blockquote><p>âThis is the first time weâve seen this, and itâs really important.â <em>â Dr. Andrew Kolodny</em></p></blockquote>

        <div class="entry-content">
        <!-- <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-177559" src="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/NYPD-drug-dealer-e1521145134440.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="294" /></p>
<p>A New York Police Department officer is now in jail after she was caught running a massive cross-country heroin trafficking ring, all while using her badge as a cover to keep police away from the operations.</p>
<p>The Drug Enforcement Administration began investigating NYPD Officer Yessenia Jimenez, 31, in January after they found the phone number of her boyfriend, Luis Soto, 33, on the cell phone of a narcotics trafficking suspect.</p>
<p>The investigation concluded that Jimenez and Soto were conducting a heroin trafficking operation that stemmed Mexico to New York. The New York Daily NewsÂ <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/nypd-accused-running-drug-den-caught-25g-article-1.3873060" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>Â that the pair was arrested this week after they made a trip to Massachusetts to meet with a heroin trafficker.</p>
<p>DEA, NYPD, and state police task force officers confronted Soto around 2 a.m. on Tuesday after he returned from the trip and was seen unloading bags from the trunk of his car, outside of the coupleâs apartment building in the Soundview neighborhood in Bronx, New York.</p>
<p>Jimenez was sitting in the passenger seat of the car with a purse as her feet that contained $25,000 in cash and the Glock 9-mm gun issued to her from the NYPDâand paid for by taxpayers.</p>
<p>The couple was arrested, and the officers found another $25,000 in cash in a black plastic grocery bag in the car, which Soto claimed he obtained during the trip to Massachusetts. Upon searching the coupleâs apartment, the officers found at least 250 grams of heroin, according to reports.</p>
<p>Jimenez and Soto are now facing drug trafficking and weapons charges, and while Jimenezâs lawyer, Mark Gombiner, did not comment on the drug trafficking, he did criticize the illegal weapons possession charge.</p>
<p><em>âThis is her service weapon,â</em>Â Gombiner said.Â <em>âGiven that sheâs a police officer sheâs kind of mandated [to have] her service weapon with her.â</em></p>
<p>The Associated PressÂ <a href="https://apnews.com/47c071a97499479bb36d56b3a5efd6f6/Officials:-NYPD-officer-took-part-in-heroin-trafficking-ring" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>Â that Jimenez has been suspended without pay from the New York Police Department, and in response to the news of her second job, NYPD Commissioner James OâNeill called the allegations â<em>troubling</em>.â</p>
<p>Jimenez joined the NYPD in 2015, and herÂ <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yessenia.jimenez.54" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook page</a>Â features several photos promoting the saying â<em>Police Lives Matter</em>â with a blue horizontal line across the photo. She also posted photos of herself in NYPD t-shirts, and her intro states, â<em><strong>I PROUDLY SUPPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT</strong></em>Â .â</p>
<p>As The Free Thought Project hasÂ <a href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/widespread-problem-of-police-sex-trafficking-women-exposed-in-las-vegas/">reported</a>, this is not the first time a police officer has been caught using their power to cover up their involvement in drug or sex trafficking. Several officers and a lead prosecutor in Las Vegas were recently charged for working with sex traffickers in exchange for money, drugs, and access to prostitutes.</p>
<p>Las Vegas NowÂ <a href="http://www.lasvegasnow.com/news/i-team-new-evidence-in-alleged-police-corruption-case/970665078" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>Â that the FBI began investigating the allegations in 2014 after they raided the Las Vegas home of music producer and escort service kingpin JamalÂ Rashid, who is known as MallyÂ Mall. A motion filed in court alleged that officers worked with Rashid to target his competitors in the Las Vegas sex industry.</p>
<p>A man was alsoÂ <a href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/video-shows-man-buying-drugs-leaving-in-cop-car/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caught on video</a>Â buying a bag of meth from a group of men and then leaving their house in the same police car that dropped him off. While the cameraman appeared to be one of the residents of the house who provided the drugs, he appeared shocked by the presence of the police car.</p>
<p><em>âHeâs going out into a fâing police car. Is that supposed to be one of our friends?âÂ </em>the man said, later remarking,Â <em>âYes, you really did just see that. Thatâs some fâed up shit.â</em></p>
<p>In the case of former NYPD officer Yessenia Jimenez, she is being held on $75,000 bond, and Luis Soto is being held without bail. It is unclear how long Jimenez has been involved in trafficking drugs, and the full extent of the taxpayer-funded resources she abused during her time with the NYPD has not been made public.</p>

        <div class="entry-content">
        <!-- <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-171686" src="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/flatearth-e1511293159364.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="333" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve spent any time on social media, it&#8217;s very likely you&#8217;ve come across at least one person who believes the Earth is flat. Balking all logic and evidence that points to the fact that the Earth is a globe, including photos from space crafts, one flat earther attempts to explain why no one has fallen off the edge if Earth is flat.</p>
<p>Connor, son of famous flat-earther Dave Murphy,<a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/featured/flat-earther-explains-why-we-dont-fall-off-edge-of-the-earth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> spoke exclusively toÂ <em>UNILAD</em>Â about NASA</a>, the Sun, Photoshop and pretty much everything youâve ever wanted to ask someone who thinks the reason you see the curvature of Earth from a plane is because the windows are round.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/flatearther-finally-explains-why-nobody-has-fallen-off-the-edge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One prominent flat-Earther,</a> Connor Murphy, has revealed why this doesn&#8217;t happen. He&#8217;s concluded that the Earth has no edge at all.Â  Fascinating, right?Â  Well, actually, Murphy thinks we live in some kind of magical gravity less snowglobe.</p>
<p>You can enjoy Murphy&#8217;s entire interview in the video below:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0u8uVx6GMFs" width="560" height="333" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">ï»¿</span></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;Fall off into what, do you know what Iâm saying? Thereâs no edge. This is a misconception,&#8221; MurphyÂ <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/featured/flat-earther-explains-why-we-dont-fall-off-edge-of-the-earth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told <em>Unilad</em></a>. &#8220;The way we see it is itâs an enclosed system. Thereâs water above, thereâs the firmament â or the dome â and thereâs water above it and water below it and thereâs no leaving it, thereâs no anti-gravity allowing us to float around and find other Suns and stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the interview, Murphy went on to accuse NASA of covering up that the Earth was flat in order to make more money, before contradicting his earlier view that weÂ don&#8217;t fall off because we&#8217;re in a dome. &#8220;Basically if you can imagine the globe squashed down with Antarctica instead of being its own continent, being the perimeter around the side. So a lot of people say thatâs an ice wall. Itâs more like a shelf or cliff.&#8221;</p>
<p>But no one, ever, no flat-earther or otherwise has ever discovered this dome. No one has discovered the ice wall either. So what&#8217;s beyond the dome?Â  It really makes little sense.</p>
<p>And while it is true that the government has lied to us about almost everything, and one should always conduct their own research into everything,<a href="https://www.space.com/38931-kids-can-prove-earth-round.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> experiments can be done at home to at least show evidence that the Earth is a globe</a>.</p>

        <div class="entry-content">
        <!-- <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-177552" src="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Monsanto-e1521142363158.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="373" /></p>
<p>A group that dedicates itself to conjoining people with the pressing policy issues that affect them is being targeted byÂ <a href="https://www.naturalnews.com/053343_Monsanto_evil_corporation_Agent_Orange.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the worldâs most evil corporation</a>Â for daring to spread the truth about the toxicity of glyphosate, a highly pervasive crop chemical thatâs commonly sprayed on genetically-modified (GM) crops.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/monsanto-avaaz-glyphosate-2538134798.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to reports</a>, Monsanto has served the civic campaigning group Avaaz with a 168-page subpoena that demands all of its internal correspondences concerning glyphosate â more than a decadeâs worth â be turned over to the New York Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The subpoena, which âcommandsâ Avaaz to do this, is part of a witch hunt by Monsanto to silence its opposition using expensive litigation and scare tactics. In this case, Monsanto wants Avaaz to stop campaigning against glyphosate, includingÂ its 2017 effort to block the European Union from re-issuing a 15-year license for the use of glyphosate in Europe.</p>
<p>Other Avaaz campaigns against glyphosate include another effort that same year to stop the building of a Monsanto-owned GM seed factory in Argentina, as well as an ongoing campaign to stop Monsanto from achieving its goal of establishing a so-called âmega-mergerâ with fellow GMO and chemical giant Bayer.</p>
<p>Avaaz founder Ricken Patel admits that the request is massive, considering that Avaaz staffers have spent a considerable amount of time and resources working towards a ban onÂ <a href="http://glyphosate.news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">glyphosate</a>. On the groupâs website, Patel noted that the subpoena demands includeÂ âpretty much every single private email, document, note, chat or anything else that any Avaaz staffer has ever written or done on our campaigns to ban Monsantoâs key herbicide, glyphosate.â</p>
<p><strong>Is Monsanto planning to conduct âhitsâ on members of the public as punishment for spreading theÂ truth?</strong></p>
<p>Whatâs perhaps more disturbing is the scope of the details that Monsanto is requesting. Per the sweeping language contained in the subpoena, Monsanto is essentially demanding that Avaaz procure the private details of its employees, including contact information and other personal details.</p>
<p>Why Monsanto wants all of this has yet to be determined. But recognizing the aggressive ways in which the mega-corporation has bullied farmers, non-profit groups, and many others in the past, thereâs no telling what it might have in store for Avaaz.</p>
<p>Even members of the public could be at risk, as internal company documents also include the names and email addresses of people who have signed Avaaz petitions calling for a ban on Monsanto products. One such petition seeking a moratorium on the use of glyphosate reportedly garnered more than two millions signatures â and Monsanto is basically demanding to have access to the identities of these signers.</p>
<p>The subpoena from Monsanto comes in response to a sweeping class-action lawsuit against the company in which plaintiffs from all across the country are suing on behalf of themselves or their loved ones, whom they claim developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma as a result of exposure to Roundup, the brand-named Monsanto herbicide that contains glyphosate.</p>
<p>Monsanto is apparently retaliating against those who helped fuel this class-action lawsuit, of which Avaaz is named among the culprits.</p>
<p>âThis is big,â Avaaz states in one of its latest petitions. â[Monsantoâs] a $50 billion mega-corporation, infamous for legal strong-arm tactics like this. They have unlimited resources. If they get their hands on all our private information, thereâs no telling what theyâll use it for.â</p>
<p>Avaazâs Deputy Director, Emma Ruby-Sachs, says that not only is the demand heinous in intent, but it also violates the First Amendment rights of the group and its employees.</p>
<p>âThere are millions of people around the world who have a deep and genuine concern that Monsantoâs glyphosate is making us and our environment sick,â she says. âThat is the sole reason our members have called on governments to regulate it based on independent science. Weâre not going to let this legal attack slow down that essential work one bit.â</p>

<p>Alexandria, Va â This Tuesday morning, a teacher who also serves as a reserve police officer accidentally fired his gun at a school in Seaside, California, while instructing a class on firearms safety.</p>
<p>Three students were injured, and one was hospitalized, but the school did not report the incident, nor did they notify the parents or seek medical help for the injured children. The most badly injured of the three went home to his father covered in blood with a serious wound, and bullet fragments lodged into his neck.</p>
<p>According to Seaside Police Chief Abdul Pridgen, officer Dennis Alexander was pointing the gun at the ceiling when he accidentally fired, sending bullet fragments to ricochet across the classroom. The school resumed classes as normal and later told reporters that the students had minor injuries, but one father disagrees.</p>
<p>Fermin Gonzales, the father of the 17-year-old boy who was hospitalized, said that the school never notified parents about the incident.</p>
<p><em>âHeâs shaken up, but heâs going to be OK. Iâm just pretty upset that no one told us anything and we had to call the police ourselves to report it,â</em>Â Gonzales toldÂ <a href="http://www.ksbw.com/article/seaside-high-teacher-accidentally-fires-gun-in-class/19426017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KSBW</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>âItâs the craziest thing. It could have been very bad,â</strong>Â </em>Gonzales added.</p>
<p>According to Seaside Superintendent PK Diffenbaugh, this was not an authorized course.</p>
<p><em>âI think a lot of questions on parentsâ minds are, why a teacher would be pointing a loaded firearm at the ceiling in front of students. Clearly in this incident protocols were not followed,â</em>Â Diffenbaugh said.</p>
<p>Seaside High School is a gun free zone, but exceptions are made for members of law enforcement.</p>
<p>The mainstream media is complicit in the attempted coverup of this issue, with many outlets overlooking the fact that this teacher was a police officer. Instead, they are using this as an opportunity to point out that guns are dangerous.</p>
<p>It is obvious that guns are dangerous, and that is why they should be handled with care, but cases like this illustrate that police officers are no more safe with guns than the average person. Therefore, it makes no sense to suggest that police should be the only ones allowed with guns.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/InXzzmCAhf4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the same day, on the other side of the country, in Alexandria, Virginia, another school resource officer accidentally fired his gun while inside his office at George Washington Middle School. According to the Alexandria Police Department, the officer was sitting down while it was discharged, and that no one was hurt. They would not say whether or not the gun was in the holster, but if the gun was fired, it is safe to assume that it was not in the holster.</p>
<p>Contrary to how the rest of the media is reporting these incidents guns do not simply âgo offâ by themselves. With modern handguns,Â <a href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/cop-accidentally-shoots-pistol-airport-practicing-quick-draw-skills/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this is not possible.</a></p>
<p><em>âI just think it was an accident that happened, and weâre going to investigate it and find out, and weâre going to move forward,â</em>Â <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcwashington.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2FSchool-Resource-Officer-Accidentally-Fires-Weapon-Inside-School-476676103.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capt. D.C. Hayes told NBC.</a></p>
<p>Imagine if another adult or child who is not a cop did the same thing. The school would be on lock down, helicopters would be swarming the air and the person who fired the shotââaccidentallyâ or notâwould be taken out with extreme prejudice. Instead, this is just written off with very little media coverage because the âgunmanâ was a public servant.</p>
<p>The Captain would not say if there were any students nearby, only that no students were injured and that classes continued as normal after it was determined that everyone was safe.</p>
<p>It is important to reiterate that in both of these cases the issue was swept under the rug because the guns were fired by police. In every other case where there is even a possible sighting of a gun, schools are locked down, parents are called, and classes are canceled.</p>
<p>It is also important to point out the convenient timing of guns being accidentally fired in schools as America debates putting guns in schools. Since the debate began, there have been several instances of guns being fired âaccidentallyâ in schools across America.</p>

<p>Russian president Vladimir Putin said that as a part of Russia&#8217;s reinvigorated space program, the country will send people to both the moon and Mars. Russia is expected to begin their revamped journey in space next year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/russia-moon-mars-vladimir-putin-latest-roscosmos-space-exploration-nasa-spacex-elon-musk-a8257441.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to <em>The Independent</em>,</a> the Russian government will begin by sending landers to the red planet, yet the country hopes to send people there soon after that, said the Putin. Russia&#8217;s space agency will also attempt to put people at the poles of the Moon, he said.Â  The purpose of Russia&#8217;s moon landing would be an exploration of the moon&#8217;s poles.Â  Putin described that as a continuation of the work done during the Soviet space program.</p>
<p>That work reached its peak in the midst of the Cold War, as the US and Russia battled it out to get the first person into space and then onto the moon. Russia won the race to send the first person into space but has never put one of its cosmonauts on the moon.</p>
<p>Putin didn&#8217;t specifically say that Russia was racing<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-at-sxsw-says-spacex-could-begin-testing-mars-rocket-in-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Elon Musk and his Space X program to Mars or the moon, but Musk did announce</a> that he intends to launch his rocket to the Red Planet in 2019.</p>
<p>Putin also said that landing on the moon could be a vital step in future space endeavors.Â  The moon could be used as a launching point for other missions to other plants.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/russia-will-beat-nasa-mars-and-find-water-moon-says-putin-845988" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Putin also said Russia will beat NASA to Mars</a> and will be the nation that discovers water on the moon.Â Â &#8220;We are planning unmanned and later manned launches, into deep space, as part of a lunar program and for Mars exploration.Â The closest mission is very soon, we are planning to launch a mission to Mars in 2019,&#8221; Putin said.</p>
<p>So far, Russiaâs attempts at a Mars mission have ended much like their mission to the moon: in failure. In 2011, the ill-fated Phobos-Grunt probe was unable to be fired toward the orbit of the red planet after launch.Â Its mission was designed to bring back samples from the planet&#8217;s moon Phobos.</p>

        <!-- <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-177526" src="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/trafficking-e1521137652771.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="315" /></p>
<p>Trafficked children are forced to peddle candy and other goods on the streets of US cities, anti-slavery campaigners have reported. The Polaris charity said it saw a 13 percent increase in reported abuses last year.</p>
<p>The Washington-based charity is increasingly hearing of childrenÂ <em>âselling candy or other goods out of baskets out on the street&#8230;in major cities,â</em>Â including New York and Washington, Bradley Myles, the executive director and CEO of Polaris, said on Wednesday.</p>
<p><em>âWe still only have a small handful of cases, but itâs an emerging form of labor trafficking,â</em>Â he told Thomson Reuters.</p>
<p>PolarisÂ <a href="http://polarisproject.org/2017statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">received</a>Â 8,759 calls and texts to its national human trafficking hotline in 2017. The great majority of the calls, around 6,250, were about concerns that someone was being sold for sex against their will. Another 1,250 were about suspected forced labor, including previously unrecorded forms of exploitation.</p>
<p>The organization said the abuse of trafficked people for peddling and begging the the third-most common form of forced labor it had heard of last year, after domestic servitude and agricultural labor, with 109 cases reported. Almost two-thirds of victims who contacted the charity directly after being trafficked for sex or work said their abuse began when they were minors.</p>
<p>More victims of people-trafficking were encouraged by their families to seek help from the 24-hour Polaris hotline, Myles said. But he warned that efforts by modern-day slave masters to prevent that by stopping victims from contacting their relativesÂ <em>âis a massive issue already.â</em></p>
<p>Methods used to coerce victims into staying includeÂ <em>âisolation (including confinement), emotional abuse, economic abuse, threats of any kind, and physical abuse,â</em>Â the report said.</p>
<p>A Senate report published last year said there were some 1.5 million trafficked people in the US, most of them were children and most were sexually exploited. That figure is close to four percent of the more than 40 million victims worldwide, according to an estimate from the International Labor Organization (ILO).</p>

        <div class="entry-content">
        <!-- <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-158979" src="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/hawking.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="333" srcset="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/hawking.jpg 559w, http://www.thedailysheeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/hawking-300x178.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></p>
<p>World-renowned theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking passed away Tuesday, leaving behind aÂ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/14/stephen-hawking-professor-dies-aged-76" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legacy</a>Â of innovation when it comes to understanding black holes, time and space, and the universe in general.</p>
<p>In recent years, Hawking, who suffered from Lou Gehrigâs disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, was outspoken on a variety of issues, often addressing societal, environmental, and existential dilemmas plaguing humanity.</p>
<p>In 2016, he speculated that alien life exists but warned humanity to be cautious about pursuing relations with it, comparing extraterrestrialsâ intentions to some of the worst exploitations humanity has inflicted on itself.</p>
<p>On multiple occasions, heÂ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/23/stephen-hawking-warns-against-seeking-out-aliens-in-new-film" target="_blank" rel="noopener">echoed</a>Â the sentiment that when the Native Americans first encountered Christopher Columbus, it â<i>didnât turn out so well.â</i></p>
<p>â<i>If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didnât turn out well for the Native Americans,â</i>Â heÂ <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2010/04/aliens_stephen_hawking.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>Â as far back as 2010, adding thatÂ <i>âaliens might simply raid Earth for resources, then move on.â</i></p>
<p>Hawking was also deeply skeptical of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p><i>âSuccess in creating effective AI, could be the biggest event in the history of our civilization. Or the worst. We just donât know. So we cannot know if we will be infinitely helped by AI, or ignored by it and side-lined, or conceivably destroyed by it,â</i>Â heÂ <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/06/stephen-hawking-ai-could-be-worst-event-in-civilization.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>Â last year.</p>
<blockquote><p>âUnless we learn how to prepare for, and avoid, the potential risks, AI could be the worst event in the history of our civilization. It brings dangers, like powerful autonomous weapons, or new ways for the few to oppress the many. It could bring great disruption to our economy.â</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2015, heÂ <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/stephen-hawking-world-government-stop-technology-destroy-humankind-th-a7618021.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asserted</a>Â thatÂ <i>âThe real risk with AI isnât malice but competence. A super intelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals arenât aligned with ours, weâre in trouble.â</i></p>
<p>Hawkingâs fear of technology in general led him to advocate a controversial solution. He suggestedÂ âsome form of world governmentâ might be needed to save humanity but also acknowledged âthat might become a tyranny.â</p>
<p>He was more firm on other proposed solutions, particularly that humans need to leave Earth and colonize Mars and the moon or face extinction, in part due to theÂ <a href="https://qz.com/1020528/stephen-hawking-donald-trumps-climate-change-policies-spell-disaster-for-the-planet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">destruction of the environment</a>Â and the likelihood that an asteroid will eventually hit the planet.</p>
<p><i>âThis is not science fiction it is guaranteed by the laws of physics and probability,â</i>Â he said last year regarding an impending asteroid. â<i>To stay risks being annihilated</i>.â</p>
<p>He also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>âI am convinced that humans need to leave earth. The Earth is becoming too small for us, our physical resources are being drained at an alarming rate.</p>
<p>âWe have given our planet the disastrous gift of climate change, rising temperatures, the reducing of polar ice caps, deforestation and decimation of animal species.â</p></blockquote>
<p>He concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>âThe human race has existed a separate species for about two million years. Civilization became about 10,000 years ago and the rate of development has been steadily increasing, If humanity is to continue for another million years it relies on boldly going where no one has gone before. I hope for the best. I have to. We have no other option.â</p></blockquote>
<p>Hawking alsoÂ <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/12107623/Prof-Stephen-Hawking-disaster-on-planet-Earth-is-a-near-certainty.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned</a>Â of the risks of nuclear war and genetically engineered viruses.</p>
<p>Despite Hawkingâs stark warnings, he insisted remained positive. As he said after warning of the risks of A.I.:</p>
<blockquote><p>âAll this may sound a bit doom-laden but I am an optimist. I think the human race will rise to meet these challenges.â</p></blockquote>
<p>Hawking was 76 and lived decadesÂ <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/14/health/stephen-hawking-dead/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">longer</a>Â than he was expected to after he was diagnosed with Lou Gehrigâs disease.</p>

<p>A young woman claimed Friday she was fired from her Virginia job for possessing a concealed-carry permit, but the city is saying otherwise.</p>
<p>Storm Durham, who identified herself as a 22-year-old sexual assault survivor in now-deleted Facebook posts,Â <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2018/03/10/virginia-woman-fired-concealed-carry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asserted</a>Â Friday she was fired fromÂ Roanoke City Social Services for âhaving a concealed-carry permit.â Three Roanoke police officers escorted Durham from the premises because she was deemed a âsafety threat to the building,â she revealed.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was fired today. From Roanoke City Social Services, serving as a damn good social worker. I was fired for having a concealed carry permit. Not the gun, the permit. I was escorted by 3 city police officers bc I am a &quot;safety risk to the building&quot;</p>
<p>&mdash; Storm Durham (@chelstorrm) <a href="https://twitter.com/chelstorrm/status/972265414460928002?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 10, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>âA former employee of the city of Roanoke recently posted via social media assertions regarding the basis of her dismissal from city employment,â the City of Roanoke Office for Communications said in a statement. âThe city does not publicly comment on specific personnel matters. In light of these assertions, however, it is important to note that the city of Roanoke respects the Constitutional rights of its citizens and that the dismissal in question was not based upon anyoneâs exercise of such rights.â</p>
<p>âThe city of Roanoke has no policy or procedure that limits the right of employees to hold concealed-carry permits as authorized by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia,â a city official told The Daily Caller News Foundation.</p>
<p>Durham was fired from her job forÂ performance problems, unprofessional behavior, missed work, dress code violations, and workplace safety concerns, according to theÂ <a href="https://twitter.com/MisUnderStd_2/status/973725206828257280" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notice</a>Â of dismissalÂ <a href="https://www.wsls.com/news/virginia/roanoke/former-roanoke-social-services-employee-claims-she-was-fired-for-having-concealed-carry-permit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WSLS obtained</a>.</p>
<p>Durhamâs employers pointed to her possession of a concealed-carry permit when she asked about the âworkplace safety concern,â she explained to WSLS Wednesday. Her supervisor previously broached the issue with her during a meeting in February, which was documented in the dismissal notice, Durham said in videos now deleted from Facebook.</p>
<p>The other reasons for her dismissal are unsubstantiated, DurhamÂ <a href="http://www.roanoke.com/news/local/roanoke/former-social-services-employee-whose-claims-went-viral-intends-to/article_013f0e88-f120-5e5a-831a-8f35447b579f.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued</a>. The City of Roanoke would not provide clarification on âworkplace safety concerns.â</p>
<p>Concerning the part of the narrative that police escorted her from the building, SnopesÂ <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/was-a-dss-worker-fired-in-roanoke-city-over-a-gun-permit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obtained</a>Â the relevant police indicating Durhamâs employers âwanted [the police] there because they didnât know how Ms. Durham was going to react to the situation [presumably her dismissal].â</p>
<p>Durham has a large fan base, while she also received significant criticism for her story. She posted the following in response on Twitter Wednesday.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Continue to speak negative, insult my looks and voice, and not support my story. That is totally fine, you have an opinion as well and I support that. I will continue to remain positive and it will lead me to become a better person âºï¸</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Durham did not respond to The Daily Caller News Foundationâs requests for clarification.</p>

<blockquote><p>âEvery day in communities across the United States, children and adolescents spend the majority of their waking hours in schools that have increasingly come to resemble places of detention more than places of learning. From metal detectors to drug tests, from increased policing to all-seeing electronic surveillance,Â <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/184467407X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the public schools of the twenty-first century reflect a society that has become fixated on crime, security and violence</a>.ââInvestigative journalist Annette Fuentes</p></blockquote>
<p>Just what we donât need:Â <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doj-school-resource-officers-school-schootings_us_5aa707e3e4b03c9edfaee4eb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more gun-toting, taser-wielding cops</a>Â in government-run schools that bear an uncomfortable resemblance to prisons.</p>
<p>Microcosms of the police state, Americaâs public schools already contain almost every aspect of the militarized, intolerant, senseless, overcriminalized, legalistic, surveillance-riddled, totalitarian landscape that plagues those of us on the âoutside.â</p>
<p>Now the Trump Administration wants to double down on these totalitarian echo chambers.</p>
<p>The Justice Department, headed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, has announced that it willÂ <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doj-school-resource-officers-school-schootings_us_5aa707e3e4b03c9edfaee4eb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provide funding for schools that want to hire more resource officers</a>. The White House has also hinted that it may repeal âRethink School Disciplineâ policies,Â <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/12/devos-commission-eyes-obama-school-discipline-rules/418147002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heralding a return to zero tolerance policies</a>Â that treat children like suspects and criminals, especially within the public schools.</p>
<p>As for President Trump, he wants toÂ <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/01/school-shootings-security-guns-431424" target="_blank" rel="noopener">âhardenâ the schools</a>.</p>
<p>What exactly does hardening the schools entail?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/12/devos-commission-eyes-obama-school-discipline-rules/418147002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More strident zero tolerance policies</a>,Â <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doj-school-resource-officers-school-schootings_us_5aa707e3e4b03c9edfaee4eb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greater numbers of school cops</a>, and all theÂ <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/02/the-nras-plan-to-harden-schools-is-terrifying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trappings of a prison complex</a>Â (unsurmountable fences, entrapment areas, no windows or trees, etc.).</p>
<p>Just when you thought this administration couldnât get any more tone-deaf about civil liberties, they prove once again that they have absolutely no regard for the Constitution (especially the Fourth Amendment), no concept of limited government, and no concern for the growing need to protect âwe the peopleâ against an overreaching, overbearing police state.</p>
<p>Americaâs schools today are already about as authoritarian as they come.</p>
<p>From the moment a child entersÂ <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=84" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the nationâs 98,000 public schools</a>Â to the moment he or she graduates, they will be exposed to a steady diet of:</p>
<ul>
<li>draconian zero tolerance policies that criminalize childish behavior,</li>
<li>overreaching anti-bullying statutes that criminalize speech,</li>
<li>school resource officers (police) tasked with disciplining and/or arresting so-called âdisorderlyâ students,</li>
<li>standardized testing that emphasizes rote answers over critical thinking,</li>
<li>politically correct mindsets that teach young people to censor themselves and those around them,</li>
<li>and extensive biometric and surveillance systems that, coupled with the rest, acclimate young people to a world in which they have no freedom of thought, speech or movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Young people in America are now first in line to be searched, surveilled, spied on, threatened, tied up, locked down, treated like criminals for non-criminal behavior, tasered and in some cases shot.</p>
<p>Roped into the governmentâs profit-driven campaign to keep the nation âsafeâ from drugs, weapons and terrorism, many schools have transformed themselves into quasi-prisons, complete with surveillance cameras, metal detectors, police patrols, zero tolerance policies, lock downs, drug sniffing dogs, strip searches and active shooter drills.</p>
<p>It used to be that if you talked back to a teacher, or played a prank on a classmate, or just failed to do your homework, you might find yourself in detention or doing an extra writing assignment after school.</p>
<p>That is no longer the case.</p>
<p>Nowadays, students are not only punished for minor transgressions such as playing cops and robbers on the playground, bringing LEGOs to school, or having a food fight, but the punishments have become far more severe, shifting from detention and visits to the principalâs office into misdemeanor tickets, juvenile court, handcuffs, tasers and even prison terms.</p>
<p>Students have been suspended under school zero tolerance policies for bringing to school âlook alike substancesâ such asÂ <a href="http://www.abc2news.com/homepage-showcase/middle-school-students-busted-for-bringing-fake-drugs-to-school" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oregano</a>,Â <a href="https://reason.com/archives/1998/01/01/brickbats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breath mints</a>, birth controlÂ <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/04/AR2009040402591.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pills</a>Â andÂ <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/1576762/posts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">powdered sugar</a>.</p>
<p>Look-alike weapons (toy gunsâeven Lego-sized ones, hand-drawn pictures of guns,Â <a href="https://reason.com/blog/2014/12/29/the-top-10-zero-tolerance-follies-of-201#.vgodno:K7nn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pencils twirled</a>Â in a âthreateningâ manner, imaginary bows and arrows, even fingers positioned like guns) can also land a student in hot water.</p>
<p>Even good deeds do not go unpunished.</p>
<p>One 13-year-old was given detention for exposing the school to âliabilityâ byÂ <a href="https://reason.com/blog/2014/12/29/the-top-10-zero-tolerance-follies-of-201#.vgodno:K7nn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharing his lunch</a>Â with a hungry friend. A third grader wasÂ <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/colorado-girl-shaves-head-for-pal-with-cancer-temporarily-suspended/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suspended for shaving her head</a>Â in sympathy for a friend who had lost her hair to chemotherapy. And then there was the high school senior who wasÂ <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/08/20/student-punished-for-saying-bless.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suspended for saying âbless youâ</a>Â after a fellow classmate sneezed.</p>
<p>In South Carolina, where itâs against the law to disturb a school, more than a thousand students a yearâsome as young as 7 years oldââ<a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/south-carolina-student-was-arrested-disturbing-school-when-she-challenged-police" target="_blank" rel="noopener">face criminal charges for not following directions, loitering, cursing, or the vague allegation of acting âobnoxiously</a>.â If charged as adults, they can be held in jail for up to 90 days.â</p>
<p>These outrageous incidents are exactly what youâll see more of if the Trump Administration gets its way.</p>
<p>Increasing the number of cops in the schools only adds to the problem.</p>
<p>Indeed, theÂ <a href="http://time.com/4093517/south-carolina-school-police-ben-fields/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing presence of police in the nationâs schools</a>Â is resulting inÂ <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/03/police-kids-schools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greater police âinvolvement in routine discipline matters</a>Â that principals and parents used to address without involvement from law enforcement officers.â</p>
<p>Funded by the U.S. Department of Justice, these school resource officers (SRO) have become de facto wardens in elementary, middle and high schools, doling out their own brand of justice to the so-called âcriminalsâ in their midst with the help ofÂ <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/05/police-school-resource-officers-k-12-misconduct-violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tasers, pepper spray, batons and brute force</a>.</p>
<p>The horror stories are legion.</p>
<p>One SRO is accused of punching a 13-year-old student in the faceÂ <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/05/police-school-resource-officers-k-12-misconduct-violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for cutting the cafeteria line</a>.</p>
<p>ThatÂ <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/05/police-school-resource-officers-k-12-misconduct-violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">same cop put another student in a chokehold</a>Â a week later, allegedly knocking the student unconscious and causing a brain injury.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, a student was tased afterÂ <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2009/09/recipe-disaster-school-cops-are-being-armed-50000-volt-tasers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ignoring an order to put his cell phone away</a>.</p>
<p>When 13-year-old Kevens Jean Baptiste failed to follow a school bus driverâs direction to keep the bus windows closed (Kevens, who suffers from asthma, opened the window after a fellow student sprayed perfume, causing him to cough and wheeze), he wasÂ <a href="http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Family-Plans-To-File-Complaint-Over-Boynton-Beach-Police-Video-259166561.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handcuffed by police, removed from the bus, and while still handcuffed, had his legs swept out from under him</a>Â by an officer, causing him to crash to the ground.</p>
<p>Young Alex Stone didnât even make it past the first week of school before he became a victim of the police state. Directed by his teacher to do aÂ <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/20/teen-says-he-was-suspended-and-detained-for-joking-about-killing-a-pet-dinosaur/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creative writing assignment involving a series of fictional Facebook statuses</a>, Stone wrote, âI killed my neighbor&#8217;s pet dinosaur. I bought the gun to take care of the business.â Despite the fact that dinosaurs are extinct, the status fabricated, and the South Carolina student was merely following orders, his teacher reported him to school administrators, who in turn called the police.</p>
<p>What followed is par for the course in schools today: students were locked down in their classrooms whileÂ <a href="http://www.live5news.com/story/26319685/cops-summerville-high-school-student-arrested-after-writing-threatening-message-on-assignment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">armed police searched the 16-year-oldâs locker and bookbag, handcuffed him, charged him with disorderly conduct</a>Â disturbing the school, arrested him, detained him, and then he was suspended from school.</p>
<p>Not even the younger, elementary school-aged kids are being spared these âhardeningâ tactics.</p>
<p>On any given day when school is in session,Â <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/schools-restraints-seclusions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kids who âact upâ in class are pinned facedown on the floor, locked in dark closets, tied up with straps, bungee cords and duct tape, handcuffed, leg shackled, tasered or otherwise restrained, immobilized or placed in solitary confinement</a>Â in order to bring them under âcontrol.â</p>
<p>In almost every case, these undeniably harsh methods are used to punish kidsâsome as young as 4 and 5 years oldâfor simply failing to follow directions or throwing tantrums. Very rarely do the kids pose any credible danger to themselves or others. Unbelievably,Â <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/schools-restraints-seclusions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these tactics are all legal</a>, at least when employed by school officials or school resource officers in the nationâs public schools.</p>
<p>This is what happens when you introduce police and police tactics into the schools.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, by the time you add in the lockdowns and active shooter drills, instead of making the schools safer, school officials have succeeded in creating an environment in whichÂ <a href="file:///dc01/ttp/::www.help.senate.gov:imo:media:doc:Seclusion%20and%20Restraints%20Final%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">children are so traumatized</a>Â that they suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, nightmares, anxiety, mistrust of adults in authority, as well as feelings of anger, depression, humiliation, despair and delusion.</p>
<p>For example, a middle school in Washington State went onÂ <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/17/us/in-age-of-school-shootings-lockdown-drills-are-the-new-duck-and-cover.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lockdown after a student brought a toy gun to class</a>. A Boston high school went intoÂ <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/17/us/in-age-of-school-shootings-lockdown-drills-are-the-new-duck-and-cover.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lockdown for four hours after a bullet was discovered in a classroom</a>. A North Carolina elementary school locked down and called in police after aÂ <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/17/us/in-age-of-school-shootings-lockdown-drills-are-the-new-duck-and-cover.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fifth grader reported seeing an unfamiliar man in the school</a>Â (it turned out to be a parent).</p>
<p>Police officers at a Florida middle school carried out an active shooter drill in an effort to educate students about how to respond in the event of an actual shooting crisis. Two armedÂ <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp/2014/11/14/i-thought-he-was-going-to-shoot-me-unsuspecting-middle-school-students-terrified-by-active-shooter-drill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officers, guns loaded and drawn, burst into classrooms, terrorizing the students</a>Â and placing the school into lockdown mode.</p>
<p>If these exercises are intended to instill fear and compliance into young people, theyâre working.</p>
<p>As journalist Dahlia Lithwick points out: âI donât recall any serious national public dialogue about lockdown protocols or how they became the norm. It seems simply to have begun,Â <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2013/12/lockdown_drills_what_are_school_shooting_trainings_teaching_kids.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modeling itself on the lockdowns that occur during prison riots</a>, and then spread until school lockdowns and lockdown drills are as common for our children as fire drills, and as routine as duck-and-cover drills were in the 1950s.â</p>
<p>The toll such incidents take on adults can be life-altering, but when such police brutality is perpetrated on young people, the end result is nothing less than complete indoctrination into becoming compliant citizens of a totalitarian state.</p>
<p>Schools acting like prisons.</p>
<p>School officials acting like wardens.</p>
<p>Students treated like inmates and punished like hardened criminals.</p>
<p>This is the end product of all those so-called school âsafetyâ policies, which run the gamut from zero tolerance policies that punish all infractions harshly to surveillance cameras, metal detectors, random searches, drug-sniffing dogs, school-wide lockdowns, active-shooter drills and militarized police officers.</p>
<p>There can be no avoiding the hands-on lessons being taught in the schools about the role of police in our lives, ranging from active shooter drills and school-wide lockdowns to incidents in which children engaging in typically childlike behavior are suspended (<a href="https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/on_the_front_lines/rutherford_institute_defends_10_year_old_suspended_for_shooting_imaginary_a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for shooting an imaginary âarrowâ</a>Â at a fellow classmate), handcuffed (<a href="http://www.today.com/news/video-emerges-boy-8-handcuffed-school-officer-facing-lawsuit-t36461" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for being disruptive at school</a>), arrested (<a href="http://www.wbtw.com/story/22286425/nc-high-school-students-charged-in-water-balloon-prank-near-graduation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for throwing water balloons</a>Â as part of a school prank), and even tasered (<a href="http://wtvr.com/2015/04/16/elko-midle-student-taser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for not obeying instructions</a>).</p>
<p>Instead of raising up a generation of freedom fightersâwhich one would hope would be the objective of the schoolsâgovernment officials seem determined to churn out newly minted citizens of the American police state who are being taught the hard way what it means to comply, fear and march in lockstep with the governmentâs dictates.</p>
<p>So whatâs the answer, not only for the here-and-nowâthe children growing up in these quasi-prisonsâbut for the future of this country?</p>
<p>How do you convince a child who has been routinely handcuffed, shackled, tied down, locked up, and immobilized by government officialsâall before he reaches the age of adulthoodâthat he has any rights at all, let alone the right to challenge wrongdoing, resist oppression and defend himself against injustice?</p>
<p>Most of all, how do you persuade a fellow American that the government works for him when for most of his young life, he has been incarcerated in an institution that teaches young people to be obedient and compliant citizens who donât talk back, donât question and donât challenge authority?</p>
<p>Peter Gray, a professor of psychology at Boston College, believes thatÂ <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/08/26/school_is_a_prison_and_damaging_our_kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">school is a prison that is damaging our kids</a>, and itâs hard to disagree, especially with the numbers ofÂ <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/03/police-kids-schools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">police officers being assigned to schools on the rise</a>.</p>
<p>Students, in turn, are not only finding themselves subjected to police tactics such as handcuffs, leg shackles, tasers and excessive force for âacting upâ but are also beingÂ <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/03/police-kids-schools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ticketed, fined and sent to court for behavior perceived as defiant, disruptive or disorderly</a>Â such as spraying perfume and writing on a desk.</p>
<p>Clearly, the pathology that characterizes the American police state has passed down to the schools.</p>
<p>Now in addition to the government and its agents viewing the citizenry as suspects to be probed, poked, pinched, tasered, searched, seized, stripped and generally manhandled, all with the general blessing of the courts, our children in the public schools are also fair game forÂ <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/local/crime/article_f23b192a-648d-525d-ab99-87693b89fe11.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">school resource officers who taser teenagers</a>Â andÂ <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/12/08/handcuffed-child/20106187/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handcuff kindergartners</a>, school officials who haveÂ <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2015/02/08/childhood-criminalized-suspended-in-elementary-school/">criminalized childhood behavior</a>, school lockdowns andÂ <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2013/12/lockdown_drills_what_are_school_shooting_trainings_teaching_kids.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">terror drills</a>Â that teach your children to fear and comply, and a police state mindset that has transformed the schools intoÂ <a href="http://georgetownlawjournal.org/files/2014/04/CurtisTracing.pdf">quasi-prisons</a>.</p>
<p>Donât even get me started on the âschool-to-prison pipeline,â the phenomenon in which children who are suspended or expelled from school have a greater likelihood of ending up in jail. One study found that âbeing suspended or expelled made a student nearlyÂ <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/01/30/are-school-resource-officers-part-of-the-school-to-prison-pipeline-problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three times more likely</a>Â to come into contact with the juvenile justice system within the next year.â</p>
<p>By the time the average young person in America finishes their public school education, nearlyÂ <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2011-12-19/youth-arrests-increase/52055700/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one out of every three of them will have been arrested</a>. Nearly 40 percent of those young people who are arrested will serve time in a private prison, where theÂ <a href="http://projects.huffingtonpost.com/prisoners-of-profit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emphasis is on making profits for large megacorporations</a>Â above all else.</p>
<p>Indeed, this profit-driven system of incarceration has also given rise to a growth in juvenile prisons and financial incentives for jailing young people. In this way, young people have becomeÂ <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pennsylvania-seeks-close-books-kids-cash-scandal-n408666" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easy targets for the private prison industry</a>, which profits from criminalizing childish behavior and jailing young people.</p>
<p>None of these tactics are making our communities or our schools any safer.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, change is needed, but that will mean taking on the teachersâ unions, the school unions, the educatorsâ associations, and the police unions, not to mention the politicians dependent on their votes and all of the corporations that profit mightily from an industrial school complex.</p>
<p>As weâve seen with other issues, any significant reforms will have to start locally and trickle upwards.</p>
<p>For starters, parents need to be vocal, visible and organized and demand that school officials 1) adopt a policy of positive reinforcement in dealing with behavior issues; 2) minimize the presence in the schools of police officers and cease involving them in student discipline; and 3) insist that all behavioral issues be addressed first and foremost with a childâs parents, before any other disciplinary tactics are attempted.</p>
<p>As I make clear in my bookÂ <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Battlefield-America-War-American-People/dp/1590793099" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Battlefield America: The War on the American People</em></a>, if you want a nation of criminals, treat the citizenry like criminals.</p>
<p>If you want young people who grow up seeing themselves as prisoners, run the schools like prisons.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you want to raise up a generation of freedom fighters, who will actually operate with justice, fairness, accountability and equality towards each other and their government, then run the schools like freedom forums.</p>
<p>Remove the metal detectors and surveillance cameras, re-assign the cops elsewhere, and start treating our nationâs young people like citizens of a republic and not inmates in a police state.</p>

<p>Russian president Vladimir Putin didn&#8217;t respond calmly when UK Prime Minister Theresa May made the decision to expel Russian diplomats from the United Kingdom. Putin warned that the Prime Minister has chosen &#8220;confrontation&#8221; with Moscow as tensions soar.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/931769/vladimir-putin-russia-ww3-uk-confrontation-russian-spy-attack-theresa-may" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to <em>The Express UK</em>,</a> earlier today May announcedÂ <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/931643/russia-uk-theresa-may-attack-latest-diplomats-expelled-vladimir-putin-theresa-may" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats</a>Â as part of a range of measures in response to the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury.Â &#8220;The UK government concluded it was highly likely Russia was responsible for this attack,&#8221; May said.Â  That announcement stuck in Vladimir Putin&#8217;s craw.</p>
<p>It also outraged Putin&#8217;s foreign ministry officials in Moscow and Russiaâs federation council speaker Valentina Matviyenko called on Putin to respond âpromptly and toughlyâ. According to Russiaâs <a href="http://tass.com/politics/994102" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>TASS</em> news agency,</a>Â Matviyenko said, âBritain has blamed Russia without putting forward any charges. Thatâs unprecedented. I believe that this is utterly something unheard of in diplomatic practice. We, <strong>Russia, must react promptly, toughly and proportionately.Â </strong> It is obvious that<strong> this is a mean and shameless provocation with a poorly conceived and written scenario of an ostensibly Russian connection and anti-presidential campaign arranged day by day, aimed at dictating a negative image of Russia to the world community.Â </strong>Nobody can answer an ordinary, simple question,&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://tass.com/politics/994102" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russian Foreign Ministry also put out a public statement on Wednesday.Â </a>&#8220;We believe that the statement British Prime Minister Theresa May made in the parliament on March 14, concerning measures to punish Russia for its alleged involvement in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter, is an <strong>unprecedentedly blatant provocation, which undermines the foundations of dialogue between our countries,</strong>&#8221; the statement reads.</p>
<p>Investigators claim to have identified the substance used to poison Skripal and his daughter was a chemical used by Russia during the Cold War. Skripal, a former Russian spy turned MI6 agent, and his daughter are currently in a critical condition after they were found unconscious in Salisbury, Wiltshire, shortly after 4pm on Sunday, March 4.</p>
<p>Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has insisted Russia had nothing to do with the nerve agent poisoning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Either this was a direct attack by the Russian state against our country or conceivably the country could have lost control of the military grade nerve agent,&#8221; May said. &#8220;This was not just an act of attempted murder in Salisbury â nor just an act against UK.Â <span data-mce-mark="1">It is an affront to the prohibition on the use of chemical weapons. And it is an affront to the rules-based system on which we and our international partners depend.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>It sounds like Russia is continuing to deny that the nation&#8217;s officials had anything to do with theÂ poisoning, while the UK goes off of &#8220;likely&#8221; scenarios rather than provided cold hard evidence of wrongdoing. But that&#8217;s just par for the course in global politics anymore.</p>

Wait, strike that. They&#8217;re walking out of classes to call for further restrictions on protections against unreasonable search and seizure. Nope, that&#8217;s not it either. Wait, I have it: they&#8217;re protesting for greater regulation of self-defense rights. Yup, there we go.</p>
