<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>Due to Singapore's history as a trading port British ships on their way to India, the city-state is a unique mixture various ethnic influences, both from Britain and from other Asian countries. Most relevantly, Chinese and Indian workers moved to Singapore to work at the harbor. Today, a mix of various languages, traditions and religious is prevalent all over the state. Thanks to this foreign influence, Singapore is now one the most diverse cultures in the world, and a mix of traditions and local customs, including Chinese, Malay, Indian and Western influences.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">Singapore stands out for policies around multiculturalism, which are both a recognition of the city's demographic realities and something that shapes them. This includes the management of race, culture and religion.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">Although there is freedom of religion, there are some exceptions. Singapore is home to many religious with an important relevance on the country: Islam (Malay), Hinduism (Indians), Buddhism, Taoism, and folk religion (Chinese), along with a substantial number of Christians of various denominations.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">Whether Singapore follows the premises of multiculturalism or is actually a melting pot, the city-state is the combination of Asian and European cultures. Shaped by Malay, South Asian, East Asian and Eurasian cultures, Singapore has been described as a country where &ldquo;East meets West.&rdquo;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Multiracial and multi-religious harmony is the foundation of Singapore's progress and success, said President Tony Tan Keng Yam, who highlighted it is vital for Singaporeans to protect this multiculturalism.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">&ldquo;We cannot take multiracial peace for granted,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is a big challenge for us in order to maintain our multiracial, multi-religious harmony, and we have to continue to work at it in order to promote understanding.&rdquo;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">Tan also mentioned his visit to the recently opened mosque Masjid Yusof Ishak at Woodlands, where he joined about 400 congregants for an iftar (breaking of fast) session.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8">He highlighted that the iftar event was &ldquo;special&rdquo; for him, since it was held in the mosque named after one of Singapore's presidents. &ldquo;He is a strong promoter of multiculturalism and multiracial understanding. I think all of us can be inspired by his example. He embodied it and did a lot during his term of office to bring all the different races and faiths together,&rdquo; said Tan.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph9">He emphasized the mosque's key role in reaching out to other communities as well. He met with members of the Mosque Management Board and toured a heritage gallery highlighting the late president Softy Ishak's legacy. One of the galleries in the mosque chronicles the Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation and its projects.</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>Neighborhood Police (NPC) Centre for Sengkang is utilizing social media for community reach out. The team at Sengkang created memes as well as videos that garnered over 16,000 likes for the <a target='_blank' href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/Sengkangnpc" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>, highest of all 35 NPCs in whole of Singapore. The online effort for outreach enabled NPC to solve unheard cases. An example is a neighborhood &ldquo;bully&rdquo; roaming Sengkang. NPC officers for Sengkang first received one private message on its page on Facebook detailing one teenage boy cycling around recklessly and harassing pedestrians. The truth was beyond expectation as the boy had been autistic and the family is in dire financial status. NPC officers assisted by linking the family with Social Development Ministry and Mental Health Institute as well as Family Centre located in Sengkang.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">The boy's condition improved thereafter, and complaints were nonexistent. Inspector Kevin, deputy person in charge for the Policing Unit (CPU) had been actively monitoring social media information and conducting roadshows and talks at school assembly. NPC is constantly on alert to contain situation from spiraling out of control, referring specifically on the incident involving the autistic boy. The team reached out for the residents for more details and managed to find out the boy's special needs. The team worked tirelessly to seek information from the father by explaining the whole situation and feedback on the son, and managed to convince the father to open up about the son's autism conditions which may cause the son to act violently. It is then that they found out the family also needed financial assistance. The team coordinated efforts to raise fund from financial aids and medical subsidies. They helped the mother secure a job as well. 6 officers from CPU received PS21 Star Award for Team Service during the Public Service Excellence Awards Ceremony. Officers were happy to see improvement on the boy and the family. CPU always looks out for solutions for long term.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">Facebook page posting feed for suspect's images has contributed the nailing of offenders. Some surrendered voluntarily while many came to offer vital information on the suspect's whereabouts. NPC attributed the victories as being active around social media platforms. A total of six strong members are responsible for monitoring Facebook page posting every day. Memes as well as creative videos are created to attract higher amount of viewers. The Facebook profile page has come a long way since being set up on December 2012, with only 2,000 likes. The five times increase in likes can be attributed to the CPU team's effort to create entertaining yet insightful materials. The contents are all modern and resonate with current pop-culture. The page is constantly updated once in few days. Unique materials are posted for every updates.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">More people, especially Sengkang residents have been approaching CPU to divulge information due to the page on Facebook. There was a particular case where a man insulted a women, and a civic minded resident provided information to NPC when the rude man's photos was published on Facebook. The suspect knew his picture was exposed online, hence decided to give in voluntarily after two days. Stern warning was provided to the man. Another case involved illegal usage of stranger's ATM card to withdraw money. The illegal act was committed by a woman. CCTV footage revealed an accomplice, which is also another woman during the taking place of the crime. The culprits surrendered almost immediately after catching wind that their photos were published on NPC's Facebook profile page. Another case was a theft occurring at a grocery shop where a thief stole groceries from the store. Similar to the previous cases, the suspect's photos were uploaded to the Facebook profile page, with the source being taken from CCTV footage. The neighbours of the thief reported on the thief's whereabouts and the culprit was arrested after only 2 days.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph5">Online media is the new information center and the Police Force for Singapore (SPF) adapted to the modern approach. Social media has been utilized since 2009 to engage with the public. Alll 35 NPCs have maintained their own page on Facebook. It has been a richly rewarding solution from the public outreach via social platform media. The top 3 NPC page on Facebook with highest likes are Sengkang at top spot, Punggol claiming 2nd spot and Ang Mo Kio at 3rd spot.</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>This day, finding a work, especially the matches one with someone's skill might be a tough challenge. An Education Minister of Singapore has found this program, which now is being tested at the university degree. He implemented this program after research from the Swiss and German system. This system found a match to be inserted into the curriculum of the universities, as it will boost their knowledge and start up the early training for the work ground after they graduate. This program also makes an active and positive involvement from the company and make advantages between the related side.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">The university has given the opportunity to the company by letting them teach the student while they still try to reach their degree. The company will actively do the research in order to create a knowledge to be fit in perfectly with the curriculum for the students. It looks like they give the apprenticeship training system for the new apprentice, but the different is from where they started to learn. This way, a company will have a chance to produce more competent student to have an ethical culture of work later. The company can also recruit the potential and match skilled student to work for their company after they graduate. All they need to do is make an interesting job offer for the student to place them on.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">When the company gets their advantages, students also have their advantages by following this program. They have been prepared early to get into the work world so they will run easily to enhance their skill for the company when the time comes. The necessary skills are being taught to them to add their potential. This way, they will not mismatch their ability versus the work field in which they will work in.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">The students will learn the theory in the classroom, and implemented their knowledge in practice in the company. They will be paid too for what they worked for. This is happening to be a reality simulation of the world of work. They will peek the inside of the company to which they will be worked in, and they will adapt to it. Hopefully, they can work and get along with the company after graduate.</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>Singapore, as the tourism and business destination, has a lot of visitors come by and spent a short-term living on it. The impact is, there are a very lot of options to choose from where somebody wants to stay and spend a night(s). This includes hotels, flat, apartments, condos, etc. But lately, one type of the lodging has been issued as a potential problem to Singapore people and the stakeholder. This lodging we talk about is Home Share, which is Singaporean private and public homeowners rented their properties to the visitors. Sites like <a target='_blank' href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> and <a target='_blank' href="https://www.pandabed.com/" target="_blank">PandaBed</a> offer home share on their list of options. Airbnb is one of the biggest that providing this home share on their list. They admit that they have about 6,000 properties listed on home share menu. The examples are Kallang Shophouse ($249/night), Tiong Bahru Flat ($114), and a small room at East Coast with a balcony ($48). PandaBed is an online community for like-minded homeowners and travelers to list, discover and book trustworthy homes, apartments, villa, b&amp;b and homestay across Asia. They aim to provide an authentic and trustworthy hosting or traveling experience for the community. Their PeerMatch feature enables host and guest to be connected in areas like culture, language and religion. <br />
&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">One thing should be considered is a home share is not a legal activity in Singapore. It has ruled under the law which stated that it is illegal for private and public homeowners to lease their properties for less than six months. For breaking this rule, the homeowner can be fined up to $200 and jailed for up to a year.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">There are a lot of pros and cons about the rules regulate this home share business. At the cons side, Housing of the Development Board stated that this business will make an effect on the environment because of the high turnover between the occupants of the property. They have worried about the safety of the environment. This issue has been reinforced by the cons opinions from the people experiencing this problem. They stated that tourists who rent the property is more reckless and not as careful as the residents, like throwing the cigarettes butt, how they treat the facilities (Airbnb often offers the facility, such as gym, to the transient tourist), and also afraid of a very easy access of people to get in and get out of the residents near them without knowing who they are, and make them prone to criminalities. Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has noted that in 2013, there were 231 reports of this complaints, and keep increasing in 2014 as much as 375 reports, and in 2015, 377 reports. Singapore Hotels Association also in the cons side since the home share will make a serious competition with hotels and serviced apartment. Besides, the service they provided and the cleanliness won't be standardized as the hotel does. It will affect the tourist opinion of Singapore as a travel destination. 2017 is on track to hit over 700 cases of short-term rentals reported to the government.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">Nevertheless, some people might think different and have no problem with this business. They stated that one should have a freedom to decide what to do with their own properties. And it will be saved if there's a rule for their guests to be screened up before accepted. Some also said this home share can make an immersive cultural hub. And it's an organic way to learn the city and the inhabitants, better than a hotel.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph5">The government has a long thought process and a debate about to legalize or not legalize this business activity. On one hand, it makes advantages for the tourists and the homeowner, and on the other hand, they will come up with risks. They are not yet decided whether to legalize it or not, but they still watched closely to this activity with all the consideration, since it is a disruptive technology. Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for National Development has stated that if this activity legalized, then there must be rules to ensure the equity of all the stakeholders.</div>

He enrolled in the Singapore School for the Deaf to and become proficient at sign language after nine years of study. Currently, he resides with his brother and sister at their home in Little India. His siblings are more than supportive of his career, and are proud of his efforts.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">His sister admits that there were reasons to be apprehensive when Mr. Chua was first offered the job. She was unsure about his communication skills when it came to customer interaction. These days, she feels a sense of relief and happiness when his work is highlighted and praised by others.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10">The director of the <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="http://sadeaf.org.sg/">Singapore Association for the Deaf</a> has noticed Mr. Chua. Ms. Sylvia Teng notes that his long lasting employment and loyal work ethic is laudable, as are the relationships he builds with others. The loyalty and commitment he has shown is what sets him apart from the others.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph11">Louis Chua notes that it takes patience to work alongside deaf people, but it is not impossible. He fees that the support of coworkers and customers has had a lot to do with his success in life as well. Either way, Mr. Chua is a constant fixture at the FairPrice supermarket and continues to make the people around him smile.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph12">Employment Support For Deaf Individuals</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph13">Ms. Teng notes that deaf individuals are easily employable in varied careers, but find it hard to gain initial employment. There are far too many employers that do not provide basic facilities for the deaf employees, such as communicating via notes and sign language. This hampers their career growth, making it difficult for them to reach better positions. She says that employers must be sensitized on the issue and learn how to work alongside differently-abled people.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph14">Furthermore, she offers methods of interaction in a professional setup with deaf people. The best way to move forward is to reiterate instructions by noting them down and showing it to them. Ask them if there is any issue or if they need anything at all. For employers, having a sign language facilitation workshop is a must. Engaging with deaf people requires patience, but more importantly, respect.</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>Singlish words have been accepted and adopted into the <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/"><strong>oxford dictionary</strong></a>. The publishing bureau gives credit to the language as being part of the community and thus the need to be incorporated in such a huge publication project.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">Some of the terms being used in Singlish have been adopted from the Chinese speaking inhabitants and another linguistic group called the Malay. The words are as a result of language dynamics that have brought about the sense and validity for use as a language. These singlish terms are more so the most commonly used words by the people of Singapore.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">It takes a long period of time for some words in any dialect to gain the respect and credibility of being recognized as words of good quality. Academicians in the field of literature and languages from Singapore acknowledge that Singlish being incorporate into an international word reference book is a major breakthrough.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">There should be a rise in the way Singaporeans value and gauge their pride and value as it patterns to their take on others. This will help in gaining confidence in the future endeavors when it comes to innovation and bringing of new dialects. The current status of the way the people of Singapore value themselves is not as expected and should now.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">For those people speaking Singlish , it has been their believe for a fact that they would one day in the future have their mode of communication being an integral part of their way of life. There has been numerous times when terms used in English by the Singaporeans has been added into the dictionary. Lah as well as Sinseh makes some of the words that have ever been added into oxford dictionary, some years back.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">Adding Singlish words into the <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/"><strong>dictionary of Oxford</strong></a> is major breakthrough when it comes to raising the identity status of Singapore. This has been received well and positively by the iconic celebrities as it would open various opportunities and niches for them to explore and exploit. It has been good news to musicians and song writers as they now have to bring in a new twist to sprinkle their rhyme and rhythm with the Singlish words. This comes as a wakeup call to many other artistes to spread out and give their audiences with a new taste of music with the new Singlish terms, now formerly accepted.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">Singlish does not necessarily mean that the formal English will be squirted, rather it is a language that has found a people in their inhabitants and at a time that was defined to bring out the language. New words will be there, today, tomorrow and in the new future, the English previously known and understood will not turn to being obsolete. Simply, the language is an added advantage to their mode of communication and will serve to their unity. Other communities and interested people willing to know and understand the language are also at liberty to do so.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8">Grammar is the major constituent in English, whereas there are Singlish words that can substitute those means that all will be fine, with the mode of communication and the understanding of other people. The naivety will come to an end when people understand that this is not a non-familiar scenario as there are also some words that are French and also used in English.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">For many people in Singapore, Singlish has been their favorite and continues to being one. It is a huge disillusion for them that there are a certain people that still perceive Singlish as being incorrect and uncivilized. The people that put down the Singlish words might have felt the need, urgency and logic of being incorporated into the dictionary.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph10">There are still those that are finding it confusing for the inclusion of those words into English dictionary. They are of the opinion that, since the language might have been brought or borrowed from the Malay dialect. It is a surprise for them that an English words regulator as <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/">Oxford</a> can allow such a move. It is bad English to them, bad English trying to find its spot and maybe stand out to the rest of the world. FYI.

<p><strong>Woodlands Set for Makeover as Star Destination of the North:</strong></p>
<p>In April 2017 Minister for National Development Mr Lawrence Wong announced the renewal plans for Woodlands, at the launch of the Remaking Our Heartland (ROH) exhibition for Woodlands.</p>
<p>Woodlands, Toa Payoh and Pasir Ris are the latest batch of towns to be  renewed under the ROH programme. The renewal plans will focus on  strengthening the character, community, and connectivity of each town.</p>
<p>In drawing up the rejuvenation plans, HDB had actively engaged residents and stakeholders to seek their views and suggestions on the plans. For the first time, residents from the three towns were invited in the early stages of the planning, to participate in Focus Group Discussions (FGDs). A total of 11 discussion sessions was conducted, involving some 400 residents and community stakeholders from the three towns. With the views gathered from residents, HDB has refined the plans for each town to ensure that the improvements will benefit residents of all ages.</p>
<p>The plans for Woodlands comprise several major improvements to transform the town into the &ldquo;Star Destination of the North&rdquo;, in keeping with its status as the northern regional centre and gateway to Singapore.<br />
<br />
Six "Star Attractions", in the form of new recreational and residential developments, will be introduced to revitalise Woodlands. The existing neighbourhood centres in Woodlands will also be enhanced to bring more greenery and better connectivity to the town.<br />
<br />
The Woodlands Regional Centre, comprising Woodlands Central and Woodlands North Coast, is set to become an even more vibrant hub of activity, with better connectivity and new commercial and residential developments.<br />
<br />
As part of the upcoming Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL), three new MRT stations will be introduced in Woodlands by 2019 to serve residents in the town. This will be joined to the future Johor Bahru &ndash; Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link. Together with the future North-South Corridor, travel from the north to the rest of Singapore will be seamless and convenient. <br />
<br />
In Woodlands Central, a new Town Plaza will be built next to the Woodlands MRT station, in response to residents' suggestion for a bigger community space. This will offer a convenient and vibrant community node for Woodlands residents to come together to participate in community events.<br />
<br />
Residents can also look forward to new housing developments in Woodlands. Within Woodlands Central, there will be a landmark residential development located near the MRT station, integrated with a vibrant Pedestrian Mall with commercial and community facilities. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
In Woodlands North Coast, a new residential development will offer a &ldquo;Housing-in-the-Woods&rdquo; experience. Drawing from its natural setting and proximity to Admiralty Park, lush landscaping will be introduced as green extensions from Admiralty Park. The project will leverage on the hilly terrain, so residents will be able to enjoy good views of the park and the Straits of Johor.<br />
<br />
Beyond new housing developments, the Woodlands Waterfront &ndash; a popular recreation spot in the northern tip &ndash; will be transformed. A new rustic park, with trails and a nature promenade, will enable residents to enjoy abundant greenery even as they unwind by the waterfront.<br />
<br />
In response to residents' suggestions for a direct connection from Woodlands Central to the Woodlands waterfront, a new scenic WoodsVista Gallery will be developed to connect the two areas. Set amidst lush greenery, the WoodsVista Gallery will be a 1.9-kilometre-long community link with dedicated cycling and pedestrian paths. Residents will be able to walk, jog or cycle seamlessly from the Woodlands MRT station to the waterfront; or simply relax and take in scenic views of the town at strategically located rest points and activity nodes.<br />
<br />
The Woodlands Town Garden located at Marsiling will be upgraded and expanded into a new &ldquo;Discovery Playground&rdquo;, where residents can enjoy the garden anew and learn about the history of the town. It will feature a new boardwalk, children's playground, a heritage corner and a learning lane with storyboards to showcase the heritage of the town. When completed, the revamped Woodlands Town Garden will be renamed Marsiling Park, and will offer yet another recreational spot for Woodlands residents.<br />
<br />
Next to the upcoming Woodlands South MRT station on the TEL, a new integrated healthcare complex will be developed. To be called the Woodlands Health Campus, it will comprise a new acute care hospital, community hospital and a long-term care facility. Designed to integrate with a new park, the healthcare complex will open in phases from 2022, bringing healthcare facilities closer to home, and providing better support for elderly residents to age in place.<br />
<br />
On the eastern side of Woodlands, residents can look forward to a new Community Nexus right next to the Admiralty MRT station. Located in this Community Nexus is the integrated development, Kampung Admiralty, which is expected to be completed in 3rd quarter this year. It will house a range of facilities such as a medical centre, eldercare and childcare centres, a hawker centre, dining and retail outlets, as well as housing for the elderly. Together with existing facilities such as Admiralty Place Neighbourhood Centre and Woodlands Galaxy Community Club, the Community Nexus will serve as a one-stop hub of facilities for all ages. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The existing park connector that runs from the east to the west of Woodlands will be transformed into a &lsquo;Social Corridor', with lush greenery, community gardens and 3-Generation facilities along the park connector and MRT viaduct. Residents are invited to give their suggestions on how the community spaces can be used, during the exhibition.<br />
<br />
Beyond the six star attractions, the existing neighbourhoods in Woodlands will also be enhanced. These improvements include rejuvenating the neighbourhoods, enhancing the greenery, and improving connectivity within the town.</p>
