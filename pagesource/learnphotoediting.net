  TRANSFORMING PHOTOS OF REAL PEOPLE INTO CARICATURES
 
  
  </h2>

 <p>
<strong> Photomanipulation +  Retouching + Color Grading Tutorial </strong>

 <br /> <br />

We will be covering a lot of things in this massive tutorial. You will learn step by step how you can create any cartoon character you imagine using photomanipulation, retouching and color grading techniques. With only <b>Photoshop</b> and stock photos (or your own) you can create a unique caricature that can be a logo, a mascot for a product, a character in an ad, etc.. You can of course use the same techniques explained in this tutorial, in a more subtle way, to spice up your portraits or images.
 <br /> <br />
This tutorial has a massive 89 steps detailing the entire process to achieve the image above and don't worry, all my tutorials can be done by anyone who has basic knowledge of Photoshop.  Unlike other tutorials you'll sometimes see out there, you don't need to be a skilled digital painter to achieve the same results I get here - as I'm not a good digital painter myself ;)

<strong>Advanced Retouching Tutorial </strong>

 <br /> <br />

In this <b>130-minute video tutorial</b> I will show you different retouching techniques and tricks that will help you transform regular people into eye-popping characters. In this Photoshop tutorial, we will enhance the facial features of the man and the woman giving them a funny cartoonish look perfect for our artwork. We will then work on colors and add a background that will mesh well with our characters. In this case, I choose a background that would give the impression that those two were in an insane asylum!

<strong> Retouching Tutorial </strong>

Retouching is something photographers always end up doing when taking portraits but one particular popular look, one that we often see in magazines or ads for beauty products is the flawless "airbrushed" look. Well, there's no airbrushing going on in this <b>Photoshop tutorial</b> but what we will do here is take the unedited photo of a model with minimal make up and we will "glam it up", get rid of all imperfection and finally create the type of photo we can often see in beauty product ads and fashion magazines. Click the link below to learn more.
<br /> <br />
*Update* For this retouching tutorial, I am using a completely different technique than the one I used for the NEW retouching tutorial at the top of this page. Both techniques are really useful and can be used for different situations.

TURN A PHOTO INTO A "REALITY SHOW" POSTER AD
  
  </h2>

 <p>
<strong>Advanced Color Grading Tutorial </strong>

 <br /> <br />

In this <b>52-minute video tutorial</b> we will use advanced color grading techniques to create a <b>tone mapping effect</b> without the use of any plugins or 3rd party software, we'll only be using Photoshop and what comes with it. We will start out with a photo taken with the aid of an off-the-camera flash and turn it into some sort of "reality show" poster ad. Taking a photo while using an additional fill-light or reflectors helps us retain a lot of details in the shadows and highlights which make it easier in post-production to really push the color grading.
<br /> <br />
This tutorial will be really helpful to anyone who wants to give their photos a professional look with richer colors and higher contrasts. Click the link below to learn more.

  PUSHING A RAW PHOTO TO THE MAX IN PHOTOSHOP
 
  
  </h2>

 <p>
<strong> Color Grading Tutorial </strong>

 <br /> <br />

In this <b>57-Minute Video Tutorial</b> I take a RAW photo and transform it into something much more interesting by pushing the color grading to the max. I start off in the Photoshop RAW photo editor (Camera Raw) and go through my usual workflow to prepare the photo for an extreme transformation in Photoshop. Then I show you all the steps I took and techniques I used to achieve the image you see right above!
 <br /> <br />
Shooting RAW is so essential in my opinion to really get the most out of your photos, to be able to bring back the details in the shadows and highlights but also to be able to bring back colors that could have been lost if you shot JPEGs.
 <br /> <br />

TURN A PHOTO WITH STRONG SHADOWS & HIGHLIGHTS INTO SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A HDR PHOTO
  
  </h2>

 <p>
<strong>Advanced Color Grading Tutorial </strong>

 <br /> <br />

In this <b>45-minute video tutorial</b> I will show you how you can get the most out of a RAW photo especially when your subject or the sky couldn't be properly exposed. When you take photos in nature and you don't have with you a reflector, especially when the sun is going down and you want to capture it along with your subject, you'll run into some problems. Either the sky will be blown out or your subject will be too dark. You can however with Photoshop correct that problem, bring out hidden details in the shadows and highlights as well as colors you didn't think were there. If you want to make your photos "pop" more, this is the tutorial for you!

<strong> Photo Manipulation + Compositing Tutorial </strong>

 <br /> <br />

Compositing is a very useful procedure that consist of combining visual elements from separate sources into a single image - it is a process used for many purposes but it is especially useful for creating a fantasy background for your model/character/subject. Compositing is a tool anyone who wants to spice up their images need in their toolbox.
 <br /> <br />
 In this <b>Photoshop tutorial</b>, I used compositing to create a burning city with crumbling buildings that served as a backdrop for my post-apocalyptic scene and then I used photomanipulation to transform regular people into the flesh-eating zombies you see in the foreground!

TAKE YOUR SKILLS TO THE NEXT LEVEL

<p>

<img src="newindex/gralpe3.jpg" width="136" height="137" align="left"/><strong>
 &nbsp;<span style="color: #000;">Hi, my name is Patrick Lavigne and I'm a professional graphic artist, photo editor, colorist (photo & video) and photographer. 
<br /><br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;  My main goal with this site is to teach you how you can create better photos by spending as little money as possible and it all starts with photo editing.</span><br /><br />


 No, you don't need a $3000 camera or a $1500 lens to take professional quality photos. In fact, the difference you will notice between a photo taken with an entry level DSLR camera + the kit lens and the same photo taken with the Canon 5D Mark IV for example is <b>minimal</b> compare to the difference you'll notice between one photo expertly edited in Photoshop and the same that wasn't. If you already have Photoshop,</strong> <i>(you can download the free trial for 7 days btw)</i> <strong>you can improve your photos dramatically by learning how to properly color correct and color grade. 
<br /><br />
Then, you can take your photos to an whole new level if you can master the art of what we call photomanipulation, compositing and retouching. By mastering those techniques, you will be able to turn your photos into digital art! <br /><br /></strong>
   
  
 <u>  Some sites are selling their tutorials $25+ a piece, at only $5 per tutorial, I could perhaps charge $100+ for all of them, but I want to give you a MUCH better deal than that! When you join this site, you pay a one-time fee of <del>$49</del> <b><span style="color:#3a83ae">$39 (Limited Time Offer)</span></b> for a <b>Lifetime Membership</b> which gives you access to <strong> ALL</strong> tutorials. As I add more tutorials, the price will go up accordingly - by securing your lifetime membership now, you will have access to all the future tutorials absolutely <b>FREE</b>!! </u>
   
   
   <br /> <br />
 
<i>All source images for the tutorials are supplied to you so you'll be able to do exactly what I did. The tutorials were all done using <b>Photoshop CS5 or Photoshop CC</b> but as long as you have version CS5 or newer, you're fine! While a lot can be done with CS3/CS4, you will be limited when doing my tutorials. If you want to try out a more recent version, Adobe offers a Free 7-day trial. As for Photoshop Elements, it is definitely not recommended here as you'll probably feel like you're in an alternate universe following my tutorials! Happened a few times!</i>
  <br /> <br />


<span style="color:#295b7e">If you are on this website and have read until this point, it's because you are a motivated artist that wants to improve and you realize that to fully unleash your talent, you need the technical knowledge you might be missing to fully express it.
<br /> <br />
Learning all the ways you can edit your photos and images is like someone that finally learns the proper drawing techniques. Before, the person was making interesting doodles, now he/she's creating works of art. The talent was there but it was not fully utilized. And it's the same thing with digital art and photo editing, once you learn the proper methods, you then unleash the creativity in you that couldn't fully be expressed before.
<br /> <br />
What you'll learn on this site is just the start, a glimpse of what's possible for you to achieve. By joining this site and practicing what I'll teach you, I firmly believe that you too can become a photo/image editing expert. You may doubt your potential at first but I guarantee you that after surprising yourself a few times with better than expected results, your confidence will grow and you will be believing in your true potential.

<br /> <br />
It's important to have goals and that's why you are here, if it's career goals (photography, digital artist), to paraphrase the great Jim Rohn, get the skills, take the classes, <b>be more valuable</b>. If it's personal goals (hobby), push yourself, get the knowledge and <b>accomplish what you want to accomplish</b>.</span>



 
  <br /> <br />
 <b>If for any reasons you are not completely satisfied with my training tutorials, I'm offering you a 60-day, no questions asked, money back guarantee:</b>
  <br /> <br />
<i>If you don't think LearnPhotoEditing is worth it, simply drop me an email - and you'll get all your money back instantly.</i>
