<p>Touch typing improves typing speed and accuracy. A touch typist never looks at the keyboard. The fingers hit the right keys by force of habit. The typist is entirely focused on the text being typed, reading the words and phrases as the fingers type the text reflexively. Touch typing can be learned by performing special exercises.</p><p>Stage one of the process begins with learning the home row of the keyboard (the row beginning with the Caps Lock key). Looking at the keyboard is strictly forbidden. This is followed by learning the lower and upper rows, the numbers row, upper-case letters and special symbols.</p><p>Stage two involves memorizing frequently used syllables and typing words containing these syllables.</p><p>Stage three involves typing actual text to perfect the skills acquired.</p></div><div class="fl w35"> <a href="/typing-instructions.html" title="Touch Typing Technique">

Is it me, or do freeware authors have the right idea, that keeping things simple makes it works better?<br />Somehow, all these digital lockdowns that many companies try to add get confusing, annoying,   so intolerable that once you find a freeware like this, you ditch their annoyware once and for all!!!</p><p class="ar fi fm">Junk Buster</p></div><div class="gb"><p>I have been a typical two finger plunker for more than forty years!
