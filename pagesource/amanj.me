                    <p>I am, Amanj Sherwany, a Software Engineer at

                    programming related. I have been working as a research

                        of Informatics</a>
                    of the <a href="http://www.usi.ch"> University of Lugano
                      (USI)</a>. I was working at the <a

                    Engineering at <a href="http://www.suh-edu.com/">
                      Salahaddin University</a>, and graduated in 2006. I am

                    <p>I used to be a poet, but the deeper I go into computer
                        science, the less talented I get! Seriously, being a
                        computer scientist makes you a senseless guy! I also
                        enjoy reading Kurdish poetry, both old and new. I adore
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haji_Qadir_Koyi">
                            Hajî Qadirî Koyî</a>, and I think he was one very unique
                        guy. I also enjoy

                    <p>By now, you may have noticed that I am using Wikipedia
                        a lot, most of my links in the above two paragraphs
                        were from Wikipedia. This is normal, as I am an
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOSS">Open
                            Source</a> guy and I love free and open source contents.
                        I am an open source advocate, and have given several seminars
                        about this topic in my city (to be more specific at
                        Software Engineering department at Salahaddin University).</p>

                    <p>I enjoy playing badminton and table tennis. I also used
                        to be a chess player, but haven't practiced regularly
                        since 2004. I like building toys using
