The most stunning news for many users may be that Facebook not only permits but encourages developers to collect data.
The social media giant opened its doors to broad data collection back in 2007 so that outside developers could build apps and programs on top of Facebook’s open platform. Today third party apps mine tons of detailed personal data on Facebook’s 1.86 billion users every day. The info can include users’ ages, locations, groups they belong to and pages they’ve liked.
Facebook does prohibit selling or giving away data collected by a third party. It was Cambridge University professor Aleksandr Kogan who developed the “ThisIsYourDigitalLife” app and gave the collected data to Cambridge Analytica.
There are steps social media users can take to protect the safety and security of their personal information. You do have some control over where your data lands. Start by thinking about what you are doing on Facebook. Before you reveal any data, consider why you are handing over personal information.
“You should ask yourself, ‘Do I know what people are going to do with my data?’” said Russ Schrader, executive director of the National Cyber Security Alliance. Schrader says the advice he offers may not be foolproof, but it can go a long way to protect your data from being used without your consent.
<strong>Question why you’re giving certain information</strong>. “If you’re taking an online quiz, that quiz doesn’t need to know your address and phone number. Be careful if you feel (uncomfortable) disclosing info to certain questions. Vendors can be putting together a profile on you based on the info you give.”
<strong>Find your online comfort level.</strong> “Set your privacy settings to a comfort level good for you. Urge people to really think about it deeply.”
<strong>Share with care.</strong> “What you put on the web can last a lifetime,” he said. “Before posting about yourself with others, think about how it will be perceived now and in the future.”
<strong>Clean House</strong>. “The same way you spring clean your house, the same needs to be done for your computer. Look at all your apps and ask what are they trying to find out about you. Get rid of the apps you aren’t using.”
<strong>Secure devices.</strong> “Use facial recognition or long pass phrases instead of passwords,” he said. “Passwords with special characters are hard to crack, but also hard to remember. Longer phrases are better, like ‘Mary had a little lamb.’ Find a pass phrase that is something long that you’ll remember and will be difficult to replicate.”
<strong>Adopt two-step verification.</strong> “Your most important sites, like banking and health apps, should have a code or fingerprint after the pass codes.”

Males may not be able to say it out loud, but they do leave obvious clues when their feelings have taken a turn for the romantic. Here are signs that he’s falling for you.
<ol>
 	<li><strong> He’ll start the conversation</strong></li>
</ol>
He’ll seek you out in a crowd to start a conversation. When he runs out of social chitchat, he’ll look for more topics to discuss with you. He’ll seek you out in the office to ask advice on his latest work project or share office gossip. The longer he lingers, the more he wants to get to know you.
<ol start="2">
 	<li><strong> He’s on his best behavior.</strong></li>
</ol>
He knows that politeness is an attractive trait, and he wants you to think he’s the kind of guy you’d take home to meet Mom and Day. If you do invite him for dinner with the folks, he hopes the verdict will be “he’s such a nice boy.” Does he open doors for you? Does he make sure he doesn’t run over you in conversation? Minding manners is a significant clue.
<ol start="3">
 	<li><strong> He offers compliments.</strong></li>
</ol>
If he can’t come right out and say he really, really likes you, the tongue-tied Lothario will hide his feelings behind compliments. He likes your new hairstyle, that dress looks great on you, your presentation speech was killer, you really deserved that pay raise, etc., etc. He thinks this is a great way to let you know that he finds you attractive.
<ol start="4">
 	<li><strong> He asks about your boyfriend.</strong></li>
</ol>
He wants to know whether you’re single or if your boyfriend is watching from across the crowded room.  Definitely, he wants to know if he’s as good looking as your current, so he’ll ask to see a picture. Is it serious, or is there room for him in your heart?
<ol start="5">
 	<li><strong> He keeps his promises.</strong></li>
</ol>
Did he offer to lend you that great book he says is the next great American novel, and then somehow never got around to bringing it in? Did he agree to help you move but never showed up on the appointed day? Men who are interested will jump at the chance to win your favor, and once they’ve promised, they’ll follow through.
<ol start="6">
 	<li><strong> He’s specific about time and place.</strong></li>
</ol>
Does he make vague suggestions about getting together for lunch but never offers a specific day?  If he’s attracted to you, he’ll initiate a firm invitation and follow up with day, time and place. He’ll confirm the day before that the date is still on. He wants to see you, and he’s not going to miss out on the opportunity by messing up the details.

We copy the rich and famous for ideas on where to go on vacation, what to order in chic restaurants and what to drink in fancy bars. Why not let celebs provide some guidance as wedding season approaches? They come up with fun ideas for wedding venues and romantic themes from proposals to honeymoons. Here are some wedding ideas to spark your wedding creativity, thanks to some of your favorite celebs.
<strong>Pick a Cute Theme Like John Stamos</strong>
<strong>John Stamos</strong> proposed to his princess bride <strong>Caitlin McHugh</strong> in front of Sleeping Beauty’s castle at Disneyland. "I asked...she said yes! ...And we lived happily ever after&#x1f48d;," he wrote under an Instagram photo of the moment. They held an evening wedding ceremony in Los Angeles and then continued the Disney-themed romance by flying off to Florid a to honeymoon in Orlando's Disney World.
<strong>Build Your Own Wedding Chapel à la Ed Sheeran</strong>
Newly engaged <strong>Ed Sheeran</strong> plans to build a Saxon-style chapel at his sprawling country home in Suffolk County, England. Rumors say he and fiancée <strong>Cherry Seaborn</strong> would most likely use the chapel as their own wedding venue. Designs call for a 48-foot-high round tower and room to seat around 24 people.
<strong>Pick Up an Affordable Wedding Outfit Like Emily Ratajkowski</strong>
Follow in the footsteps of model <strong>Emily Ratajkowski</strong> and drop in to your local Zara to choose a bridal outfit off the rack. Ratajkowski showed up for her New York City courthouse nuptials with <strong>Sebastian Bear-McClard </strong>rocking a belted jacket and trousers in mustard yellow. But it wasn’t just the color and the cut that stunned the fashion world. The chic monochromatic pantsuit carried a price tag that topped out at a whopping $200.
<strong>Match Paris Hilton’s Multiple Outfit Changes </strong>
<strong>Paris Hilton</strong> is expected to outdo brides Serena Williams and Kate Upton in the wedding day quick-change department. Williams and Upton spurred the 2017 trend of wearing a second and even a third wedding dress on the big day. "I love an outfit change. It's important to have the pre-wedding dress, the wedding dress, and the after party," Hilton told <em>E! News</em>. And she didn’t even count a going-away outfit as she departs with new husband <strong>Chris Zylka.</strong>
<strong>Elope</strong>
<strong>Jordan Peele</strong> and <strong>Chelsea Peretti</strong> may have set a record for keeping a wedding under wraps. The pair escaped to the Big Sur mountains without telling a soul—except their dog. "We went to Big Sur, ever heard of it?" she joked on the <em>Conan </em>show. "It's beautiful—oceans, mountains. We were married by a woman named Soaring, like soaring above the clouds, and our dog was there, and that was it. No guests… And then Big Sur, like, fell into the ocean right after that, so I hope it's not a bad omen."

Studies show adolescents and young adults who vape are three times more likely to start smoking traditional cigarettes than those who don't sample e-cigarettes. Researchers at Dartmouth College’s Norris Cotton Cancer Center say vaping acts as a gateway that leads people to start a real smoking habit. E-cigarette manufacturers have been promoting their product as a way to quit smoking traditional tobacco.
Marketing e-cigarettes as a way to quit or reduce smoking has done damage, mostly to young people, said the study's lead author Samir Soneji, PhD. Soneji is an associate professor at The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice.
“Although the tobacco industry markets e-cigarettes as a tool to help adult smokers quit smoking, e-cigarette use actually only marginally increases the number of adult cigarette smokers who are able to successfully quit,” he said.
E-cigarette use among high school students soared from 1.5 percent in 2011 to 16 percent in 2015. That year, e-cigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco product of choice for young people in the U.S.
What’s behind the surge in e-cigarette use? Younger, would-be vapers are attracted by fruity flavors and the e-cigarette’s high profile in popular culture. Soneji said that’s the main attraction for youths interested in the devices. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration should focus on those characteristics in its efforts to restrict e-cigarettes, he said.
The Dartmouth study compared current smokers who use e-cigarettes to quit smoking and never-smokers who start smoking by using e-cigarettes and then move on to long-term use of traditional cigarettes.
The scientists estimate that about 2,070 cigarette-smoking adults in America quit in 2015 with the help of e-cigarettes. At the same time, however, an additional 168,000 adolescents and young adults who had never smoked cigarettes started smoking daily after they first began with e-cigarettes. Researchers based their estimates on a model that examined 2014 census data, published literature and surveys on e-cigarette usage.
Smokers who were able to quit using e-cigarettes would likely gain back about five years of their lives, the researchers estimate.  Countering that good news is the impact smoking will have on the non-smokers who would never have started unless they sampled e-cigarettes. Smoking from the time of adolescence and young adulthood on average cuts 10 years off a person's life.
Scientists added up both sides of the equation and estimated that 2014 vaping could cost a total of 1.5 million years of life in the future. That estimate takes into account the number of years gained for current smokers who use e-cigarettes to stop smoking.
“The harms of e-cigarette use among adolescents and young adults are serious,” said Soneji, who is also an associate professor of health policy at Dartmouth’s Geisel School of Medicine. “Kids who vape are more likely to start smoking cigarettes—notably kids who were otherwise not at a high risk of starting to smoke.”

Start with a playful appetizer that turns the tried-and-true corned beef sandwich inside out. This lettuce wrap is filled with cooked cabbage leaves, herbed mayo, rye bread and corned beef. Dinner offers a surprise that’s more than the just the ordinary twice-baked potato. Hidden beneath a golden mashed potato top crust lies a rich beef and vegetable filling for an innovative take on shepherd’s pie. There’s no blarney in saying both dishes from the Food Network Kitchen go great with green beer and Irish soda bread.
<strong>Corned Beef and Cabbage Rolls</strong>
<em>Ingredients:</em>
6 Savoy cabbage leaves
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup chopped parsley and/or dill
2 slices rye bread
1/2 pound corned beef
1 spoonful whole-grain mustard
<em>Directions:</em>
Cook cabbage leaves in boiling water, about 2 minutes. Rinse under cold water and pat dry; slice in half. Mix mayonnaise and parsley and/or dill; spread on the cabbage leaves. Cut rye bread into strips. Slice corned beef into strips and toss with mustard. Top the cabbage leaves with a few strips each of the bread and corned beef. Roll up and slice in half.
<strong>Shepherd's Pie Potato Bowls</strong>
<em>Ingredients:</em>
<ul>
 	<li>4 large russet potatoes (about 3 pounds)</li>
 	<li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter plus 1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
 	<li>1/4 cup whole milk</li>
 	<li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
 	<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
 	<li>1/4 cup chopped fresh chives</li>
 	<li>1 small carrot, chopped</li>
 	<li>12 ounces ground beef chuck</li>
 	<li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
 	<li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
 	<li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
 	<li>1/3 cup frozen peas, thawed</li>
</ul>
<em>Directions:</em>
Prick the potatoes all over with a fork and brush them with 1 tablespoon melted butter. Put on a microwave-safe plate and microwave, flipping halfway, until fork tender, about 20 minutes. (Alternately, bake in the oven at 400 degrees F on a baking sheet until cooked through and fork tender, about 1 hour.) Let cool slightly.
Cut a 1/4-inch-thick slice off the top of each potato. Carefully scoop out the flesh into a medium bowl and mash with the milk, sour cream, 2 tablespoons butter and 1 teaspoon salt using a fork or potato masher. Fold in the chives. Put the potato bowls on a baking sheet.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the carrots and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the beef and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until cooked through, about 4 minutes. Stir in the Worcestershire, tomato paste, thyme, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 cup water and bring to a boil, and then reduce heat and cook until the beef and carrots are coated in sauce with a little extra sitting on the bottom of the pan, about 1 minute. Stir in the peas until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes more.
Spoon the beef mixture into the potato bowls. Spoon or pipe the mashed potatoes on top of the beef mixture and bake until heated through and the potatoes brown on top, about 15 minutes. Cut the remaining tablespoon of butter into 4 slices and top each potato with one.

When the love story hits the movies, the library assistant winds up with the football star. The shy guy wins the homecoming queen. Real life partners, however, demonstrate again and again that it’s similarity that leads to attraction. Matthew D. Johnson, Chair and Professor of Psychology at Binghamton University, State University of New York, says we’re not looking for opposites. He points to years of studies where social scientists have been looking at a variety of desirable characteristics: attitudes, personality, outside interests and values.
Those researchers have found no evidence that differences in these traits or others — education, politics, upbringing, religion — lead to greater attraction. Similarity wins out by a wide margin in the hunt for a romantic partner.
Psychologists Matthew Montoya and Robert Horton in 2013 drew on more than 240 studies conducted since the 1950s. They found clear and convincing evidence that similarity is associated with attraction. Even in widely differing cultures, people chose similar, rather than opposite, partners.
When college students were given written bios of potential mates, they preferred the ones whose descriptions matched their own or their ideal self. Partners who were seen as complementary lost out. Introverts didn’t go out of their way to pick extroverts, for example.
But the myth of opposites attracting continues to fly in the face of all the scientific evidence, says Johnson, who is also Director of the Marriage and Family Studies Laboratory at Binghamton. Why do romantics cling to this scientifically disproven notion?
For one thing, it’s contrasts that stand out. We all know couples who are as alike as peas in a pod but who wind up in arguments about their differences, even if those differences are slight. For another, scientists have demonstrated that couples in committed relationships can ease into complementary patterns of behavior over time. For example, he becomes known as the funny one, and she takes on the role as the serious one. Differences that were small at the beginning of the romance can loom larger with the passing of years. Similar partners become more complementary over time.
The research evidence doesn’t mean that opposites can’t attract. It just shows that our attraction to similarities plays a much larger role in romance.

Susan Sarandon appeared to refer to making the 1998 movie “Twilight” when she told BBC Radio 5 she discovered she was earning less than Paul Newman and co-star Gene Hackman. The movie makers used “favored nations”—a negotiation term that guarantees each actor in a film receives the same pay as their co-stars— but then applied it only to the two men in the film, according to Sarandon.
"They said it was ‘favored nations,’ but they only meant the two guys. He (Newman) stepped forward and said, ‘Well, I’ll give you part of mine.’ So, yeah, he was a gem,” said Sarandon of Newman. Making up the difference meant a reduced salary for Newman.
Sarandon mentioned Newman’s offer to BBC Radio 5 Live when she reflected on a recent similar gesture. “Emma Stone once came forward and said she got equal pay because her male stars insisted upon it and gave up something of theirs,” she said. “That happened to me with Paul Newman at one point, when I did a film with him ages ago." The neo-noir thriller Twilight also starred Reese Witherspoon.
Newman died aged 83 in 2008.
Sarandon’s recounting seems especially meaningful in a week when the standing of women took the limelight at Academy Awards. Best Actress winner McDormand gave a high-profile plug to a term that embraces a legal effort to push for greater on-screen diversity that would affect women.
McDonald ended her rousing acceptance speech during the Oscar broadcast on Sunday by saying, “I have two words to leave with you tonight, ladies and gentlemen: inclusion rider.” The idea is that A-list actors can stipulate in their contracts benchmarks in hiring for both onscreen and below-the-line jobs should reflect women, people of color and members of the LGBT community.
Sarandon also touched on another sensitive topic impacting women in her BBC 5 interview. The actress, 71, also said she believes the Hollywood a casting couch is not going to disappear.
“I think what will go away is the unwanted exchange, but I think that giving yourself sexually, or being drawn to power and wanting to have sex with someone that's in power is also a choice, said Sarandon in the BBC 5 interview. “What we don't want to have is being exploited and to have the Harvey Weinsteins of the world holding it over your head and holding it over your project - that is the most despicable.”

But today is a good time to recognize that tomorrow will take away some of youth’s benefits. Take your strong, healthy heart, for instance. The risk of major problems that lead to heart trouble — high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes —climb dramatically around the age of 40. Stop these six bad habits now, and you’ll enjoy a healthy heart for years to come.
<strong>Smoking</strong>
Most smokers who manage to quit meet with failure between seven and 10 times before they succeed. Knowing that failure is a normal part of the process will keep you going, and persistence pays off. Dodging the smoking habit will save you from a major cause of heart disease. Enlist your doctor’s help in making a plan that you can stick with.
<strong>Eating the Bad Stuff</strong>
Being overweight can lead to heart disease. A better diet will help keep your waistline trim as your metabolism starts slowing around the age of 40. Good eating habits are a good idea at any age, and they grow more important as you grow older. Try to keep your weight within a 15-pound range of the weight your doctor recommends.
“Your metabolism is slowing, so if you're doing what you've always done, you may start gaining weight,” says Dr. Deepak Bhatt. He is the executive director of interventional cardiovascular programs at Brigham and Women's Hospital Heart and Vascular Center. Dr. Bhatt is also a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
<strong>Piling Food on Your Plate</strong>
Portion control is important in preventing weight gain that can threaten your heart health. Visualizing portions that are the right size can help you get a handle on potion control. Nutritionists recommend limiting a serving of protein to the size of a fist, grains to a tennis ball and greens to a baseball. Limit butter to a single teaspoon per portion, olive oil to one teaspoon and nut butter to two teaspoons.
Listen to your body when you eat. If you’re still hungry after eating these portions for a normal-sized meal, wait before you dig in again. If you’re still hungry after a short break, switch to low-calories foods such as fruit and vegetables.
<strong>Exercising Too Little (or Too Much)</strong>
Your heart will grow stronger if you make regular exercise a habit throughout your life. Aim for 30 to 45 minutes a day, three to four days each week. But too much exercise can do damage just as much as too little. Research shows that super-intense workouts such as CrossFit, SoulCycle, or Barry's Bootcamp may damage the heart, especially later in life. Heavy exercise can also make underlying heart issues worse.
Start recognizing in your 20s that you’ll need a little time to warm up as you grow older. After 40, plan on a 5-minute to 10-minute warm-up and cool down after intense exercise.
<strong>Letting Stress Take Over</strong>
Stress is a part of life you can’t avoid, but how you respond to stress can make a big difference in your heart health. Lacking control over de-stressing is what can damage your heart in the long run. Look for ways such as meditation to decompress and react to stress in healthier ways.
<strong>Retreating from Friends</strong>
Research is finding that loneliness and social isolation rank right up there with smoking for putting your heart at risk. One study says cutting yourself off from friends can increase your risk of heart disease by 29 percent. Some experts think that getting together with friends and family may play a major role in reducing stress.

Fear of negotiating, fear of employers perceiving them as too aggressive, fear of seeking compensation for their time and expertise as well as their work. Barbara Stanny confronted these fears in her book <em>Secrets of Six-Figure Women</em>.  Now writer Kristin Wong revisits Stanny’s groundbreaking work, and finds that, “Often enough, the only things standing in the way of financial progress are our own limiting beliefs about money.” Are these roadblocks holding you back financially?
<strong>Tolerating low pay</strong>
Whereas “high earners make darn sure they’re well compensated for their time and work,” Stanny writes, “it rarely dawns on (or appeals to) an underearner to set her sights on a higher salary.” Earning less tends to lead women to expect less, so they don’t ask for a higher salary, according to Stanny. Underearners are 'so tolerant of earning less that they don’t even consider money as part of the equation.'
Women may be susceptible to tolerating low pay because they are “socialized to be in support roles,” says Alice Stuhlmacher, a psychologist and researcher at DePaul University. Women know that employers view assertiveness in women negatively, and that knowledge bolters women’s willingness to accept low pay.
<strong>Underestimating Their Value  </strong>
Stanny says women underestimate the value of their work. That suggestion is backed up by a 2012 study published in <em>Basic and Applied Social Psychology</em> that demonstrated a tendency for women to devalue themselves based on their societal role. Psychologists call this the “depressed entitlement effect,” Women in the study paid themselves less than men for the same work. They measure the value of their work against knowing that they receive lower pay than men.
Employers are the one who can alter this dynamic, although women can speak up for change. “Transparency about opportunities removes obstacles for women’s pay,” Stuhlmacher says. “It normalizes asking for resources and reduces backlash for assertive behavior.”
<strong>Giving It Away for Free</strong>
Stanny suggests that women continue to give away their work for free long after their unpaid internships earn them a foot in the door of the workplace. “Underearners regularly give away their time, knowledge, and skills for nothing,” Stanny writes. “They’ll work at no charge without thinking twice. Most of the time, it’s so ingrained they aren’t even conscious they’re doing it.”
High earners expect compensation not only for their work but also for their time and expertise. Whether it’s overtime or speaking at an event, they expect to be paid.
<strong>Failing to Negotiate</strong>
Women know they face a social penalty when they try to negotiate, and so they tend to avoid negotiation altogether. People tend to associate negotiation with masculine characteristics like confidence, dominance, and assertiveness,” Stuhlmacher says. “But when women act in these assertive ways, they might be disliked and face backlash because this behavior does not fit societal expectations for women.”
Stanny writes, “underearners are reluctant to ask for more. Underearners hold back simply because they’re too scared.” But, negotiating is necessary. “It’s hard for most women in all income brackets to demand more. High earners might not like it (and they rarely do), but they do it,” Stanny writes. “That’s how these six-figure women got where they are. They do what they are afraid to do.”

Now you’re heading for the altar, and the sticky question comes up: should you invite him to the wedding? The answer is yes, and no. You’ll want to consider the feelings of your future husband. Would you be receptive if the tables were turned and he wanted to have his high school sweetheart in attendance on your special day? Your motives play an important part in making the decision. Are they respectful, kind and considerate of everybody? Here are some things you’ll want to think about as you draw up your wedding guest list.
<strong>Is the ex a part of your life now?</strong>
Rachel Sussman, a marriage and relationship therapist in New York, said a good test for deciding whether an ex should be invited is whether that person has been part of the life of that couple.
“If someone all of a sudden says, ‘I want to invite this person to my wedding,’ and the fiancé hasn’t met him or her, that’s weird to me.” Chances are excellent that your fiancé also would find unsettling your desire to issue such an invitation out of the blue.
<strong>Most of us aren’t marrying our very first love.</strong>
Many people are marrying later in life when they’ve established careers and feel financially secure. Online dating has expanded social circles and made it easier to find new people to date. You may have a long list of past relationships or even hookups who may expect to be included in the festivities.
“We don’t live in a world where people marry their first kisses,” said Diane Gottsman, a San Antonio etiquette expert. “Lots of people date lots of people these days. We might have dated people at one time or another and now they are our neighbors, our dentists, our friends.”
She adds, “There really aren’t any definites. It is subjective based on the feeling of the couple and the circumstance.”
<strong>Is jealousy raising its ugly head?</strong>
You want to be careful of your intended’s feelings, but you may want to take a look at his motives if he wants to leave your old boyfriend out of the festivities.
“Are you all friends now and the bride or groom is just jealous? If that’s the case, that is a sign of bigger problems to come,” said Ms. Gottsman. “That person is going to be jealous of co-workers and family members down the line. If you’re making a declaration that this is a fresh start for us, we are keeping it limited to close family and friends, that is different.”
Often you and your fiancé and your ex are part of a close-knit circle of friends. You’ve hung out for years with the crowd, and old romantic flames have died and lain dormant so there’s no jealousy. Then the question of inviting isn’t tricky. But just as often, the choice can carry emotional baggage. Think about how you’ll be feeling if the old boyfriend watches as you walk out of his life forever.

This time the Oscar goes to <em>Moonlight</em> as the pair makes the first award of the night to the Best Picture winner of 2017. The presentation was overshadowed last year by an infamous mix-up that saw the <em>Bonnie and Clyde</em> couple almost send the gold statuette home with <em>La La Land</em>.
It’s the Academy’s bid to give the cast of Moonlight a moment to truly bask in the glory of their win, according to <em>US Weekly</em>.
A stunned audience of Hollywood A-listers saw <em>La La Land</em> producer Jordan Horowitz interrupt his acceptance speech to explain, “There’s a mistake. <em>Moonlight</em>, you guys won Best Picture.”
The unscripted drama unfolded when Beatty was given the envelope and then hesitated for a long moment before handing it with an air of confusion to Dunaway. Dunaway announced <em>La La Land</em> as the winner. Later, the actress told NBC Nightly News, “I was very guilty, I could have done something surely. Why didn’t I see Emma Stone’s name on the top of the card?”
Beatty told the Academy Awards audience at the time: “I opened the envelope and it said Emma Stone, <em>La La Land</em>. That’s why I took such a long look at Faye and at you. I wasn’t trying to be funny.” Stone had just won Best Actress in the category before Best Picture.
<em>Moonlight</em> director Barry Jenkins and the movie’s cast and producers accepted the award after La La Land director Damien Chazelle left the stage.
Two PricewaterhouseCoopers partners who were responsible for handing the winners’ envelopes to the presenters failed to give the correct envelope to Beatty and Dunaway. The PwC pair won’t be returning to tonight’s show.

Upbeat music makes you want to exercise longer and stick with a daily exercise program, researchers said. They reached that conclusion after putting 127 people to an electrocardiogram (ECG) treadmill stress test. Study participants who listened to up-tempo tunes through headphones ran past those who had no music for motivation. The beat kept them going for almost one whole minute longer than those who didn't have tunes playing in their ears.
“At least on a small scale, this study provides some evidence that music may help serve as an extra tool to help motivate someone to exercise more, which is critical to heart health,” said study leader Dr. Waseem Shami. 'I think it's something we intuitively knew, but we found to be true.”
The treadmill stress test is widely used to measure the effects of exercise on the heart. Earlier studies have examined how music might affect specific markers of heart health. The latest research by Texas Tech University researchers is the first to evaluate the impact of music on exercise tolerance during cardiac stress testing.
Participants were asked to run for as long as they could during a test that can be very tough. The treadmill’s speed and incline are increased every three minutes during a cardiac stress test. After six minutes, runners feel as though they’re running up a mountain, said Shami. Adding 50 seconds to enduring the test means a lot. Shami, a cardiology fellow at Texas Tech, said even a small increase in exercise time can have a huge impact on heart health.
Shami said most healthy people usually last for seven to eight minutes. The runners in the study pushed their endurance to eight and a half minutes on average if they were listening to music. They outlasted those who had no music by- 51 seconds or more than 10 per cent longer. Those results led researchers to suggest doctors should consider prescribing music when they encourage patients to exercise more.
He told Cardiology Today his inspiration to conduct the experiment came when he was out for a run and he lost music when the battery on his phone died. “There was no more music and I really didn’t feel like running anymore,” he said. “I thought that was strange. I had the ability to run the same amount that I always run, and then suddenly without the music, I didn’t want to run anymore.
Researchers will present their results at the American College of Cardiology's 67th Annual Scientific Session in Florida this month. The average age of participants in the study is 53.

You’re born with some traits such as good looks or—gasp!—the right smell. These are characteristics you can revise to some degree. Think cosmetics or perfume. Other traits that signal attractiveness can be even easier to change. Making yourself more attractive doesn’t necessarily require running to the makeup counter or splurging on the latest fashion.
Attractiveness is the sum of many different traits, both physical and personality. Appearances do count in this day of “swipe right, switch left.” Research says we seem a lot less attractive when we aren’t getting enough sleep. One study found the sleep-deprived appeared not only less attractive but also less healthy and sadder. Looking mean or too proud can be turnoffs. Showing contractive body language such as crossing arms or hunching shoulders can make you less attractive.
Stress can make you unattractive. Women with high levels of the stress hormone cortisol were perceived by heterosexual men as less attractive in one recent study. Researchers say that's possibly because lower stress and lower cortisol levels indicate health and fertility.
And it’s not just appearances that matter. Personality and character count. A study asked participants to rate photos of potential mates on whether they looked either intelligent or unintelligent, dependent or independent, and honest or dishonest. The only trait out of the three that participants judged as having a substantial effect on attractiveness and liking turned out to be honesty.
Even smell comes into play. Researchers have found that the more similar their smell, the less attracted the participants were to their partners. At the same time, however, studies have also found that we avoid partners who smell too different from us.
Science seems to have narrowed the most universally attractive personality traits down to four, and luck is on our side. These are four trails that we can all improve with some honest effort.
<strong>Positive Attitude</strong>
You can learn to be a positive thinker, and the rewards will carry over to other aspects of your life in addition to romance. Those who are more optimistic tend to be healthier both physically and mentally. They are more successful at work, and they even tend to live longer lives.
<strong>Balanced Extroversion</strong>
Psychologist Adrian Furnham, PhD, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sideways-view/201504/the-attractiveness-personality-traits" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sideways-view/201504/the-attractiveness-personality-traits', 'for Psychology Today');" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for <em>Psychology Today</em></a> says extroverts who are outgoing and easily conversational enjoy "big social networks, a history of good relationships, an inclination to explore opportunities, and dis-positional happiness." They are also more likely to find generally more “mating success” with more sexual partners and more offspring.
<strong>Confidence</strong>
Confidence is a very attractive personality trait. Potential partners say self-assured people are more authentic as well socially magnetic, according to one to an Arizona State University <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227715591_Age_and_Gender_Differences_in_Mate_Selection_Criteria_for_Various_Involvement_Levels" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227715591_Age_and_Gender_Differences_in_Mate_Selection_Criteria_for_Various_Involvement_Levels', 'study');" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a>.
<strong>Sense of Humor</strong>
A sense of humor ranks among the top five qualities people look for in a partner.

Yet, almost all of us have had at least one breakup in our lives - celebrities included. And just like us, celebrities handle their breakups differently. Check out how our favorite celebrities handled their breakups starting with...
Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore: Kutcher, whose now married to Mila Kunis admitted that it was really tough for him after his divorce from Demi Moore. To deal with his heartbreak, he retreated to Big Sky in Montana where he didn't eat for 7 days. He spent that time reflecting and writing letters to every woman he'd been with who he felt there was still some grudge about it.
Taylor Swift: Although no stranger to breakups, Swift's breakup from Joe Jonas was particularly interesting. The singer went on Ellen DeGeneres show to share how her breakup from Jonas was the fastest breakup in history. She said he broke up from her on like a 27 second phone call.
Arianna Grande: She shared the most devastating breakup she'd ever had was over a text message. The singer said what made it worst was that it was right before she was about to go on stage to perform. Grande remained hushed about who the person was, but folks speculate that it was YouTube star, Jai Brook.
Jordan Sparks: The singer was obviously devastated after her breakup from ex Jason Derulo. They'd been together for 3 years when he decided to just disappear on her after a spat.

Nobody wants to drag into the kitchen after an exhausting session at the gym, but you need to refuel. Complex carbs and protein are required to give you quick muscle recovery. Sports nutritionists say that speed is key in refueling.  A new study recommends eating within about 30 minutes of your workout. Make meal prep fast and easy with a breakfast, lunch or dinner that needs only four ingredients.
<strong>Post-Workout Dinner: Bolognese Pasta</strong>
Start with lean beef for protein and zinc, which boosts protein synthesis. Add pasta for carbs, tomato sauce for fiber and Parmesan cheese for flavor. Cook pasta to package directions. Cook lean ground beef until browned In a separate pan, add a can of premade tomato sauce and heat the mixture until warm. Serve Bolognese sauce over pasta and sprinkle with Parmesan to taste.
<strong>Post-Workout Lunch: Nutter-Nana Sandwich</strong>
No stove, no problem. This no-cook lunch restores protein, increases fiber and adds antioxidants. Spread 3 tablespoons chunky almond butter or peanut butter on two slices of whole-wheat bread. Top one side with sliced bananas and apple. Add a hint of sweetness if you prefer by drizzling some honey or sprinkling on cinnamon Top with the other slice of bread.
<strong> Post-Workout Breakfast: Sunny Banana Oatmeal</strong>
Winter mornings are the perfect time for this hot breakfast. Boost protein even further by substituting sunflower seed butter for almond butter. Choose regular or quick-cooking oatmeal instead of instant. Instant presweetened oatmeal can conceal a lot of extra sugar. Cook quick oats on the stove with 1/2 cup to 1 cup milk. Then top with one sliced banana and 1 heaping tablespoon sunflower butter. Add vanilla extract, cinnamon, fresh berries, or toasted nuts for added crunch and flavor.
<strong>Post-Workout Snack: PB&amp;J Smoothie</strong>
This smoothie isn’t just a reminder of your favorite childhood after-school treat. The Concord grape juice helps refuel the body for recovery and also contains a type of antioxidant— polyphenol— that is good for heart health. Add one scoop protein powder, 1/4 cup grape juice, 1 tablespoon peanut butter, and 1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk in a blender. Add ice to make this smoothie thicker. Add some frozen berries or sweetened almond milk to make the drink sweeter.

There’s no need for pricey spas or fad retreats when you take advantage of the body’s natural mechanisms to move toxins out of your system. Use these easy steps to rev up your metabolism. You’ll improve your overall health and speed recuperation from those bad habits left over from a long, dark winter of inactivity and poor diet.
<strong>Start with Water</strong>
Drink a tall glass of water in the morning. Add juice from half of a lemon to your water to promote digestion. Good digestion moves waste out of the body, and lemon also helps hydrate your system.
<strong>Add a Lot of Tea</strong>
Tea hydrates you, especially if you’re drinking herbal tea. Tea also fills you up so that you are not so prone to overeating or eating the wrong things. If you worry about the caffeine in tea, keep in mind that it’s gentler on your digestive system that the caffeine you find in coffee. The caffeine in tea will energize you without making you as jittery as coffee would. In addition to these benefits, tea also is loaded with antioxidants.
<strong>Exfoliate Your Skin</strong>
This tip may come as a surprise. Skin is part of your body’s network of dead epidermal cells --hair, fingernails and toenails -- that helps slough off cellular waste material. Sweat glands in the skin also play active roles in the excretory system of organs and glands that flush out toxins and excess minerals from the body. The body does an excellent job of sloughing off skin cells through normal activity, but regular bathing helps a lot. For an added boost, skin brushing and oil massages help exfoliate the toxins from your skin and refresh circulation.
<strong>Get Your Body Moving</strong>
People who exercise regularly have far fewer total toxins in their systems than the average couch potatoes. Exercise encourages digestion as well as circulation in the blood and lymph system. In addition to speeding the removal of toxins, exercise provides the extra benefits of strengthening your body, lubricating joints and reducing tension.
<strong>Fight Back Against Environmental Pollutants</strong>
Fight pollution and allergens in the air that can trigger allergies and leave you with puffy red eyes. Flushing your nasal passages regularly with a Neti Pot can enhance your breathing naturally. When used before bed, the Neti Pot can help you sleep better.
<strong>Sweat It Out in a Sauna</strong>
Sweating is another way that skin helps remove waste from the body, but it's not as effective as sauna lovers might think. The chief role of sweat cooling us off when exercise or high temperatures cause our internal mercury to rise. Some experts say the detoxifying benefits of sweat are negligible and simply a side effect of this cooling process. Sauna lovers who disagree say nothing beats a good sweat for a great detox.
<strong>Cut Back on Sugar </strong>
Reduce the amount of sugar, honey, molasses and artificial sweeteners that you eat. The more sweeteners you consume, the more you are asking your body to produce insulin. The resulting strain on your pancreas ultimately leads to chronic fatigue and wears you out. You may develop diabetes or cancer, and you’re almost certain to add on extra pounds.
<strong>Eat Whole Plant Foods</strong>
Processed foods lack the nutrients your body needs, while whole plant foods such as dark green vegetables are located with micronutrients. Develop a varied diet that concentrates on colorful veggies and fruits along with whole grains, beans and legumes and small amounts of nuts and seeds.

Get ready to test out your most flattering lookalike hopes by heading over to PopSugar’s new celebrity twinning app at #Twinning. Find your match among Hollywood actresses, punk rock stars and old-school politicians. The new app shares Google’s Arts and Culture Face Match aim to reveal your twin. Instead of searching among the world’s great paintings, however, @Twinning delves into a database of celeb images to connect with your famous pop culture doppelganger.
Use the tool to take a selfie or upload your own photo. You’ll receive five matches and a “twinning percentage” for your top lookalikes.
The results can be hysterically funny and off target. Vary the angles and hairstyles, and you can get dramatically different matches. Makeup and lighting will also provide a wide array of results.  Hair color seems to make a big impact in the app’s selection. Hide your dark hair under a wig, and your twin might go from Katharine Hepburn to Brigitte Bardot.
And the #Twinning app seems inclined to tell women that they look like guys. The app delivered noticeably more male matches than Google’s Arts and Culture Face Match when I experimented. Maybe I was having a bad makeup day when I tried it out. I’ve always thought that Axl Rose of Guns N' Roses is one of the prettiest hard rockers, no problem. But c’mon. Gary Oldman? I take comfort in the tool twinning me with Pink and Christina Applegate. But Donald Trump? Jeff Bridges?
<em>The New York Times</em> recently ran a story that said artificial intelligence software is only as smart as the data that trains it. The story quoted a study that said one widely-used facial recognition data set was estimated to be more than 75 percent male and more than 80 percent white. So that tidbit may explain the number of grizzled men who resemble me.  I’m feeling better since reading the <em>Times</em> about the male twins that PopSugar handed me.
By this week almost 50,000 people had tried out the #twinning database. Join them, and you may not find the software agrees you’re a ringer for Gigi Hadid. But your vanity may be tickled to discover #Twinning thinks you look just like a noted French actress, film director and screenwriter. Hats off to Nicole Garcia. I’m flattered! Just like Google’s Arts and Culture Face Match, this is one addictive app. Maybe I’ll keep going back until I match up with Lady Bird’s Greta Gerwig.

Researchers say the study brings us closer to recognizing how diet contributes to cancer risk, and its findings indicate inflammation may play an important role. "With this study, we are inching closer to understanding inflammation as a cancer risk," said lead study author Fred Tabung, a research associate in the department of nutrition at Harvard. "There are several stimulators of chronic inflammation, and diet is one of those factors that can constantly stimulate the body toward a more chronic inflammatory state."
Researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health followed 121,050 adults over a period of 26 years and categorized participants based on the degree their diets promoted inflammation. Those with the most inflammatory diets ate a lot of processed meats, red meat, organ meat, sugary beverages and refined grains. Their diets included very few vegetables, coffee, tea or wine.
The study found 2,700 newly diagnosed colon and rectal cancer cases within the very pro-inflammatory group during that 26-year span.
Women and men who ate a very inflammatory diet were found to be 32 percent more likely to develop colorectal cancer than those who ate healthier foods, researchers say. Women eating the most inflammatory diets had a significantly higher risk of developing cancer— 22 percent — relative to women eating the least inflammatory diets. The relative risk increase for men was even higher for men at 44 percent.
Marji McCullough, a nutrition epidemiologist with the American Cancer Society. encourages us to look at the big picture. “While it’s tempting to focus on specific foods, how overall diet contributes to this inflammatory effect is likely more important than individual foods because foods may act together in influencing disease risk,” she said.
She recommends including whole grains in the diet to add bulk and said whole grains may dilute carcinogens. McCullough also recommends cutting the amount of red meat and processed meat in your diet. The WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer has previously identified processed meats as increasing the risk of colorectal cancer, and the agency said red meat probably does the same.
McCullough pointed out that the current study captured only some of the foods likely to influence inflammation. A good anti-inflammatory diet—such as the Mediterranean Diet— includes lots of fruits and vegetables, lean meat and fish and whole grains.
Getting anti-inflammatory nutrients from whole foods is probably the best idea, but supplements can help with chronic inflammation. Studies have found six supplements reduce inflammation: Alpha-Lipoic Acid, Curcumin, Fish Oil, Ginger, Resveratrol, and Spirulina. Check with your doctor before taking supplements if you have a medical condition or take medication. Make sure you follow the correct dosage.

His bid was meaningful because he focused on details in their unique courtship that were especially significant to his true love. The pair shared an intimate joke that they would delay a wedding until their ducks were in a row. So he lined up 10 inflatable ducks in a line. Walking with his girlfriend to each one, he related a memory of their romance. The walk ended when he fell to one knee.
His proposal wasn’t public or hugely expensive. He didn’t rent a jumbotron at their homecoming football game to proclaim his love. But he was super creative, and the moment spoke volumes to her. These are the elements that smart boyfriends should keep in mind when they think about proposing on Valentine’s Day.
Proposers shouldn’t rely on spending a lot of money to make their bid significant. Fireworks, fine wine and out-of-season exotic flowers may not mean as much as reminiscing about a special shared moment. Did you dance on the beach at sunrise to a tune that became your song? Did you both realize you’d found The One laughing at the wrong moments during a bad movie? Was your first date on the third Wednesday of the month? Then incorporate those great memories in the proposal. Take her to the beach and play the song or stream the same bad movie or plan a date for third Wednesday of the month.
The thoughtful plan will speak much more directly to her heart than the most expensive candlelit dinner in a super fancy restaurant that’s offering a discount on Valentine’s Day. Statistics say that Valentine’s Day is a favorite of proposers. But if the date is not particularly significant in your courtship, you may want to pick another. Anniversaries of first dates, first kisses, or first getaways can mean more when starting a memorable engagement.
That doesn’t mean you have to rule out a lovely dinner at your favorite shared restaurant. You probably, however, want to rethink the movie cliché of hiding a diamond ring in the chocolate soufflé. The same goes for rose petals, candles and other romantic décor. Think of a location that’s special. Could any proposal be more romantic than the example of Prince Harry, who sprang the question on Meghan Markle as they roasted a chicken during a cozy evening at home?
You may want to skip using the proposal plan that’s trending all over Snapchat. If hiking the trails of Colorado played a part in your vacations, pulling out a ring on top of a mountain and snapping a selfie of the two of you with mountains in the background may seem like a natural extension of your courtship. But if you never made it off the couch at the ski resort, take the picture by the lodge fireplace. Make the proposal a genuine reflection of your special moments together instead of a contrived post.

Once we feel comfortable that we’ve got enough money to be stable, piling up more is no guarantee of happiness. That’s because real happiness is a journey, not a destination, according to Sherry Benton, Ph.D. Benton has more than 25 years of experience in counseling psychology. Family and friends and social connections increase our happiness. Experiencing new activities and showing compassion for others make us forget about ourselves. Here are 10 choices you can make for happiness right now.
<strong>Value experience over buying.</strong>
Try to do something new or go somewhere new instead of buying new stuff. Take in a concert or go to the theater. Get outside and walk in the park. Go on a vacation to some place you’ve always wanted to explore.
<strong>Focus on what’s good. </strong>Put on paper your thoughts about what’s right in your life. Writing a daily gratitude list is a good way to turn off negative thinking. The exercise will help you stop worrying and feel more satisfied.
<strong>Connect with your community. </strong>
Spend time with family and friends. They are the core of your support network. Make an effort to expand your group of friends and cultivate an active social life. Connecting to your community will help you do better and feel better about your life<strong>.</strong>
<strong>Help others</strong>.
Making another person’s life happier ultimately will make your own life happier. Whether your act of kindness hits close to home such as helping out a friend or family member or whether your compassion extends to volunteering at a soup kitchen doesn’t matter. Showing that you care about others is what counts.
<strong>Stop judging. </strong>
Scientists say happiness relates to the brain’s release of dopamine, which carries signals between your brain cells. Giving in to critical and judgmental thinking shuts down the dopamine system. The result is that you feel even more dissatisfied and unhappy.
<strong>Get regular exercise outdoors.</strong>
Working out in fresh air will make you feel even better than going to the gym. Add hiking or biking to your regular activities.
<strong>Get absorbed in an activity.</strong>
Find an activity so absorbing that you totally focus on the experience and forget to think about yourself. Knitting or cooking, writing or painting, playing music, fishing or sailing. These are the kinds of activities that will make you forget about your ego.
<strong>Enjoy your work</strong>.
Find a career that you genuinely enjoy.  Target work that uses your strengths and offers you opportunities for success.
<strong>Get some sleep</strong>. Seven to eight hours sleep every night will make an enormous difference in the way you feel. Enough sleep will boost your happiness, energy and enthusiasm during the day.
<strong>Practice meditation. </strong>
You’ll reduce your blood pressure and pain levels if you meditate for just 10 minutes each day. Mediating also will help reduce your depression and anxiety.

Somebody messed up and landed the officially designated most romantic day of the year right smack in that part of the calendar when the weather is lousy. Historians say we link Valentine’s Day to romance because in medieval times folks believed birds chose their mates on February 14<sup>th</sup>. Human lovebirds in the Middle Ages seized on the idea and recited poetry to their beloveds in honor of the day. Go ahead with the recitation if that’s to your taste but add some more indoor V-Day activities that will keep you out of the cold and heat up your romance.
<strong>Go stargazing.</strong>
You probably won’t be spreading out a blanket on the grass to gaze upward at the stars when temps are plummeting downward, so head to the nearest planetarium for a romantic viewing of the night sky. You’ll be comfy, and you’ll find the seating is cozier than the cold, hard ground.
<strong>Picnic in front of the fire.</strong>
When it's too cold for a picnic outside, throw a log on the fire or get the Netflix Fireplace for Your Home on your TV. Load up a picnic basket with oysters and Champagne and enjoy the mood and yummies with your loved one. No ants will threaten you good times.
<strong>Pamper with a spa night.</strong>
Let him paint your toes for an at-home mani/pedi after you give him a facial. Then reverse roles. You’ll both end up with glowing skin and a pampered feeling. Spa night calls for a massage for both of you, and that’s a fine idea for a Valentine’s date.
<strong>Satisfy your sweet tooth.</strong>
Head for the kitchen and whip up your favorite dessert to sweeten the mood. Something as simple as strawberries dipped in chocolate or as decadent as Devil’s Food cake would make you very happy, and isn’t that the point of a romantic date? Or go out to a restaurant and order an elaborate pastry you would never try to create at home.
<strong>Turn snow into your playground.</strong>
Take advantage of the winter wonderland if it snows on Feb.14<sup>th</sup>. Stroll through the drifts and leave your footprints in the snow. Go sledding in the park. Have a snowball fight. Build a snowman. Half the fun is snuggling up afterward to get warm.
<strong>Binge on movies and takeout.</strong>
Keep the cuddling going as you try to get through a new Netflix mini-series in one night. Order takeout food and pig out. The first one who falls asleep loses the movie marathon challenge.
<strong>Break out a board game.</strong>
A Valentine’s date can be awkward when the relationship is new and you are both searching for things to talk about. Bring out your favorite board game from childhood. You’ll laugh and bond as hints of uneasiness melt away.

Talk about your boy’s club. Men have dominated the Best Director nominations throughout the history of the Academy Awards. However, critics are crushing on the tale of a 17-year old artistically-inclined girl coming of age in Sacramento, Calif., so who knows? Maybe Gerwig can bring home the Oscar gold this year. Can you name the other four women who received the nod?
<strong>Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker, 2010</strong>
When Bigelow won for her Iraq War thriller, her ex-husband, James Cameron said her movie was "consummately good filmmaking . . . she's outgunned the guys, you know, definitely." Not bad recognition coming from the guy who was nominated the same year for <strong>Avatar</strong>. The guys she outgunned included not only Cameron but also Lee Daniels (<strong>Precious</strong>), Jason Reitman (<strong>Up in the Air</strong>), and Quentin Tarantino (<strong>Inglourious Basterds</strong>), Bigelow was the first woman to win the Oscar for Best Director.
<strong>Sofia Coppola for Lost in Translation, 2004</strong>
Coppola didn’t win Best Director for her acclaimed film, but <strong>Lost in Translation</strong> did take home the Golden Globe for best musical/comedy motion picture. Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray starred in the romantic comedy-drama that Coppola also wrote.
This was the year that Best Picture and Best Director Oscar honors went to <strong>Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</strong> and director Peter Jackson.
<strong>Jane Campion for The Piano, 1994</strong>
Steven Spielberg won his first Best Director award that year for Schindler’s List, beating out Campion’s drama about a mute piano player and her daughter, set in New Zealand during the mid-19th century. The movie did pick up Oscars for Best Original Screenplay, Best Actress (Holly Hunter), and Best Supporting Actress (Anna Paquin).
<strong>Lina Wertmüller for Seven Beauties, 1977</strong>
Wertmüller became the first woman ever nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director. She received her nomination for the Italian language drama she wrote about a World War II everyman who deserts the Italian army during World War II and is captured by the Germans. <strong>Rocky</strong> won Best Director that year for John G. Avildsen and also won Best Picture.
Look at the dates of these nominations and you’ll see that nominations for Best Director for women have been not only few but also far between. Seventeen years elapsed after Wertmüller's recognition before the next nomination for a woman.

That could lead to a higher risk of having babies with neural tube birth defects such as spina bifida and other disabilities. Folic acid also known as vitamin B9 is an essential nutrient. The research emphasizes that getting plenty of dietary folic acid is vital in the development of a baby's spine and skull.  Consulting their health care provider about any special diets is vitally important for pregnant women, the study suggests.
Women on carb-restrictive diets such as Atkins, Paleo or Keto face a risk of babies with these birth defects that’s 30 percent higher than women following other diets, according to the study by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This research is the first to look at the connection between low-carb eating and neural tube defects. Neural tube defects (NTDs) include anencephaly, which is the lethal absence of major portions of the brain and skull. Malformations of the spine and spinal cord are other examples of neural tube defects.
Science had already discovered that a mother’s diet before and during early pregnancy plays a significant role in her baby’s development. News on the higher risk to low-carb moms is concerning because of the popularity of low carbohydrate diets, said research assistant professor Dr. Tania Desrosiers.
The Food and Drug Administration started requiring in 1998 the addition of folic acid to enriched grain products based on the estimation that one-fifth of US women have blood folate concentrations below the level recommended to reduce risk of neural tube defects. But with half of all pregnancies being unplanned, folic acid intake becomes increasingly important for women who may become pregnant. Many pregnant women start taking folic acid only after they learn a neural tube defect may have already occurred.
The journal Birth Defects Research published the study that analyzed data from 11,285 pregnant women from Arkansas, California, Georgia, Iowa, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Texas and Utah. The National Birth Defects Prevention Study took place between 1998 and 2011. Some 9,545 had live born infants without birth defects. But 1,740 of these women had infants, stillbirths or terminations with anencephaly or spina bifida.
The Department of Health recommends a daily supplement of 400 micrograms of folic acid while women are trying to conceive. Moms-to-be should continue taking this dose for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The baby's spine develops during that time.

This is the year you put down the remote and turn off the endless coverage about Tom Brady’s injured throwing hand. Bid the guys farewell and leave them to their riveting Budweiser commercials. Do something you really want to do. Find some like-minded friends and escape the glare of the den’s super-sized big screen. Here’s a reminder of nine alternative things you can do on Super Bowl game day.
<strong>Pamper Yourself.</strong>
treat yourself to a weekend at your favorite spa or gather your friends for an at-home mani/pedi party complete with lotions, nail polish and foot massages. Send out for delicacies from your gourmet shop and indulge.
<strong>Go Out to a Movie.</strong>
Now is the moment to surround yourself with splendid iotation as you enjoy a hard-charging action movie. The usual male audience for <em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em> will be at home in front of a tv during the game, and you’ll find most movie theaters are pretty empty. If your choice of move is a chick flick, you can expect normal attendance. You’ll still have plenty of seats from which to choose.
<strong>Take Tea with Friends</strong>.
Invite your friends over for Darjeeling and scones. Leave the beer and pizza to the guys while you sip fine sherry and nibble cucumber sandwiches and tiny tea cakes. Dress for the occasion. Pearls would be lovely; hat and gloves are not required. Set the sophisticated mood with either classical music or soft jazz.
<strong>Learn to Knit. Or Paint.</strong>
Take a knitting lesson. Go online and find a YouTube tutorial to get started with the basic steps toward becoming a crafty woman. Delight in starting the first of many scarves you’ll churn out and hand out as Christmas presents. Ditto painting class. Set up an easel and discover your inner artist.
<strong>Catch Up on Sleep.</strong>
When was the last time you went to bed early and got a full eight hours sleep? Take a warm bath, leave the phone and tablet in the other room, and climb in for soothing dreams. Fans of the Jaguars and the Vikings may feel free to pull the covers over their heads.
<strong>Dine Out. </strong>
Skip the restaurant with a TV blaring The Game from bar or dining room. Definitely avoid any establishment that bills itself as a sports bar. The rest of the restaurants will be seating few patrons as guys stay home to chow down on Buffalo wings. You’ll have the cozy spot with sophisticated fare all to yourself.
<strong>Go to a Park.</strong>
Take your children along for a hike on local trails or watch them as they swing and slide at the neighborhood playground. Make some family members and bond with the kids. Stop for takeout as you head for home. Fresh air and exercise will send everybody to bed at an early hour.
<strong>Take in an Art Show</strong>
You’ve been promising yourself to catch the latest exhibition at the museum or check out the local artist’s new showing at that downtown gallery. Crowds won’t be lined up three deep to block your view of touring masterpieces. Gaze as long as you wish without feeling you have to rush through. You’ll find plenty of parking on deserted city streets.
<strong>Clean Out the Garage.</strong>
Or the attic, junk drawer or email inbox. You have plenty of empty hours to fill on Super Bowl Day. Even the undisciplined end up with plenty of free time and no excuse to avoid tackling despised chores.

Exactly three hundred dating apps are out there to help you seek romance and explore companionship and courtship. Of all that multitude of dating apps, Sweet Pea stands out with its focus on conversation to help people relate to each other better. Sweet Pea’s signature feature is the "icebreaker" question. Adding a unique and provocative question to profiles makes it easier for users to get a conversation going with a potential match.
Sweet Pea goes live this month after an earlier soft launch. Founder Michael Bruch is the 27-year-old entrepreneur who started Sweet Pea, and he designed the dating app to improve how people communicate with one another.
“I want to help people find healthy, happy relationships and make the world feel like a little bit smaller of a place,” Bruch said. “People are getting worse at just having conversations with strangers. It’s not just a problem with dating apps, it’s social media in general that hasn't done a good job at helping us empathize with strangers. “
Bruch understands that starting a conversation with a stranger can be annoying, awkward, aggravating and even boring. Icebreaker questions counter this challenge. Sweet Pea users create an icebreaker question for their profiles when they sign up. Icebreakers help people find some common interest so that they can start a conversation. Users can upload videos or tag activities. They can tag locations to search for matches.
The entrepreneur says he surveyed about a thousand different people about their experience on dating apps. “I’d ask: ‘How many matches turn into conversation?’ And people would say, “Oh, one in every fifteen.” So I'm trying to solve that with a tangible product and make the app experience feel a little bit better,” he said.
To kick-start the conversation, here are some dating app opening lines:
<ol>
 	<li>Tell me your life story in five emojis.</li>
 	<li>If it was your last day on earth, what would eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner?</li>
 	<li>If someone made a costume of you, what would they wear?</li>
 	<li>On my way to the grocery store—what can I pick up for you?</li>
 	<li>What's your proudest moment?</li>
 	<li>Fill in the blank: I can’t help but laugh when...</li>
 	<li>Tell me about a time you were injured.</li>
 	<li>What’s the most embarrassing song you know all the lyrics to?</li>
 	<li>What's the worst gift you ever got? (And did you return it?)</li>
 	<li>What was your favorite TV show as a kid?</li>
 	<li>What was your favorite birthday?</li>
 	<li>What's the first thing you do when you wake up?</li>
 	<li>Which family member are most similar to?</li>
 	<li>What’s the worst opening line you’ve ever used?</li>
</ol>

Go see which of your favorite celebrities have been matched up. Instagram, Celebs are just like you and me: they’ve taken to Twitter and YouTube users to share photos of themselves and their cultured doppelgangers. Who can blame them? The app is addictive when you’re just searching for yourself.
Take the fun one step further, and you’ll find Alyssa Milano’s succinct and hilarious reaction at being paired up as a likeness of Jan Van Assen. A portrait of the man resides in the Rijksmuseum. Equally miscast is Kate Hudson, who is twinned with Portrait of a Boy hanging in The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.
Other times the Google app comes eerily close to a true match. See Jim Parsons with Russian dude Mikhail Ivanovich, whose portrait hangs in the Malmo Konstmuseum. Kumail Nanjiani as a ringer for Portrait of Mohammed Al Mazrouie in Barjeel Art Foundation collection. Meryl Streep found in Portrait of Baby de Almeida. Spooky.
Here’s how you do it for yourself. Download the Google Arts &amp; Culture app from either <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.cultural" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.cultural', 'Google Play');">Google Play</a> or the <a href="https://www.apple.com/?afid=p231%7Ccamref%3A1011l7vU&amp;cid=AOS-US-AFF-PHG" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.apple.com/?afid=p231%7Ccamref%3A1011l7vU&amp;cid=AOS-US-AFF-PHG', 'iPhone store');">iPhone store</a>. Scroll until you see the "Is your portrait in a museum?" feature. You’ll be prompted to snap a selfie. After receiving your snapshot, the app goes to work searching through its database of thousands of artworks. Within seconds, the app will match your face with paintings that resemble you. You’ll see the two faces side by side.
Once you’ve checked it out a couple of times—full frontal photo and left and right profiles— you can move on to making funny faces.
Don’t forget the app was originally created so users could admire famous artworks at their fingertips. It was the addition of the match feature in mid-December that exploded the app across the Internet.

Sounds tempting, right? You’ll need to pay special attention to nutrition, and you’ll find that you won’t lose weight quickly. But you can see great results with Low-Intensity Sustained State training. LISS is low intensity cardio- and aerobic-based activity performed typically for 30 minutes to 60 minutes. Think about taking a brisk walk or raising the incline on a treadmill. Biking, swimming or surfing are good examples, and so are using the gym’s stair machine, rowing machine or elliptical.
LISS is growing in popularity not just because you can see a leaner shape and lose weight with low effort. It’s perfect for beginners who are just starting out in exercise and fitness. The risk of injury is significantly lower. Newcomers can use LISS to increase strength and endurance before they move on to higher intensity workouts.
Those who are already working at higher intensity levels can use LISS for a day of recovery or active rest. Mixing sprints into your runs can be hard on your joints while it’s burning up calories. You may need more recovery after a high-intensity session. LISS helps regenerate and condition muscles, so it’s excellent to help wind down from high-intensity workouts.
Trainers say using a combination of LISS and HIIT is the most effective way to lose fat. HIIT training effectively breaks up more stubborn, hard-to-burn fat, but is not very good at metabolizing it out. Low-Intensity Sustained State training is great at metabolizing fat but very bad at breaking down stored fat.
What does that mean for someone who prefers to stick with LISS alone? Your body will start to break down its own muscles as a source of fuel instead of going after the triglyceride bonds within more stubborn fat. The result: you get thinner, but you lose strength.
Good nutrition is much more important when you train daily in the LISS style. Make sure you’re eating the right foods, and get enough of them.
Here are some ideas for a Low-Intensity Sustained State workout:
<ul>
 	<li>Walk fast and try some hills — your pace may slow on the incline, but your effort should remain steady.</li>
 	<li>Bike either on mostly flat terrain or a stationary bike at a manageable pace.</li>
 	<li>Test out the elliptical, and work your upper and lower body at the same time. Go both forward and backward.</li>
 	<li>Run at a moderate pace.</li>
 	<li>Dance! Take a Zumba class, try some cardio hip-hop, or experiment with belly dancing.</li>
 	<li>Test out the elliptical, and work your upper and lower body at the same time. Go both forward and backward.</li>
 	<li>Sit down and work out with a rowing machine.</li>
</ul>

This chowder delivers fewer calories and less fat than the usual broccoli cheese soup while providing more than half your daily recommended dose of vitamin C. Make this version your own by substituting mozzarella or Jarlsberg for the Cheddar cheese. Take creativity a step further by using sweet potatoes and Greek yogurt instead of Yukon Gold potatoes and sour cream. Hint: Feel free to use an immersion blender instead of mashing the vegetables.

It’s the time of year between Thanksgiving and Valentine’s Day when more than a third of couples pledge to wed. Many of the loved-up couples will discover to their dismay that money is a perennial source of pre-wedding tension. After the doves have been released and the rose petals strewn, three-quarters of couples will find that they’ve gone over their wedding budget. A quarter of newlyweds who go into debt immediately regret their free-spending celebration, according a survey conducted in Britain.
What entices couples into spending more than they can afford on the happy day? Sociologists say weddings have become more of a symbol of “having arrived” in adult life than a demonstration of a couple’s commitment to a shared future. That leads many to plan a production rivaling a Broadway show.
Adding more fuel to the desire for an Instagram spectacle is the wedding industry.
“The wedding industry has grown substantially throughout the 20th century in part due to the rise of consumerism and industry efforts to commodify love and romance,” according to a study conducted by researchers at Emory University in Atlanta. Their report said bridal magazines market “the necessity of a lavish wedding for a fairy tale marriage.”
The opposite turns out to be true.
Spending more on the wedding ceremony indicates the likelihood of a shorter marriage, said Andrew Francis and Hugo Mialon. The two professors in the Emory Department of Economics surveyed more than 3,000 U.S. newlyweds to find the correlation between length of marriage and wedding spending.
They also linked spending more on an engagement ring to shorter marriages. According to recent surveys, the actual average cost for an engagement ring is over $6,000. Most American couples expect to spend between $1,000 to $5,000 on an engagement ring.
The Emory report found that couples who spend between $10,000 and $20,000 on their wedding are 29 percent more likely than average to get divorced. The risk climbs to 46 percent higher than average when couples spend $20,000 on their wedding. And that doesn’t include the cost of the engagement ring. Spending between $1,000 and $5,000 indicates the couple are 18 percent less likely than average to get divorced. Spend less than $1,000 and the risk of divorce drops to 53 percent less likely than average to divorce.
It’s the bride who is most vulnerable in this scenario of divorce after spending on an expensive wedding. Brides who spent $20,000 or more on their wedding are 3.5 times more likely to end up divorced than brides who spent less than $10,000.
The Emory researchers suggest a huge and costly wedding may indicate the bridge and groom are marrying for the wrong reasons. Marry for the wrong reason and the financial stress that follows a lavish, expensive wedding ultimately wrecks the marriage, the report suggests.
A man is 1.5 times more likely to end up divorced when he chooses a bride for her looks. A woman is 1.6 times more likely to end up divorced when her husband’s wealth is the most important thing to her.

A pregnant woman in Tennessee lost her life to the flu earlier this week. She was the fourth person in the state who died from the virus. The other three Tennessee victims were children. They were among the 13 kids to date who have already died from flu-related illness this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Young children, pregnant women and the elderly who fall ill with the flu are at higher risk for more severe symptoms and complications.
Officials say the first and most important protection against flu viruses is getting a vaccination. Even when the vaccine is only partially effective, it can still lessen the severity of symptoms. CDC officials also recommend getting a flu shot to protect the children and the elderly that you are going to be around.
CDC researchers found that at least three-quarters of children who died from influenza between 2010 and 2014 had not been vaccinated. The family of bodybuilder Kyler Baughman said they do not think he got a flu shot this year. “I just think he ignored it and thought it’d go away like most people,” his mother Beverly told NBC affiliate WPXI. Baughman’s family is urging others to listen to their bodies. “Whenever you have a fever for multiple days, don’t let it go, get it taken care of,” said his father Todd,
It’s not too late to get a shot.
CDC’s flu forecasters say there’s a 60 percent chance that the greatest incidence will hit by late January. Flu season generally peaks near the end of February. The sooner you get vaccinated, the better. Two weeks after vaccination are usually required for antibodies to build up in the body. The CDC recommend a flu shot for children older than 6 months unless there’s a specific reason why they should not take the vaccine, such as an allergy.
Flu symptoms generally come on quickly and can include:
<ul>
 	<li>Fever or feeling feverish/chills</li>
 	<li>Cough</li>
 	<li>Sore throat</li>
 	<li>Runny or stuffy nose</li>
 	<li>Muscle or body aches</li>
 	<li>Headaches</li>
 	<li>Fatigue (tiredness)</li>
 	<li>Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, although this is more common in children than adults.</li>
</ul>
Even if you do not get a flu shot, you can take steps to avoid getting and spreading the virus. The CDC makes these recommendations:
<strong>Avoid close contact.</strong>
Avoid close contact with people who are sick. When you are sick, keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too.
<strong>Stay home when you are sick.</strong>
If possible, stay home from work, school, and errands when you are sick. This will help prevent spreading your illness to others.
<strong>Clean your hands.</strong>
Washing your hands often will help protect you from germs.
<strong>Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.</strong>
Germs are often spread when a person touches a surface or object that is contaminated with germs and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth.
<strong>Clean and disinfect surfaces or objects.</strong>
Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with germs like the flu can help slow the spread of influenza.
Most people who get influenza will recover in several days to less than two weeks, say CDC officials.

The story is embarrassing on so many levels, and serves as a stark reminder that you need passwords that work. Common is not a good characteristic when you’re picking a password to use online. Neither is basic. You want a password that will stump a sophisticated hacker computer.
How do you choose a secure password? Take the advice of internet security provider Norton, and find a password that is long and complicated.
"The shorter and less complex your password is, the quicker it can be for the program to come up with the correct combination of characters,” according to Norton.
“The longer and more complex your password is, the less likely the attacker will use the brute force method, because of the lengthy amount of time it will take for the program to figure it out. Instead, they'll use a method called a dictionary attack, where the program will cycle through a predefined list of common words that are used in passwords.”
If you are not certain that you can come up with a password that’s secure enough, get help from the cyber pros.

This site can also tell you how long would it take a computer to figure out your password. That’s another way to judge just how secure is the password you’ve created.

If you prefer another option to use instead of a password, the University of Southern California have figured out an <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/tech-news/the-secret-to-secure-passwords-poems-11364012430665" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/tech-news/the-secret-to-secure-passwords-poems-11364012430665', 'alternative');"><strong>alternative</strong></a>. Marjan Ghazvininejad and Kevin Knight discovered that we can remember a password using a 60-bit number much easier if it is converted into a sequence of words. They developed a computer program that turns the words into a two-line poem with eight syllables each and ending in a pair of rhyming words.
If you want to create new passwords, here’s some advice that will give you the peace of mind that comes with knowing your choices are secure. Just remember that writing a password is not the best time to declare “iloveyou”.
Use this:
<ul>
 	<li>Use a combination of numbers, symbols, uppercase and lowercase letters</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Ensure that the password is at least eight characters long</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Use abbreviated phrases for passwords</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Change your passwords regularly</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Log out of websites and devices after you have finished using them</li>
</ul>
Avoid this:
<ul>
 	<li>Choose a common password like '123456', 'password', “iloveyou” or '111111'</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Use only one word. Dictionary-based systems let hackers crack passwords</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Use a verson of your name, a family member's name, pet's name, phone number, address or birthday</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Write your password down or share it or let anyone else use your login details</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Answer 'yes' when asked to save your password to a computer browser</li>
</ul>

"It's time to do something about it." Stars such as Reese Witherspoon, Shonda Rhimes, Meryl Streep, and Jennifer Aniston are among those who announced with these words the launch of the Time’s Up movement to end sexual harassment. More than 300 film, TV, and theater celebrities are joining together in the wake of the MeToo movement that followed allegations of sexual misconduct and assault against Harvey Weinstein. The announcement came in a letter to <em>The New York Times</em>
The first symbolic display of the Time’s Up campaign will come Sunday at the Golden Globes. Coalition members are encouraging others in Hollywood to wear black to the awards ceremony. “This is a moment of solidarity, not a fashion moment,” actor Eva Longoria told the <em>New York</em> <em>Times</em>. “For years, we’ve sold these awards shows as women, with our gowns and colors and our beautiful faces and our glamour,” she added. “This time the industry can’t expect us to go up and twirl around. That’s not what this moment is about.”
The coalition encourages women to raise awareness by speaking out against sexual harassment at the event. The Time’s Up coalition includes a legal defense fund, news and resources for everyone from workers on movie sets to A-list stars. In addition to confronting decades of sexual harassment, pay disparity and discrimination in Hollywood, the initiative also promises to help women in all fields who are struggling with the same problems.
“Now, unlike ever before, our access to the media and to important decision makers has the potential of leading to real accountability and consequences,” the <em>New York Times</em> letter said. “We want all survivors of sexual harassment, everywhere, to be heard, to be believed and to know that accountability is possible.”
Here is the Time’s Up plan of action.
<strong>Extend legal aid to survivors of sexual harassment.</strong>
Time’s Up formed a legal defense fund that currently totals $13 million in donations to help working women report sexual harassment or assault.
“Harassment too often persists because perpetrators and employers never face any consequences,” the Times’ Up letter said. “This is often because survivors, particularly those working in low-wage industries, don’t often have the resources to fight back.”
<strong>Increase gender parity.</strong>
Significantly adding to the numbers of women with decision-making authority across all industries with equal pay and opportunity would foster a better work environment. Systemic gender-inequality and imbalance of power fosters an environment that is ripe for abuse and harassment against women, the group said.
The coalition called for “greater representation of women of color, immigrant women, and lesbian, bisexual and transgender women, whose experiences in the workforce are often significantly worse than their white, cisgender, straight peers.”
<strong>Enact legislation that penalizes sexual misconduct.</strong>
The initiative also is writing legislation that penalizes those who commit sexual misconduct. That includes hitting nondisclosure agreements that can be used to silence victims, the group said.

Set goals based on adding a few positive habits to your daily routine. Make just one or two small changes, and you won’t need pricey diet supplements or fancy workouts. Make a habit of these eight back-to-basics behaviors, and you won’t have to worry about willpower. Don’t underestimate the power of small, positive steps. They can take the intimidation out of starting on that lofty New Year’s resolution list. Start with physical activity and sleep. Experts agree these are the two most important elements of good health.
<strong>Put Your Body in Motion Every Day.</strong>
If you can add only one habit to improve your life, improve fitness first. Physical activity has an almost magical ability to improve the quality of your life.  The risk of almost every physical and mental malady is reduced by physical activity.
<strong>Get enough sleep.</strong>
Here’s how essential sleep is to good health. Impaired sleep or insomnia symptoms puts people at significantly higher risk of developing clinical depression. Lack of sleep affects your immune systems, hormones, appetite, weight, thinking, energy, concentration, temper, mood—even life expectancy. The amount of sleep each person requires does vary, but most people need from seven to nine hours.
<strong>Don’t smoke.</strong>
Success is low for smokers who are trying to abandon the habit. About half have tried to quit in the last year. If you are among the 80 percent of smokers who want to quit, use all the available treatment options. Try nicotine patches and medications with a behavioral plan. These aids can increase your chance of quitting five or six times.
<strong>Nurture your relationships.</strong>
Loving attachments and close relationships are the single most important contributors to our happiness. Relationships are important to good health and well-being. Don’t underestimate the importance of nurturing them with spouse, children and friends.
<strong>Eat more fruits and vegetables.</strong>
Fruits don’t provide as many vitamins and minerals as vegetables, but they are a place to start if you aren’t eating much of either. Cook at home with unprocessed foods to add more fruits and vegetables to your diet. Cooking meals at home also lowers your sodium, sugar and calorie intake.
<strong>Get vaccinated. </strong>
The reason cancer, heart disease, diabetes and other chronic conditions lead as today’s causes of death is that people live long enough for these ailments to develop. Only 100 years ago before vaccines curbed infectious diseases, thousands of children never lived to reach adulthood. Even today, thousands of adults die from the flu.
<strong>Get some sun, but don’t overdo. </strong>
Light helps your sleep and mood, while being out in the sun increases your likelihood of physical activity. Sunlight is the only natural way to get vitamin D.  Not getting enough bright light during the day can hinder sleep. Too much sun isn’t good either. Protect yourself from UV rays with sunblock, hats and clothing.
<strong>Eat and drink less sugar. </strong>
Switch that soda or sugary drink to water to lose calories. Decreasing your alcohol intake not only reduces calories but also reduces the risks associated with excess alcohol use. Staying hydrated prevents dehydration effects such as headaches and maintains your energy.

Switch to a breakfast that’s rich in protein, and you won’t snack throughout the rest of the day to satisfy your hunger. Get your daily dose of proteins in the morning with whole foods such as lean meats, eggs and legumes. They’ll curb your appetite longer. Scientists suggest combining between 25 grams and 30 grams of protein with exercise to see weight-loss benefits. “If you find it difficult to control what you eat, a redistribution of protein toward breakfast may be the answer to reducing your waistline without leaving you ravenously hungry and craving unhealthy foods,” said Professor Manny Noakes, co-author of the CSIRO Total Wellbeing Diet. The key to losing weight in a healthy and sustainable way could be a higher protein and moderate carbohydrate breakfast routine.

Soon-to-be brides will look forward to planning nuptials and enjoying bridal showers before the happy day. You should also think about important financial planning during this blissful time. No one plans a wedding while thinking about a divorce, but getting a prenuptial agreement may be an item you’ll want to check off on your to-do list. The conversation may be awkward but necessary, especially if it either of you holds assets such as a business or inherited money or real estate. It may smooth the way if you both realize a prenup lets you, not state laws, decide how you would want to divide property in case of divorce or death of a spouse. Ask yourself these four questions before you walk down the aisle.
<strong>Is Your Future Spouse in Debt?</strong>
Finding out about a potential spouse’s spending habits can save you a lot of grief in the future. An open and honest discussion can save your credit rating. A prenup can keep your spouse’s debt in their name.  Ask if they have outstanding debt, and if they do, ask them how much money they owe. With the protection of a prenup, you won’t be held responsible for your spouse’s future debt if they take out and max out multiple credit cards after the marriage.
<strong>Do You Own a Business?</strong>
A prenup blocks state laws that give your spouse half of the income or assets you’ve made during the marriage. A prenup also prevents state laws that would give your spouse half ownership in your business. You can control the outcome of a divorce if the marriage comes to an end by using a prenup to prevent those state laws from applying.
In the event of a potential divorce, a prenup ensures that you keep your own business interests. That’s important if you own a business going into the marriage or if you start a business after the wedding.
<strong>Are Your Assets Complex?</strong>
Complex assets require more protection. Family businesses and real estate are examples of interests that may need attention. If there are separate things in your name only that you want to protect in the event of divorce, you might want to consider a prenup.
<strong>Are You Moving to a Different State?</strong>
State laws concerning the division of assets in a divorce can differ, and moving across state lines can put assets you never thought would be divided in a divorce at risk. A prenup can protect those assets. Pay special attention if you plan to move after your marriage.
For example, a state such as New York is a 'separate property' state, while a state such as California is a 'community property' state. Recognizing the difference between those state laws highlights the need for a prenup to protect your assets.
