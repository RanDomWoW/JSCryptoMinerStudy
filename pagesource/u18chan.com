U-18Chan Does Not Condone Nazi Ideology by U-18Chan Staff - 18/04/17 @ 23:02PM
</div>
<div class="NewsContent">
In light of recent events I thought it would be worth stating that here at U-18Chan we do not condone Nazi ideology nor is our goal to spread the hatred and prejudice associated. While our name does come from a German U-boat from WWI. As stated in our FAQ section the 'pawstika' seen around the site is the adopted symbol of the Aurorafurries, the group who created this site. U-18Chan is not based on any political or moral basis. Our staff all have their own perspective of these types of things.<br /><br />U-18Chan was born like many *Chan websites from the first English speaking Imageboard 4Chan and has used Kusaba X in the past to run the site. The U-18Chan community came from an older community of the Aurorafurries which came from AuroraChan in 2006.<br /> <br />In early 2006 a community formed around the newly created /fur/ board on AuroraChan of furries drifting over from 4Chan's /b/. The /fur/ board was used to co-ordinate raids on /b/ so fellow furries were drawn to AuroraChan's /fur/ from /b/ raids. As the community on /fur/ grew and developed its own alias, the Aurorafurries, a Xat chat room was created by Serpentor (a moderator on /fur/) to better co-ordinate raids. From here all current U-18Chan administrators met. Although AuroraChan was the base of operations for the Aurorafurries the limitation of a single board and frequent deletions of collections led to the need for a separate website.<br />The first attempt for a separate website failed shortly after its creation so the Aurorafurries turned to Image Board 4 Free, a website that used to allow users to create their own *Chan websites for free off custom ImageBoard software, where an AuroraChan furry Filthy had previously set up a board. Jay, the previous owner of U-18Chan, joined Filthy in creating the new Chan. They named it FilthySlothChan, a portmanteau of their usernames (one of Jay's aliases was AlienSloth Man). The website consisted of four boards: /fur/ - Furries, /c/ - Comics, /s/ - Sexy Beautiful Women, and /lo/ - Lounge; today three of those boards still exist: /fur/, /c/ and /lo/ although they have since been joined by many other boards. With multiple boards for furries compared to AuroraChan's one, users had slowly been moving across to FilthySlothChan so Jay suggested to Filthy that they approach Serpentor about making FilthySlothChan the new new official home of the Aurorafurries. While the IB4F site had been growing in popularity its regular 4Chan raids had on several occasions required it to change it's name (changing the site's name changed its URL) to avoid DDoS attacks from slowing all of IB4F and possibly having their site deleted by IB4F's owner, Infinitus. When the site became the home of the Aurorafurries it was called U-18Chan, as a joke about submarines because the site was hiding from 4Chan retaliative attacks. Sometime after the userbase moved across the /fur/ board on AuroraChan was deleted.<br /> <br />Over time with growing popularity and a dedicated site on IB4F U-18Chan acquired its own domain which it still uses today. Unfortunately, with many other chans on IB4F dodging DDoS attacks and others hosting such dubious content as to warrant police attention, IB4F went down first on Tuesday 7th July 2009 after Bunkerchan brought the site offline for two days then legal problems took it offline for months. After a failed reboot of IB4F, U-18Chan was forced to move to a VPS and a fresh install of Kusaba X instead of the previously used custom IB4F software. Performance issues caused by a high volume of traffic moved U-18Chan to a dedicated machine but with problems persisting and the server reaching the point of crashing permanently Jay contacted Infinitus, who had helped previously, who gave Jay the IB4F software. On July 28th 2011 U-18Chan starting running IB4F which it has been running off since.<br /> <br /><br /><br />

There is a new place to see U18-Chan Bugs and Feature Requests and this thread for requesting changes/fixes to the system.<br />https://u18chan.com/d/topic/1223291<br /><br />Only staff can actually make new tickets on the tracker. All tickets are considered requests/ideas until actually implemented so don't assume that if a ticket is made it will automatically be what will happen. Large changes will likely end up being broken into parts with their discussions in /d at our discretion.

Online~ by U-18Chan Staff - 24/09/12 @ 23:26PM
</div>
<div class="NewsContent">
<h1>Hello fellow furs, we are back online!</h1><br /><br /><h2>What happened?!?</h2><br />Unfortunately due to a "power surge" at our old datacenter our whole server was killed drives and all. I attempted for weeks to work with the company to recover our data off those disks however, they were no help and claimed they were unable to insert the hard drives into another machine so I could rip the data off them. While it is my personal belief that the company is covering up for a screw up on their side we have no way to prove that.<br /><br /><h2>What about all the content?</h2><br />Sadly we did not have any offsite backups available at the time of the incident to restore from BUT~ It looks like most the content is available however, at this point it will be a manual process to re-upload it all. I would like to ask all of you to help us with this huge task of restoring our content. We know this will be a long process but I believe we can do it with some help.<br /><br /><h2>How will this be prevented in the future?</h2><br />We have moved to a new datacenter on hardware we own instead of renting. This way we have full say and control over the server and the drives in it. We are also implementing a 3rd party cloud storage service to be used for offsite backups of our content.<br /><br />Thank you all for your patients and assistance with rebuilding content.<br /><br />-LeonFox

<div class="NewsContent">
<span style="font-size:1.25em"><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></span><br /><hr><br /><br /><ol><br /> <li><b>Does the U-18 in U-18Chan mean under eighteen? Can I post my CP here?</b><br /> <p>No, U-18Chan is actually named after the U boat of the same name from The Great War. Child pornography is not allowed here. You need help, sick bastard.</p><br /> </li><br /> <hr><br /> <li><b>Is this board run by Nazis?</b><br /> <p>No, the 'pawstika' seen around the site is the adopted symbol of the Aurorafurries, the group who created this site. U-18Chan is not based on any political or moral basis. Our staff all have their own perspective of these types of things. </p><br /> </li><br /> <hr><br /> <li><b>Where do I go to sign up?</b><br /> <p>Besides the focus on images, image boards are very well known for their use of anonymity when posting. You do not have to sign up or register. Instead, you simply post with whatever name you choose. You can use tripcodes to help identify yourself if you wish. Currently, there is nowhere to sign up on U-18Chan, so all features may be used by guests and returning visitors alike.</p><br /> </li><br /> <hr><br /> <li><b>What are the 'features' of the site that I keep hearing about?</b><br /> <p>Scroll to the bottom of this page for a list of all our current features or check out the <a href="https://u18chan.com/guide/#features">site guide</a>.</p><br /> </li><br /> <hr><br /> <li><b>I posted [content] on [board] yesterday, but now it's gone! What happened?</b><br /> <p>If the post was made on an inappropriate board, a staff member has most likely moved it to a more appropriate one.</p><br /> </li><br /> <hr><br /> <li><b>I have some images I want to share that do not fit any of the existing categories, where can it go?</b><br /> <p> If something does not fit an existing category, please double check the <a href="https://u18chan.com/guide/#guidelines">image posting guidelines</a> to be sure. If something still does not fit an existing category, please double check the <a href="https://u18chan.com/guide/#guidelines">image posting guidelines</a> as the sections with "anything that isn't covered by another board" should really answer your question.</p><br /> </li><br /> <hr><br /> <li><b>I want to post some lesbian yiff, so that would go in Gay Furries, right?</b><br /> <p>No, but this is an understandable mistake. Please review our <a href="https://u18chan.com/guide/#guidelines">image posting guidelines</a>.</p><br /> </li><br /> <hr><br /> <li><b>Well that is stupid. You should just make Straight Furries and Straight Furry Comics.</b><br /> <p>No, you are stupid. We have not bothered to do this, since we would then have lesbians and gays on the same board even though they do not appeal to each other, and we'd have to move a lot of stuff around. We also fear change.</p><br /> </li><br /> <hr><br /> <li><b>I want to know if anyone has some pics of a specific theme, should I just make an identical request on all boards?</b><br /> <p>No, not if you don't want everyone to hate you forever. If you have a lot of this theme of image, post it in the most appropriate board and ask people to join in. If you have little or no images, or the theme does not fit any of the existing boards, post your request on our Request &amp; Source board. Do not make the same request on multiple boards.</p><br /> </li><br /> <hr><br /> <li><b>I asked if anyone had any [content] on Requests & Source a few days ago, and now the thread is gone. Why?</b><br /> <p>Once a request is filled on Requests &amp; Source, it is given roughly 24 hours before a staff member moves it to an appropriate board, if one exists. This is for organizational purposes.</p><br /> </li><br /> <hr><br /> <li><b>Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?</b><br /> <p>You've got to be kidding me. I've been further even more decided <span style="color:#000000"><b>[DATA EXPUNGED]</b></span></p><br /> </li><br /> <hr><br /> <li><b>I heard from a friend that he read on [website] that U-18Chan was responsible for [action] and this upsets me. How could you do this U-18Chan?</b><br /> <p>Don't believe everything you read on the Internet. If you are genuinely interested in this site's history, or want to know what part we may have had in an event, either make a thread asking on Lounge, send us an email, or come and have a friendly chat in here.</p><br /> </li><br /> <hr><br /> <li><b>The rules say that even drawn or digital pornographic depictions of beastiality are illegal, doesn't that mean yiffy art is illegal and against the rules?</b><br /> <p>The United Kingdom laws, and hence our rules, are targeted at depictions of animals engaging in sexual acts with humans. Although Furries (some more than others) have animal characteristics, they are fictional. Ferals engaging with furries is a gray area that we allow to pe posted only in the basement Feral board. But absolutely no beastiality nor any drawings of human with ferals will be tolerated and will result in a ban.</p><br /> </li><br /> <hr><br /> <li><b>Why are drawn and digital images of child pornography and bestiality against the rules? That's stupid.</b><br /> <p>It is against the law, not the rules. Our server is hosted in the United Kingdom, so we will abide by the laws there. U-18Chan has no official stand on this subject. The opinions of individual staff members does not reflect on this website. Also, YOU are stupid.</p><br /> </li><br /> <hr><br /> <li><b>Can I post furry cub images?</b><br /> <p>Yes but do not post it outside of the Cub board. Regardless of whatever you think or have heard, we here at U-18Chan describe cub as furries with the visual age of babies or toddlers. Staff members will use their own judgment if material if this nature is in question.</p><br /> </li><br /> <hr><br /> <li><b>Someone told me that posting [content] is not allowed, should I trust him?</b><br /> <p>No. If something is not allowed on U-18Chan, it will be stated in the rules. If anyone tells you otherwise then they are a filthy liar, or mentally impaired. If it is the latter, please be nice to them. Retards have feelings too.</p><br /> </li><br /> <hr><br />  <li><b>How do I make sure people are not imitating me?</b><br /> <p>All image boards are equipped with the ability to use what are called 'trip codes'. If you place a "#" character after your name, followed by any combination of characters you can remember, just like a password, then when you post a series of characters generated by the board software in a slightly different font. The same set of characters will appear every time you use your trip code on any image board. This is the most common way of identifying that you are the same person. You can also use a 'secure tripcode' by using two "#" symbols instead of one. A secure tripcode will generate a different set of characters for each board you use on each site.</p><br /> </li><br /> <hr><br /> <li><b>Can you delete [user]'s post in the [content] thread on [board]? He/she is saying negative things about the comic and/or that he/she said he/she does not like the artist who made it. Hypocrite.</b><br /> <p>First, try not being so vague next time. Secondly, no. He/she is allowed to talk about what he/she does not like about a specific piece of art, or an artist in general. This is called critiquing. If you want, you could comment on their post, causing a conversation. I know, it sounds crazy, but trust me. They are not a hypocrite for expressing their negative opinion. However attacking other users because of their opinion could be flagged as flaming and result in a ban.</p><br /> </li><br /> <hr><br /> <li><b>Do I need to bump threads?</b><br /> <p>No, threads on U-18Chan do not 404, therefore bumping of threads is not necessary, in fact, any "bump" posts are against the rules.</p><br /> </li><br /> <hr><br /> <li><b>What happened to the old site and the old old site?</b><br /> <p>The old old site was on ImageBoard4Free until it went offline one day. We eventually purchased our own server and ran the site off of Kusaba X. Eventually, the poorly coded software overloaded the server, so we came into contact with the ImageBoard4Free creator and got the course code he wrote for his site. We then transferred our Kusaba X database onto the ImageBaord4Free software, which is far more stable. Then a the server farm we had our server colo'd in had some kind of power fault that fried all our drives so we had to start over from some really old backups.</p><br /> </li><br /> <hr><br /> <li><b>I want to send a picture to my friend from my hard drive, can I upload it to any of the boards and send them the link that way?</b><br /> <p>So long as the image or images are related to the boards they are posted on, and they are left up for everyone to share, go ahead. However, U-18Chan is NOT a free image hosting website. http://imgur.com is much better suited for that sort of stuff.</p><br /> </li><br /> <hr><br /> <li><b>A post says "<span style="color: red;"><b>(This post was made from a proxy.)</b></span>", what does this mean?</b><br /> <p>When someone posts using a proxy and we find out, we ban that proxy as per the rules. We will also put this text on a proxy post so people know. This is useful for preventing ban evasion, trolling, and samefagging.</p><br /> </li><br /></ol><br /><br /><hr><br /><br /><p><span style="font-size:1.25em"><b>U-18Chan Feature List:</b></span></p><br /><br /><p><b>Standard Image board features:</b></p><br /><br /><ul><br /> <li>Sage: Whenever you post, the thread you posted in is bumped to the top position on the first page for that board. If you enter "sage" in the email field, the thread will not be bumped.</li><br /> <li>noko: Like sage, this is entered into the email field when posting. If you post using noko, you will be redirected to the thread you posted in or started after hitting submit, rather than the first page of the board.</li><br /> <li>Watch Thread: This adds the thread selected to the Watched Threads list. This list will let you know when a new post is made, even when browsing other board. You can see you can see and manage your watched threads list by clicking the "WT" link in the top right corner of each page.</li><br /> <li>Quote: Putting a ">" symbol before a line of text will make it appear in a different colour. This is used for quoting other posts, similarly to an email.</li><br /></ul><br /><br /><p><b>Features that are unique to U-18Chan:</b></p><br /><br /><ul><br /> <li>Multi-file Upload: You are able to upload up to five files in one post on select boards.</li><br /> <li>Post linking: In order to make a link to another post in your post, either click on the post ID, or manually enter it with ">>" in front. An example would be ">>23864". This would link to post number 23864. Most image boards support this, but they require an extra step to link between boards. U-18Chan uses one pool of post numbers for all boards, so this is not required. This mean you can post a link to /fur/ when on /c/, as an example.</li><br /> <li>Indices: Select boards have an index. The index of a board shows the subject and image of the first post of every thread on the board.</li><br /> <li>Report Post: You can tick the box next to any posts you think should be brought to our attention and select the Report option in the bottom right corner of the page if you like.

<div class="NewsTitleStrip">Rules</div>
<div class="NewsContent">
Do not post child pornography<br /><br />This includes both fictional and photographic images depicting children under the age of 18 in indecent, nude, suggestive or otherwise sexual situations. This rule applies to all boards, including /pb/. Any images involving the exploitation of minors falls under this rule. A violation of this rule will result in a permanent ban.<br /><br /><br />Do not post cub outside of /cub/, the designated board<br /><br />U-18Chan describes cub as fictional furry depictions of babies or toddlers. Basically anyone who has not hit puberty yet. This means teenage characters and older do not qualify as cub. If you are unsure, just post them on /cub/ - (AKA The Cub Board). If you're not positive that something qualifies as cub and it is posted outside the board by mistake, or otherwise, moderators may move it later if necessary. You will not be banned for making this mistake. <br /><br /><br />Do not post bestiality<br /><br />Within the context of U-18Chan's rules, bestiality is considered as indecent, nude, suggestive or otherwise sexual interactions between humans and animals. Explicit images depicting animals having sexual intercourse is also not allowed. Drawn, animated, or otherwise is allowed but only on /f/ - Feral. Violation of this rule will result in a week long (7 day) ban. Note that this only pertains to actual animals. <br /><br /><br />Do not make flame posts<br /><br />This is considered as unnecessary insults or abuse directed at users, organisations or staff. This includes abuse directed at people who may not browse U-18Chan.<br /><br /><br />Do not make troll posts<br /><br />This is considered as attempting to start or inflame an argument by bringing up volatile topics, encouraging users to argue or acting to maliciously affect the community. Violation of this rule may result in a warning, post removal, a ban or your humiliation through Gentleman Protocol.<br /><br /><br />Do not spam or flood<br /><br />Spam is considered to mean posting advertisements, referral links, or other annoying posts which are irrelevant to the topic or board. Flooding is considered to mean the repeated posting of something to annoy users or gain attention. Spamming and flooding will generally result in a ban (often permanent), and the removal of the offending post(s). Additionally the post, or parts of it, may be filtered to prevent it being posted in future.<br /><br /><br />Do not post personal information(with malicious intent)<br /><br />Personal information is considered to mean any information which could be used to identify another user such as real names and personal email addresses. If this rule is violated by accident, then generally the post will be edited, and you will be warned. If this is done deliberately with malicious intent, then you will most likely be banned.<br /><br /><br />Do not abuse the tagging system<br /><br />This is considered as the deliberate addition of false tags or the removal of correct tags. Violation of this rule will most likely result in a ban.<br /><br /><br />Do not use foul language<br /><br />Any users called Tinus or Ron who use foul language can expect a permanent ban.<br /><br /><br />Do not post requests outside of Requests and Source - /rs/<br /><br />All requests for content that you want posted on the Furry Related boards MUST be made in /rs/. Violation of this rule will result in an instant 3 day ban, though this is meant as a warning so feel free to appeal the ban. You will not be banned for making a request inside a thread so long as your request is relevant to that thread.<br />Non-comic threads made with less than 3 images to start with should be posted in /rs/. This is to prevent cluttering up boards with many small threads of super-specific topics/fetishes. Comics are exempt from this rule to prevent in progress comics with few released paged from being moved around.<br /><br /><br />Tag any irrelevant images you post or see on the Furry Related boards with &macro&. You will not be banned for failing to do so, but it helps everyone on the site out by hiding all of the irrelevant images from the thread. Have some courtesy.<br /><br /><br />If you are banned you should appeal your ban or wait it out. Appeals with no text or with foul language will be rejected. Evading your ban will result in a longer one and your ISP may be contacted.<br /><br /><br />Please refrain from using anonymising proxies. If we discover you are using one, your proxy will probably be banned.<br /><br /><br />Follow the instructions of staff, they can be identified as Moderators or Administrators by # MOD # or # ADMIN # capcodes by their username. Failure to do so may result in your post being removed or a ban of at least 3 days.<br /><br /><br /><br />You may express your opinions, so long as they do not violate U-18Chan's rules. Be aware that commenting on volatile topics in irrelevant threads may well be perceived by staff as trolling. As there is a specific board for discussion, /d/, you may well be asked by a member of staff to continue a discussion there if it starts in a thread on a Furry Related board.<br /><br /><br /><br />U-18Chan is run off user submitted content.

You have no right to use my website and you have no rights on it. This isn't the United States of America. This is not a church for you to protest in front of. You'll get a lot further by talking to us like an adult over ban issues or deleted posts than by demanding we do things, claiming we are suppressing free speech, or calling us Nazis. If you don't like it then you can leave. Less bandwidth for us to pay for.
