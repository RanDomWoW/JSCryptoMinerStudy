      <div class="wnfulltext">
<p>February 2, 2018—Thanks to the development of new data reporting tools, Massachusetts high school counselors and college advisors will for the first time be able to monitor whether students have filled out the <a href="https://fafsa.ed.gov/" target="_blank"><strong>Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</strong></a>, which determines college applicants’ and returning students’ eligibility for Pell Grants, Work Study, education loans, and Massachusetts State Aid programs.</p>
<p>The <strong>Departments of Elementary and Secondary Education</strong> (DESE) and <strong>Higher Education</strong> (DHE) collaborated in the development of new reports that will be available to counselors through <a href="http://www.mass.gov/edu/docs/ese/digital-learning/edwin-analytics-overview.pdf" target="_blank">Edwin Analytics</a>, a powerful reporting and data analysis tool that gives authorized users access to a variety of reports on educational data. Beginning today, counselors and other authorized school and college personnel will have access to <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__mass.us2.list-2Dmanage.com_track_click-3Fu-3Deaf4148b3be079d053f65aba1-26id-3D2f4deb1809-26e-3Da3ca0da5c6&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=lDF7oMaPKXpkYvev9V-fVahWL0QWnGCCAfCDz1Bns_w&amp;r=M0xFqUJI13hZDW0Lkc3Ps1ZaDw18sMgF7Zt1J8GRO34&amp;m=xeEiKgO0IoFVuwxKlO9DOa03ouP36RWXaHkkLf0lRXU&amp;s=Of1J2XdtTveYFQ_9qX5ftBDfCWM7XJ8kqIDQ0OE-frc&amp;e=" target="_blank">two new FAFSA reports</a> that allow them to see whether a student has submitted a completed FAFSA to the U.S. Department of Education, or whether the application has been marked “incomplete” or “not found.” Counselors will be able to follow up with individual students to see if they need assistance in completing the FAFSA, and will also be able to monitor the overall FAFSA completion rates for their individual high school and district.</p>
<p>“One of the biggest reasons students do not graduate college is because they lack the financial resources to complete their degree. With this new data tool that helps counselors and advisors check whether individual students have completed their FAFSA, we hope more Massachusetts students will receive the necessary state and federal financial aid they qualify for in order to complete their degree,” <strong>Secretary of Education James Peyser </strong>said.</p>
<p>“I’m delighted that our respective agencies were able to collaborate on a plan to give school counselors a bird’s eye view of FAFSA completion rates,” said <strong>Carlos E. Santiago, Massachusetts Commissioner of Higher Education. </strong>“Not every student has a parent at home who is familiar with the college application process and can offer guidance in applying for financial aid. Massachusetts cannot afford to leave any students on the sidelines. With employers hungry to hire our graduates, it’s our job to make sure that every aspiring student has access to college and the career of his or her choice.”</p>
<p>“I’m happy to put this tool in the hands of high school counselors and advisors so that they can easily know when they have to remind students and families about this key step in the college admission process,” <strong>Acting Elementary and Secondary Education Commissioner Jeff Wulfson</strong> said. “We want to help schools and families work together to make college an option for all students.”</p>
<p>“I am super excited that school counselors will now have access to FAFSA completion data at their fingertips,” said <strong>Robert Bardwell, Director of School Counseling at Monson High School</strong> in Monson, MA and a member of the Board of Directors of the National Association of College Admission Counseling (NACAC). “Counselors who can either help their students complete the form or refer them to other resources for assistance may make the difference for a student wishing to achieve a higher education degree or certificate.  Many other states already provide this information to school counselors so it is wonderful to see Massachusetts doing the same. Our students will no doubt be advantaged because of this new resource.”</p>
<p>While Massachusetts currently ranks 5th in the nation for the percentage of students who complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, the overall number of high school seniors who complete the FAFSA still hovers at 48.5% statewide. Officials hope the new reports, coupled with a streamlined application and earlier filing deadline, will spur even higher completion rates. For Massachusetts students, the FAFSA filing deadline for consideration of state and federal aid is May 1, 2018, although many individual colleges have earlier deadlines.</p>
<p>The <strong>Massachusetts Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators</strong> (MASFAA) is sponsoring <a href="https://www.masfaa.org/fafsa-day-register/">FAFSA Completion events</a> for students and families through the month of February, at <strong>Mount Wachusett Community College, Middlesex Community College</strong> (Lowell campus), <strong>North Shore Community College</strong> (Lynn campus) and <strong>Quincy College</strong> (Quincy and Plymouth campuses). <a href="https://www.masfaa.org/fafsa-day-register/">Visit their website</a> for more information or to register for free assistance at one of these events. </p>

      <h2>Baker-Polito Administration Announces Preliminary Designation Status to Early College Programs</h2>
        <div class="wnteaser">21 partnerships are invited to apply for final early college designations that will go into effect this fall, with some receiving planning grants</div>
	  
  <div class="wnlink">More &gt;</div></a>
      <div class="wnfulltext">
<p>January 23, 2018—In an effort to help high school students prepare for success in college, the <strong>Boards of Higher Education</strong> and <strong>Elementary and Secondary Education</strong> invited <a href="http://www.mass.edu/strategic/ec_prelim.asp">21 higher education/K–12 partnerships</a> to move forward from the preliminary stage of the Massachusetts Early College designation process and submit an application for the final phase of the process. The Commonwealth was also able to award more than $80,000 in grants to these programs to support their work developing early college programs. </p>

<p>The $10,000 competitive planning grants will support the work for programs to meet the criteria necessary to achieve the early college designation. These programs are expected to apply for final designation in February, with the goal of launching programs this fall.</p>

<p>“Early college programs are crucial for exposing students to the opportunities higher education can create and with these designations, more students will be able to earn college credits at no cost,” <strong>Governor Charlie Baker</strong> said. “We are pleased to work with these school districts to expand or launch early college programs so their students are better prepared for successful academic and professional careers after high school.”</p>

<p>“Successful early college programs boost college completion rates for students by preparing them with challenging college-level courses,” said <strong>Lt. Governor Karyn Polito.</strong> “We are happy to be able to offer these grants that will help create high-quality early college programs for more students across the Commonwealth.”</p>

<p>Early college programs combine traditional high school courses with an opportunity to earn college credit at a public college or university, typically in a particular career pathway.</p>

<p>Successful early college programs make college more accessible to low-income students by giving them an opportunity to learn in college-level courses while at the same time earning college credits, at no cost, which helps ease their financial burdens later. Early college has also been shown to boost college completion rates for low-income students, minorities and first-generation college-goers.</p>

<p>In June, the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education and the Board of Higher Education agreed on criteria that will enable programs to become designated early college programs. Through the designation process, the Departments of Higher Education and Elementary and Secondary Education asked K–12 schools, community colleges and state universities to jointly design models. There are <a href="http://www.mass.edu/strategic/ec_designprinciples.asp">five design principles</a> for a designated early college program, including equitable access for all students.</p>

<p>“By creating designated early college programs, we are breaking down barriers between high school and higher education and creating a more seamless path for students to move to college and careers,” <strong>Education Secretary James Peyser</strong> said. “Successful early college programs do more than just prepare a student theoretically; they make students realize college is an achievable goal for them by exposing them to college-level work and college credits before they graduate high school.”</p>

<p>“I’m delighted to see the Commonwealth making this commitment to early college programs,” said <strong>Carlos E. Santiago, Commissioner of Higher Education.</strong> “We know that 70% of Massachusetts jobs will require today’s high school students to have some kind of post-secondary degree or certification. Early college will help us create a new pipeline to college for students who may have felt it was beyond their reach.”</p>

<p>“We know that early college programs help motivate students,” <strong>Elementary and Secondary Education Acting Commissioner Jeff Wulfson</strong> said. “We want to lead the nation in making these programs available in our high schools.”</p>

<p>Last March, Governor Charlie Baker announced efforts to significantly increase the number of early college seats available to high school students. Currently there are approximately 2,400 students enrolled in early college programs around the state. </p>

<p>In 2016, the Boards of Higher Education and Elementary and Secondary Education looked at whether the state could devise an early college strategy. They commissioned <a href="http://parthenon.ey.com/po/en/perspectives/breaking-down-silos-to-put-students-on-the-path-to-success--the-promise-of-early-college-in-massachusetts" target="_blank">a study</a>, done by <strong>Parthenon-EY Education Practice,</strong> to look at what exists in Massachusetts and the possibility of expanding successful models. The report found early college is a promising model that narrows educational opportunity gaps, and existing programs were a powerful base from which to build a broader statewide early college initiative.</p>

<p>January 19, 2018—The Massachusetts Department of Higher Education is pleased to announce the 2018 winners of its competitively awarded <a href="../strategic/read_bridges.asp">Bridges to College</a> grants, established by the Massachusetts Legislature in FY14 to help prepare adult learners for success in college. With  declining high school enrollments and 600,000 older workers set to retire in  the next decade, growing numbers of non-traditional adult students will be  needed to fill jobs in high-skilled industries that drive Massachusetts&rsquo;  economy. The state&rsquo;s public colleges and universities are working with the  non-profit sector, businesses and local industries to create programs and  opportunities to help adult learners transition to college and career  opportunities.</p>
<p>Four awardees were chosen to receive grants from among 12 competitors for funds: </p>
<ul style="font-size:inherit;">
  <li><strong>
    <a href="http://collegebounddorchester.org/" target="_blank">College Bound Dorchester</a>, Boston, MA, </strong>will receive $135,000 to launch a pilot program to serve gang-involved young adults from high-crime areas of Boston with the goal of helping them enroll in college pathway programs.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.jvs-boston.org/our-services/advance-your-education/prepare-for-college/" target="_blank">Jewish Vocational Service (JVS)</a>, Boston, MA,</strong> will use a $72,000 grant award to help non-native English speakers and low-income adults prepare for the rigors of college coursework and employment in their field of study. Building on a successful FY17 grant initiative, JVS’ Bridges to College and Careers program will enroll 30 students, of which 75% are expected to matriculate into college.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://mwcc.edu/" target="_blank">Mount Wachusett Community College</a>, Gardner, MA, </strong>will continue to work with the Worcester County Sheriff’s Office to offer college courses to 60 inmates at the Worcester County House of Corrections and the Fitchburg Community Corrections Center. The project, funded at $59,340, will focus on improving the “handoff” between the prison and the College to enable more inmates to continue their studies post-release.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.necc.mass.edu/" target="_blank">Northern Essex Community College</a>, Haverhill, MA, </strong>has received $75,900 to supplement existing adult bridge services. The College’s program funded by DHE will serve 18–20 adult English language learners and low-income adults who hope to enter college and attain a credential or degree leading to employment in a high-demand field.</li>

        <div class="wnfulltext">
          <p>Boston, MA – April 3, 2017 – The Massachusetts Department  of Higher Education brings its &ldquo;Go Higher!&rdquo; campaign to promote the state&rsquo;s  public colleges and universities to Newton South High School Tuesday night,  April 11 at 7 p.m., as Higher Education Commissioner Carlos E. Santiago urges  Newton families to consider new programs and opportunities available through  the state&rsquo;s public higher education system.          </p>
          <p>The &ldquo;Go Higher!&rdquo; program, to which Newton North and  Brookline High School families have also been invited, will feature remarks by  Santiago and a panel of students currently attending half a dozen public  campuses across the Commonwealth. Admissions officers from many of the public  colleges and universities plan to be in attendance.          </p>
          <p>The event will also give families a chance to learn more  about the <a href="http://www.mass.edu/macomcom">Commonwealth Commitment</a>  program announced by Governor Baker last spring. Through the program, students  transferring from any community college to any state university or UMass  campuses are eligible to save up to 49% off the cost of a four-year degree, if  they attend full-time and maintain a 3.0 GPA. The program will expand next fall  to cover more than 16 majors at all 28 public undergraduate institutions.          </p>
          <p>&ldquo;Families already know that our public colleges and  universities are more affordable; now we want to spread the word about the high  caliber of our academic programs, the increase in internship and study abroad  opportunities, our honors programs and new facilities,&rdquo; said Commissioner  Santiago. &ldquo;We know that in every community, parents are worrying about college  costs but also wanting the very best for their children. Especially for  students who see graduate school in their future, we think that making smart  decisions about the undergraduate experience is more important than ever.  That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re stepping our efforts to promote the value of public higher  education in the Commonwealth.&rdquo;          </p>
          <p>The &ldquo;Go Higher!&rdquo; campaign reminds students that by 2020,  72% of the jobs in Massachusetts will require some post-secondary education. In  an economy powered by health care and technology-related industries, the  greatest need for skilled talent is at the baccalaureate level and higher. At  events occurring at high school venues across the state, students from the  University of Massachusetts, state universities and community colleges have  spoken directly to thousands of high school students, sharing their  advice about choosing a college and a major,  adjusting to campus life, and preparing for careers through internships and  research opportunities. This year, students are also promoting their experience  – and savings earned – by transferring from community colleges to four-year  institutions.          </p>
          <p>&ldquo;It was a tremendous launching pad to get where I want to  be,&rdquo; Massachusetts Maritime Academy student Paul Frost told high school  students at a recent event, speaking of his experience studying at a community  college before he transferred to Mass Maritime. He will graduate this fall with  a degree in International Maritime Business, one of the majors available to  students at a discount through the Commonwealth Commitment program.          </p>

        <div class="wnfulltext">
        <p>The organizers of the Massachusetts STEM Summit are pleased to announce the launch of the 2017 Call for Sessions and Exhibits.</p>
<p>The theme for this year's Summit - Progress Through Partnership - celebrates the rich tradition of creative collaboration that has been the hallmark of the Commonwealth's powerful STEM movement since its earliest inception. Over the years, the Summit has presented countless examples of initiatives in which partners from diverse sectors have come together to leverage each others' complementary strengths, expertise, and resources. These cooperative efforts have yielded innovative, dynamic, and effective STEM programs for in-school and out-of-school education, and workforce development. </p>
<p>Both sessions and exhibit proposals are encouraged to highlight these cooperative efforts. Whether large or small, statewide or local, public or private, partnerships of diverse stakeholders remain crucial to the state's continued STEM success. Throughout this year's Summit - through talks, presentations and exhibits - we look to showcase many more of these unique partnerships and their exciting, cutting-edge programs and collaborations.</p>
<p>
However, please note that this is not at all a requirement; proposals on topics not involving partnerships are equally encouraged.</p>
<p>
Proposals for Breakout Sessions and Resource Exhibits may address any of the Summit's topical strands:   </p>
<ul>
<li>Early Education</li>
<li>Higher Education</li>
<li>K-12 Education</li>
<li>Workforce and Business</li></ul>

          <p>February 3, 2017 &#8211; In recent days, STEM education on Cape Cod sounded like eggs breaking - hundreds of eggs.</p>
          <p>More than 900 students from 16 schools on the Cape - and one in the Dominican Republic - participated in egg-drop challenges that saw them pushing carefully wrapped raw eggs off platforms at intervals of 1, 2, 3 and 4 feet.</p>
          <p>Called the Egghead Helmet Experiment, the project was sponsored by the Cape Cod Regional STEM Network and designed to encourage students to think like engineers while learning about the dangers of concussions.</p>
          <p>Each student or student team received an egg-protection kit consisting of pipe cleaners, a straw, string, a tissue, a napkin and a bit of bubble wrap.</p>
          <p>It was up to them to figure how to best use the materials - contained in a plastic cup &quot;helmet&quot; - to protect the eggs from cracking and smashing.</p>
          <p>&quot;It challenges students to think beyond their regular classes,&quot; said Fran Laporte, who teaches seventh- and eighth-grades classes in entrepreneurship, engineering and digital citizenship at Mashpee Middle-High School.</p>

          <p>The Baker-Polito Administration announced today that the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. have selected Massachusetts as one of 10 states to receive a $1.95 million grant to strengthen and expand high-quality career-education pathways for students.</p>
          <p>The grant, which will be distributed over the next three years, is part of the $75 million, five-year New Skills for Youth initiative developed by JPMorgan Chase in collaboration with CCSSO and Advance CTE and aims to strengthen career-focused education starting in high school and ending with postsecondary degrees and/or industry-recognized credentials aligned with high-skill jobs.</p>
          <p>&quot;Our administration has focused on aligning our K-12 schools and higher education system with the needs of our workforce so that our students, employers, and communities will share a stronger future,&quot; <strong>said Governor Charlie Baker.</strong> &quot;Lieutenant Governor Polito and I are honored that Massachusetts and the potential of our students will be recognized through this grant.&quot; </p>
          <p>&quot;We thank JPMorgan, the Council of Chief State School Officers and other partners who have helped make this grant award possible,&quot; <strong>said Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito.</strong> &quot;This New Skills for Youth grant complements our administration's prioritization of STEM-focused career education by developing more high-quality pathway programs and expanding the number of students who graduate from high school with college credits and real world experience.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;This important grant opportunity comes at an optimal time for the Commonwealth and perfectly aligns with our administration's career and technical education priorities for Massachusetts in this and coming years,&quot; <strong>said Secretary of Education Jim Peyser.</strong> &quot;Creating high-quality career pathways will not only offer our students and their families more opportunities to succeed in school and in their careers, but also help strengthen the Massachusetts economy.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Constant changes in technology and globalization make it imperative for the Commonwealth to increase opportunities for skill acquisition for all our students,&quot; <strong>Secretary of Labor and Workforce Development Ronald L. Walker, II, said.</strong> &quot;This grant will help us continue the work of creating effective career on-ramps for younger workers through education pathways.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;I am thrilled that Massachusetts students will be among the beneficiaries of this grant,&quot; <strong>said Massachusetts Elementary and Secondary Education Commissioner Mitchell Chester.</strong> &quot;I look forward to continuing our collaboration with educators and industry to set students on a clear path toward their own career goals.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;This grant will have enormous impact for some of our neediest students,&quot; <strong>said Higher Education Commissioner Carlos E. Santiago.</strong> &quot;We owe it to them to make sure that career exposure and training is integrated into a robust curriculum that will give them what every employer demands – a full box of workplace-ready tools, including quantitative reasoning skills, critical thinking skills, and the ability to write well, to work as part of a team and to lead.&quot;</p>
          <p>Massachusetts has received the grant from CCSSO for the New Skills for Youth initiative after a rigorous review process, which included examination of the state's plan to transform the process of designing and developing career preparedness education programs.</p>
          <p>This includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Launching a major competitive grant program to fund the creation of high-quality career pathways that fully prepare students for high-skill, high-wage careers; </li>
            <li>Developing a comprehensive career advisement system in partnership with the Massachusetts School Counselors Association so that all students can make more informed college and career choices; and</li>
            <li>Creating clear guidelines to help high schools develop and implement high-quality career pathways that will better prepare students for success after graduation.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&quot;Preparing our youth for high-quality and in-demand careers is critical to the future strength of our communities,&quot; <strong>said Rick MacDonald, head of commercial banking in New England for JPMorgan Chase</strong>. &quot;This investment will help to open more career pathways and give more young people the chance to learn, compete, and succeed.&quot; </p>
          <p>&quot;Bunker Hill Community College is committed to creating clear pathways to fulfilling careers for our students,&quot; <strong>said Bunker Hill Community College President Pam Eddinger,</strong> whose institution participated on the state team applying for the grant<strong>. </strong>&quot;This grant will allow us to continue this important work through our partnerships with local businesses and corporations and well as high schools.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;As an employer, I know how critical career-focused education is, and it has been exciting to be part of the team pursuing this grant,&quot; <strong>said Susan Coghlin Mailman, president of Coghlin Electric Contractors, Inc. </strong>&quot;I appreciate the coordinated effort that our state is putting forth in order to strengthen opportunities for our youth which will ultimately create a stronger and more qualified work force.&quot;</p>
          <p>In March 2016, JPMorgan Chase and CCSSO awarded Massachusetts a $100,000 grant as part of the first phase of the New Skills for Youth initiative for planning and early implementation of long-term career readiness education programs that align with the needs of employers. Twenty-four states and the District of Columbia received Phase I grants.</p>
          <p>The grant awarded today represents the second phase of the New Skills for Youth initiative, which provides 10 of the original 24 recipients with funding to execute the career-readiness plans they developed during the first phase.</p>

        <div class="wnteaser">April 11th Event at Newton South to Educate Parents, Students About New “Commonwealth Commitment” Program, Opportunities at UMass, State Universities and Community Colleges</div>	  
      <div class="wnlink">More &gt;</div></a>
        <div class="wnfulltext">
          <p>Boston, MA – April 3, 2017 – The Massachusetts Department  of Higher Education brings its &ldquo;Go Higher!&rdquo; campaign to promote the state&rsquo;s  public colleges and universities to Newton South High School Tuesday night,  April 11 at 7 p.m., as Higher Education Commissioner Carlos E. Santiago urges  Newton families to consider new programs and opportunities available through  the state&rsquo;s public higher education system.          </p>
          <p>The &ldquo;Go Higher!&rdquo; program, to which Newton North and  Brookline High School families have also been invited, will feature remarks by  Santiago and a panel of students currently attending half a dozen public  campuses across the Commonwealth. Admissions officers from many of the public  colleges and universities plan to be in attendance.          </p>
          <p>The event will also give families a chance to learn more  about the <a href="http://www.mass.edu/macomcom">Commonwealth Commitment</a>  program announced by Governor Baker last spring. Through the program, students  transferring from any community college to any state university or UMass  campuses are eligible to save up to 49% off the cost of a four-year degree, if  they attend full-time and maintain a 3.0 GPA. The program will expand next fall  to cover more than 16 majors at all 28 public undergraduate institutions.          </p>
          <p>&ldquo;Families already know that our public colleges and  universities are more affordable; now we want to spread the word about the high  caliber of our academic programs, the increase in internship and study abroad  opportunities, our honors programs and new facilities,&rdquo; said Commissioner  Santiago. &ldquo;We know that in every community, parents are worrying about college  costs but also wanting the very best for their children. Especially for  students who see graduate school in their future, we think that making smart  decisions about the undergraduate experience is more important than ever.  That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re stepping our efforts to promote the value of public higher  education in the Commonwealth.&rdquo;          </p>
          <p>The &ldquo;Go Higher!&rdquo; campaign reminds students that by 2020,  72% of the jobs in Massachusetts will require some post-secondary education. In  an economy powered by health care and technology-related industries, the  greatest need for skilled talent is at the baccalaureate level and higher. At  events occurring at high school venues across the state, students from the  University of Massachusetts, state universities and community colleges have  spoken directly to thousands of high school students, sharing their  advice about choosing a college and a major,  adjusting to campus life, and preparing for careers through internships and  research opportunities. This year, students are also promoting their experience  – and savings earned – by transferring from community colleges to four-year  institutions.          </p>
          <p>&ldquo;It was a tremendous launching pad to get where I want to  be,&rdquo; Massachusetts Maritime Academy student Paul Frost told high school  students at a recent event, speaking of his experience studying at a community  college before he transferred to Mass Maritime. He will graduate this fall with  a degree in International Maritime Business, one of the majors available to  students at a discount through the Commonwealth Commitment program.          </p>

        <div class="wnfulltext">
        <p>The organizers of the Massachusetts STEM Summit are pleased to announce the launch of the 2017 Call for Sessions and Exhibits.</p>
<p>The theme for this year's Summit - Progress Through Partnership - celebrates the rich tradition of creative collaboration that has been the hallmark of the Commonwealth's powerful STEM movement since its earliest inception. Over the years, the Summit has presented countless examples of initiatives in which partners from diverse sectors have come together to leverage each others' complementary strengths, expertise, and resources. These cooperative efforts have yielded innovative, dynamic, and effective STEM programs for in-school and out-of-school education, and workforce development. </p>
<p>Both sessions and exhibit proposals are encouraged to highlight these cooperative efforts. Whether large or small, statewide or local, public or private, partnerships of diverse stakeholders remain crucial to the state's continued STEM success. Throughout this year's Summit - through talks, presentations and exhibits - we look to showcase many more of these unique partnerships and their exciting, cutting-edge programs and collaborations.</p>
<p>
However, please note that this is not at all a requirement; proposals on topics not involving partnerships are equally encouraged.</p>
<p>
Proposals for Breakout Sessions and Resource Exhibits may address any of the Summit's topical strands:   </p>
<ul>
<li>Early Education</li>
<li>Higher Education</li>
<li>K-12 Education</li>
<li>Workforce and Business</li></ul>
 
<p>Guidelines for the preparation and submission of proposals, as well as the proposal forms, can be downloaded from the <a href="http://mass-stem-summit.org/call-for-proposals" target="_blank">Summit website</a>.</p>
