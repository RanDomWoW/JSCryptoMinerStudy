		<h5><a name="ClancyQuote">An Artist</a></h5>
		<hr class="hzlinespacerblank" />		
		<div class="textbox">
		<p><strong>Tom Clancy</strong> is a name that many recognize. Tom was a friend and patron of mine, a great guy who was extremely well-versed in military history and process,
			and one of the greatest authors who ever lived. While the younger generation may recognize his name in the gaming and simulator field, his mastery of words, 
			ideas, and literature was the absolute pinnacle of his genre. He wrote about many of the world's cold war and post-cold war military hardware, and I was hugely 
			honored to have my work in his home, in his library, and as the inspiration for charitable causes. It is because of Tom that I have a piece in the Tower of London,
			perhaps the finest weapons museum in the world. In 1994, this is what he wrote about me and my work:</p>
	</div>

		<p><em>&quot;You know, I never believed in decorous weapons until I met Jay Fisher. Where does 
			one draw the line between a fighting knife and a work of art? </em> </p>
		<p><em>Jay Fisher is a throwback to the age when craftsmen 
			were *all* artists, not mere producers of products, when every item that went 
			out the door had a story and a purpose all its own, and when you went to a 
			craftsman not because of what you wanted but because of who he was.</em></p>
		<p><em>Jay is a guy who knows how to use the modern to 
			serve the past. We really do make better steel today than we did a hundred years 
			ago - the idea of cutting an ancient Samurai sword in two with a modern American 
			knife does have its attractions - and the blend of old and new in his work is 
			totally seamless. A knight Templar would not have hesitated a moment to take 
			Fisher&#39;s steel on his Holy Quest. In fact, he would have thought the 
			technological edge a gift from an especially attentive God. </em> </p>
		<p><em>I suppose that says it all. Jay Fisher is one of a 
			kind, a man who knows the riddle of steel, and that the difference between a 
			good weapon and a bad one is the combination of how you make it and to whom you 
			give it.&quot;</em></p>

		<h5>A Maker of Military Edged Weapons and Tools</h5>
		<p>&quot;Jay Fisher is the best modern knife maker around, pursuing an 
			ancient tradition but beautifully perfecting the craft by selecting the 
			finest man-made and natural materials. Jay Fisher makes every type of 
			edged steel weapon, fitting the blade to it’s purpose. The world’s elite 
			clandestine rescue and tactical squads seek his weapons. Their lives 
			depend on Jay Fisher Custom Knives- the best quality knives in the 
			world.&quot;</p>

			<h5>A Fine Craftsman</h5>
			<p><strong>Named &quot;The Best Living Knife Maker&quot; in the 2007 Best of the West Sourcebook by True West Publications</strong></p>
			<p>&quot;Many fine knifemakers exist in the world. Some Excel at making weapons, others 
			at creating art. At his Enchanted Spirits Studio in Clovis, New Mexico, Jay 
			Fisher does both. In the blade business since 1988, Fisher makes knives, many 
			featuring gemstone handles, for collectors, museums and people who really know 
			how to use &#39;em (101st Airborne, Special Forces, USAF Pararescue).&quot;
