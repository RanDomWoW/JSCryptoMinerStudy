					<p>&quot;Twas the 19th year Norrath had become<br />Nearly two decades of friends and fun<br />Adventurers surround of many skills and sizes<br />All questing fiercely for untold epic prizes.<br /><br /><br />I raise my tankard of JumJum to you all<br />Adventuring together, we shall never fall<br />I toast all of EverQuest&#039;s heroes and fans<br />And will look to see you in our lands.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />TRAIN!&quot;<br /><br /><br />-Holly &quot;Windstalker&quot; Longdale, Executive Producer, Senior Druid, Aspiring Bard<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />--<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Hail and well met, Norrathians!<br /><br />It&#039;s a time for merriment as we all celebrate EverQuest&#039;s 19th Anniversary!<br /><br />It&#039;s hard to believe another year has come and gone, and this year is already flying by. As always, we like to take this chance to remind you all how appreciative we are to you, our player family, for sticking with us year after year. It is truly because of you that Norrath continues on.<br /><br />Staying true to form, there are a whole variety of ways to celebrate this anniversary with us and it&#039;s hard to know where to even start! The team has put together four new missions for the 19th Anniversary, each with hidden bonus rewards for you to try to complete. In addition, like we do every year, we&#039;ll be bringing back previous anniversary content going back through our 5th anniversary. These events will turn on and off at different times, and we&#039;re keeping the festivities going well into May.<br /><br />If you want to get something to commemorate this special occasion there is a new mount available from the jubilant merchant and some limited-time armor sets available on the Marketplace. I hope you&#039;re as excited for the Lava Sessiloid mount as I am!<br /><br />On ALL servers we&#039;ll be celebrating anniversary with 50% bonus experience starting today and lasting until the end of the month.&nbsp; This bonus also applies to our newest Progression Server, Coirnav! We dove into Coirnav ourselves this morning on our 19th Anniversary livestream, where a few of our team members started their EverQuest adventure over with new characters. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EverQuestLive" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">You can watch the replay here.</a><br /><br />The team here was hard at work to make sure EverQuest&#039;s 19th Anniversary is a great one, and if you want more details about everything happening then can you can <a href="https://www.everquest.com/news/eq-19th-anniversary-celebration-march-2018" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">read up more here.</a><br /><br />The team has also been hard at work on other content... including this year&#039;s expansion! We&#039;re not ready to share anything yet, but that time will come soon enough.<br /><br />Once again, happy 19th Anniversary Norrathians!<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />See you in Norrath! <br /><br />Lauren &quot;Mooncast&quot; McLemore<br /><br />Producer, EQ &amp; EQ2</p>

We&#039;re grateful for all of you who have made this possible. Keep an eye out for new and returning special events in the upcoming weeks!<br />- Have you been looking for an opportunity to start fresh? Our newest Progression Server, Coirnav, launches on March 16, 2018! See the forums for details.<br />- Bristlebane&#039;s been rummaging around in his vault recently and has found some once-lost items! Check the Marketplace for limited time offers during the 19th Anniversary!<br /><br /><br />*** Items ***<br />- Adjusted the base modification of Jeweled Skull of Null to make the stats closer to the group version if you have completed no Veeshan&#039;s Peak raids.<br />- Procs on weapons can now activate if the item has a click cooldown that is different from the spell activated on a proc.<br />- Removed the small knockback from Rain of the Overthere on Hoarded Worker Sledgemallet and Jeweled Hoarded Worker Sledgemallet.<br />- New player starting tunics can no longer be traded and have no value.<br />- Fixed the spelling of Deathseeker on three items.<br /><br /><br />*** Tradeskills ***<br />- Fixed a problem where combine failures were not always returning the tools used.<br />- The recipe for Scaleborn Warmonger Coat now requires Combine Draconic Scale Transmogrificant.<br /><br /><br />*** Quests And Events ***<br />- End of Empire (Mission and Raid) - Fixed a bug that could cause the Unhammered and No Outbreaks achievements to fail when they should not.<br />- Hoshkar (Ring of Scale) - Smoothed out the intervals at which Hoshkar casts his spells. They should no longer cast at the same time.<br />- Balance of Power (Raid) - Fixed an issue that would prevent completion of the Ghosted achievement.<br />- Fell Foliage (Mission) - Lowered the maximum number of players allowed in this mission to 6.<br />- Jondin&#039;s Fern Flower quest can now be completed.<br />- Crypt of Sul Heroic Adventures - Removed some NPCs that should not have spawned in these missions.<br />- Reduced the level of many Heroic Adventure NPCs. This mostly affects rares in The Broken Mirror.<br />- Vex Thal - Bosses will now tether in the Agent of Change instances.<br />- Vex Thal - Akhevan Warders will again banish people.<br />- Vex Thal - Kaas Thox Xi Aten Ha Ra will no longer tether if it gravity fluxes.<br /><br /><br />*** Spells ***<br />- Detrimental beam spells no longer attempt to hit many types of invalid targets such as friendly NPCs (including pets), auras, and invulnerable NPCs. Beneficial beam spells now include friendly NPCs (including pets), and exclude enemy NPCs and players.<br />- Spell/Tome reward sets from Ring of Scale will now hide abilities you have already memorized when you view them.&nbsp; If you have used a tablet or symbol before this change but not selected a reward you will have to reuse the tablet or symbol to do so.<br />- Moved all melee timers up one ID in order to fix several timing issues with procs.<br />- Bard - Corrected an issue where certain songs would attempt to begin playing twice.<br />- Druid - Corrected the description of Chill of the Wildtender.<br />- Druid - Reduced mana costs on most DoT spells to better reflect the damage they do.<br />- Ranger - Strength of the Wildstalker should now prevent the same or lower ranks of Brell&#039;s Blessed Bastion from landing.<br />- Shaman - Increased the damage on Curse of Sisslak so that it is an upgrade to Bane as intended.&nbsp; Increased damage on higher level spells in the Blood of Saryrn DoT line as a result.<br />- Shaman - Lowered mana costs on most spells in the combined DoT lines. Fast (two tick duration) DoTs are all more efficient than their parent spells.<br />- Warrior - Corrected the descriptions for the Scowl line of abilities.<br /><br /><br />*** AA ***<br /><br />- Magician - Fixed a bug where rank 1 of Frenzied Burnout only increased 1-Hand Blunt damage rather than all melee damage.<br />- All - Quick Draw has been refunded.<br /><br /><br />*** NPCs ***<br />- NPCs will no longer summon or cast spells on the corpses of players who are hovering.<br />- Reduced the level of many Heroic Adventure NPCs. This mostly affects rares in The Broken Mirror.<br />- Encounters that have a 100% chance to generate a rare now have a delay before they will spawn. These encounters now have a respawn variance as well.<br />- Veeshan&#039;s Peak (Ring of Scale) - Changed the factions used by NPCs in the zone to be distinct from the faction in the original Veeshan&#039;s Peak. Faction loss for killing the Denizens of Veeshan&#039;s Peak will be heavy. They do not like when mortals kill their kin.<br />- Overthere (Ring of Scale) - Corrected the spelling of Fereth.<br />- Mercenary Liaison NPCs now have a more consistent category name and spelling.<br />- In the Tower of Frozen Shadow, killing an enraged vampire on floor 7 will no longer spawn Cara Omica on floor 4.<br />- Only one instance of Champion Ultharas will be active at one time in Arcstone.<br />- Ice goblins in Permafrost now have more varied names. Corrected a problem that could prevent some ice goblins from spawning if there were too many active elsewhere.<br />- The following NPCs are no longer flagged as rare:<br />- - Grandmaster R`tal, Mistress of Scorn, Lord of Ire, Lord of Loathing, Avatar of Abhorrence, High Priest M`kari, Coercer T`vala, Magi P`tasa, Ashenbone Broodmaster, Master of Spite, Muramite Commander, Ulga the Elfeater, Ogoruk the Charming, Nendor the Daunting, Zurul the Bonecruncher, Korizar the Neckbreaker, Death Fang Teraz, Alassh the Cannibal, Katazz the Twisted, Nentassh the Blade Queen, Iross the Sledge, The Steel Serpent, Akazz the Blood Goddess, Thunderstone, a rotting warchest, a Malgrin Legion warchest, a Xillsfar Legion warchest, Kael Militia Captain, an Imperial Gravemaster, Wraith of a Di`Zok Hero, Vrex High Priest, Secrets of Faydwer faction vendors, thick boned skeleton, thick tailed skeleton, thick skulled skeleton, Barkley, Bloodmaw, a froglok hunter, a froglok forager, Nosja (the common version), and Daman (the common version)<br />- The following NPCs are now flagged as rare:<br />- - Maru the Twelfth Born, A Wrulon Sentry, Tower of Frozen Shadow NPCs that are triggers to spawn rares, a large undead gnoll, an angry librarian, an enraged shadow beast, an enraged relative, Cara Omica, VhalSera, Tserrina Syl`Tor, Tenebrous NPCs that are triggers to spawn rares, Heratius Grolden, Valdanov Zevfeer, Oracle Froskil, Vessel Fryn, Knight Dragol, Master Fasliw, Dreadlord Dekir, Keeper Sepsis, Hierophant Ixyl, Harbinger Josk, Doom, Thruke, Flayhte, Dragontail, Commander Sils, Stonebeak, Ffroaak, and Throkkok<br />- Many rares have had their spawn chance or spawn time adjusted.<br /><br /><br />*** Progression Servers ***<br />- Fixed an issue where /blockspell commands would clear upon zoning.<br />- The Ice Witch and Greshvoule in Permafrost will not spawn until Planes of Power is unlocked.<br />- Recipes for Golden Idols and alchemy Distillates now require Shadows of Luclin to be unlocked.<br />- Added an Agent of Change for Theater of Blood in Arcstone. The Twisted Harmonic Chime will still be needed to request and enter this instance.<br />- Some doors in Unrest will be locked on servers that have not yet unlocked Ruins of Kunark. You may need to find the key or bring a rogue proficient with lock picks.<br />- - These keys will no longer drop on servers that have unlocked Ruins of Kunark.<br /><br /><br />*** Miscellaneous ***<br />- Fixed an issue that would cause the game to crash when entering Arx Mentis, Chapterhouse of the Fallen, and the Breeding Grounds.<br />- Fixed an issue that was causing collection or tradeskill task steps to fail outside of specific zones.<br />- Many original EverQuest zones have had their experience modifier adjusted for balance reasons and/or to encourage variety in leveling.<br /><br /><br />*** UI ***<br />- Fixed a bug where merchants would mix up the singular and plural name of currencies when buying and selling items for alternate currencies.<br />- Fixed an issue where the Window Selector would not open the map.<br />- Fixed an issue where the Map window would not open the map toolbar.<br />- Fixed an issue where the Task Overlay window was not saving its settings.<br />- Removed the potion belt and added a new hotbar.

For levels 101+ this was generally an increase.<br />- - Heroic Adventures stop scaling at the maximum level in the era they were introduced. For example, 15th anniversary and Call of the Forsaken errands released when the maximum level was 100, so even if there is a level 101+ player in the zone, the highest these adventures will scale is as if the max level player in the zone were level 100.<br />- - Heroic Adventures experience and point reward scaling have been adjusted to better reflect their difficulty.<br />- - Heroic Adventures daily quest experience and point reward scaling have been adjusted to better reflect their difficulty.<br /><br /><br />*** Spells ***<br />- Fixed a bug where some characters were unable to learn any new combat abilities.<br />- Corrected an issue where some spells erroneously displayed &#039;begins to sing a song.&lt;&gt;&#039;<br />- Berserker - Corrected the descriptions for the amount of hatred reduction on Jarring Jolt and Axe of Rekatok Jolt Effect.<br />- Cleric - Increased the AC granted by Armor of the Merciful slightly.<br />- Druid - Increased the AC granted by Arcronite Skin and Arcronite Blessing and adjusted stacking blockers so that they are no longer overwritten by Assurance.<br />- Druid - Increased the mana regeneration rate of Arcronite Skin to match Arcronite Blessing.<br />- Druid - Greatly reduced the damage of combined DoTs above level 70.
