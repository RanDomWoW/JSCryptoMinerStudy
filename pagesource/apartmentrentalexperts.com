                                    Davis Square may be the most popular spot in Somerville, full of activity ’round the clock. There are shops and coffee bars to pass the day in, and great restaurants, bars, clubs, and movie and live performance theaters for after hours. Tufts University is right up the street, and the Red Line stop in the heart of the square draws people from all over Cambridge and Boston – as well as allowing Davis Square residents to get around quickly. Davis Square is highly urban, although, by car, Middlesex Fells Reservation and the beautiful rural areas off Route 2 are easily accessible.

                                    West Medford is a pleasant suburban neighborhood just one commuter rail stop from Boston. It’s near the Mystic River, Mystic Lake and the immense Middlesex Fells Reservation with its miles of hiking trails and one of the all-time great canine social scenes at the Sheepfold on weekends.  Woof!

                                    Medford Square is a great “value play.” Less than a mile from Tufts University, it’s an up-and-coming commercial and entertainment district, with cafes, restaurants and sandwich shops. It’s also adjacent to I-93, for quick access to downtown via bus or car.

Tufts Park has a great, spa-like public pool with an inexpensive annual fee for Medford residents.  There are convenient buses – just 15 minutes to Boston on I-93 – as well as good restaurants. The Italian food is particularly delicious.
