  <h3>1) Legal Definitions</h3>
  <p>For clarity, the following phrases and words are defined as shown below when used in the context of our Terms and Conditions:</p>
  <ul class="blueli">
    <li>Any reference to "us", "our", "we" or "company" refers to our company and its subsidiaries</li>
    <li>The terms "you", "your", "yourself" and "user" refer to any individual user visiting this website</li>

    <li>"Terms" refers to this site's Terms and Conditions</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2) What We Offer</h3>
  <p>We offer to process and review electronic travel authorization applications for travel to the USA. Please note that our company and website (EvisaOnline.com) are privately owned and operated. They are not connected with any government department, agency or bureau. During your online application process you may see notes regarding further information about the travel authorization you are applying for. When you click on the associated button you are understood to be entering into an agreement with our company.</p>
  <p>All visitors to our website have the option of lodging their own applications directly on the official government portal without our assistance. The application cost for a US travel authorization is currently USD $ 14.00 charged directly by the US government. We will though not be able to assist with applications that we have not reviewed and processed.</p>

  <h3>3) Payment for our Products and Services</h3>
  <p>There is no charge to access our website, view our products/services or ask questions. However, we do charge for verifying, processing and/or reviewing applications. Before you start an ESTA application we will clearly tell you what the cost of our service will be. All individual USA ESTA applications processed are charged at USD $ 88.00 each, which includes tax and the US government mandatory fee of $ 14.00. There are no other fees charged. By completing the steps and clicking on the pay button, you are agreeing to the fee charged by our company.</p>
  <p>Payment can only be made by credit card; all major brands are accepted. The cost of the service or product will be charged in U.S. dollars ($).</p>
  <p>If you use a credit card in a currency other than U.S. dollars, your credit card provider will convert the price in U.S. dollar into your local currency using their own exchange rate. The charge will show on your statement after 4-8 days. The transaction may also incur additional fees or card-use charges levied by your credit card provider. We have no influence over such additional fees.</p>

  <h3>4) ESTA Application Processing</h3>
  <p>It is your sole responsibility to find out whether a visa is required for you to visit another country before you travel. Depending upon your nationality and personal history, you may be eligible to apply for an ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization) when traveling to the USA. To obtain an ESTA you must provide certain details about yourself, your passport and your reason for visiting the country.</p>
  <p>Our website services provide online application forms with all the questions you will need to answer in order to submit an application for ESTA. Part of our specialized service is to review the answers you provide, along with your information, before we process and submit the application on your behalf. If we need any additional information or see anything that may jeopardize your application, we will contact you by email. Please note that any verification of information will delay the processing period.</p>
  <p>Once we have ascertained that the information you have provided is valid and complete, we submit your application to the US government department for approval. If for any reason your application cannot be submitted for processing, we will inform you and refund your payment in full.</p>
  <p>As a part of our Service, we may edit the addresses submitted to match an international standardized address format required by the US government. The addresses edited on the Travel Authorization (ESTA) may be shown under CONTACT INFORMATION, TRAVEL INFORMATION and EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION.</p>
  <p>To receive a response to your ESTA application can take up to 72 hours. However, we advise all travelers to begin the ESTA application process as soon as possible, and at least 7 days before your departure in order to allow time for any unforeseen delays or problems.</p>

  <h3>5) What Happens if your E-visa or ESTA Application is Denied</h3>
  <p>If for any reason we are unable to process your application, you can submit another application using a different service provider. Alternatively, you can go directly to the relevant government website and submit an application yourself. The final decision to approve or reject any ESTA or E-visa application lies entirely with each government. If your application is denied, we recommend that you get in touch with the embassy or consulate representing the country you wish to visit and they will advise you of the best way to apply for a standard visa instead. This can take longer than a regular E-visa, so time should be allowed for this possible delay.</p>
  <p>In exceptional circumstances, a government may choose to withdraw approval for an Electronic Travel Authorization (E-visa or ESTA) even after it has been approved. In certain situations, they are authorized to change the status from 'Approved' to 'Not authorized to visit with an E-visa'. Even if your application is approved, it is only an authorization to travel. It does not guarantee entry into the country you are intending to visit. The final decision lies with the Customs and Immigration Officer when you arrive at the port of entry. We cannot take any responsibility for any losses incurred if a decision is made to decline or withdraw approval for you to enter a country. We cannot be held liable for any costs or claims resulting from such a decision.</p>

  <h3>6) Your Responsibilities</h3>
  <p>It is the sole responsibility of any traveler to comply with all requirements regarding their visit to a foreign country. You are required to answer all questions honestly and fully when making your ESTA or E-visa application. If any information is incorrect, you may not be allowed to board a flight or boat, or you may be refused entry to your intended destination country. In this instance our company cannot be held liable for any subsequent costs or inconveniences.</p>

  <h3>7) Our Contract</h3>
  <p>All orders made on our website consist of three mandatory pages with questions and payment information that must be completed by all customers. These actions can only be made by the customer who submits the order him/herself. We accept the offer to process the travel authorization once the complete application and payment are submitted. The order is accepted by us once we dispatch the email with the approved travel authorization. Purchasing our processing service indicates that the Terms and Conditions are accepted. This contract can be concluded in English or the language selected when completing the order. You have the option to withdraw from this contract by formally informing us in writing BY SUBMITTING THIS <a href="#" class="canc-anc">WITHDRAWAL FORM</a> after payment is made.</p>

However, it may be possible for some statements to include errors, oversights, outdated or missing information and we do not accept liability for any problems or financial losses that may be incurred as a result.

  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

  <h3>1) About this website</h3>
  <p>This website is operated by a private company not associated with any governments, and all services associated with this domain are provided by our company. All services and information provided by our company is for the purpose of assisting travellers applying for E-Visas (electronic travel authorisations) in order to visit a number of countries. When you visit our website for the purposes of sourcing information regarding E-Visas or American visas you automatically consent to the terms of our Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h3>2) The information we collect</h3>
    <p>Only information provided by you on a voluntary basis when you complete the application form is collected by our company. We require this information as it is necessary in order to process your E-Visa. The information you provide will only be used in order to process your application. Our company will not use it for any other purposes unless legally required to do so. Your information will be deleted from our database six months after processing has been concluded.</p>
  <p>Under certain circumstances, you may be required to agree explicitly in order to allow specified items of data to be processed. If such processing is required, you will be informed by our company, and we will request your consent. You consent to the data processing immediately upon pressing the appropriate button or making the appropriate mark on the form.</p>
  <p>We utilize a web analysis tool in order to improve our services, optimize the site, and better understand the actions of users when visiting the site. Data we collect using this tool includes any visitors' type of browser, screen resolution, time of visit, referring site and other non-identifying data. Under certain circumstances, we may transmit this data to third parties in other countries for the purposes of evaluation. When you use our website, you automatically consent to all such collecting, processing, and transmission of this data.</p>

  <h3>3) Removing your personal information after submitting it to this site</h3>
  <p>You are able to request in writing that we remove any information provided as part of an E-Visa application at any time by contacting our customer service department at <a href="mailto:info@evisaonline.net">info@evisaonline.net</a>. If you do send such a request, your personal information will immediately be deleted. Additionally, your email message (including both content and contact information) is automatically deleted after 90 days. Should you wish to have an email message deleted earlier than the 90 day period, you need to send us a request to do so via email and we will fulfil your request immediately on receipt of your email.</p>

  <h3>4) Sharing of information</h3>
  <p>The only time we might share your information is if we are legally required to provide some user information or individual access information related to law enforcement agency, court of law, or other government agency in response to their request, subpoena, or court order.</p>
  <p>We do not share your information for any marketing or other purpose.</p>

  <h3>5) Links to external domains</h3>
  <p>On our site we provide links to sites other than our own solely for the purpose of providing visitors with additional information on our services, or introduce them to sites we recommend. The fact that we provide these links, however, does not mean that we approve of or endorse the content, services or products offered by those sites. Should you follow the links, we cannot be held liable for any way you may utilise those sites, or for any content they include. When visiting the site of any third party provider, we strongly recommend you read their terms and conditions thoroughly.</p>
  <p>In some instances, visitors may arrive at our site via a link provided by a third party. In this instance, we cannot be held liable for the way the other site is utilised or for its content. We recommend you read the site’s terms and conditions thoroughly. Any third party sites with links to EvisaOnline.com are not offered by us, and are not within the control of our company. In instances where we do link to third-party sites, we make every attempt to ensure that those sites are not in violation of any legal requirements. However, it is not possible to conduct continual or permanent reviews of the status of such sites, and it would be unreasonable to expect us to do so. Any links we allow are with sites we cannot detect to have been in violation of any legal requirements. Should we detect such violations, all measures would be taken immediately in order to remedy the situation.</p>

  <h3>6) Site security</h3>
  <p>We only use HTTP over SSL – Secure Socket Layer (HTTPS) – in order to ensure the highest possible security for our site. This allows our visitors to securely enter personal information and make credit card payments. Should you come across a site that displays only HTTP rather than HTTPS in the address section of your browser, we highly recommend that you do not enter in any credit card details or personal information on that site. Our site adheres to the PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), an industry standard for businesses that accept online payments via credit card. Every month, we scan our databases and systems and our website in order to maintain compliance with PCI DSS.</p>

  <h3>7) Changes to these policies</h3>
  <p>Changes to this Privacy Policy and its content may change at any time when circumstances require. The date any changes were made will be visible to visitors on the Privacy Policy page. </p>

  <h3>8) The Directive on ePrivacy</h3>
  <p>We adhere to Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July, 2002, which outlines the requirements for Internet Service Providers regarding customer <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eprivacy-directive" target="_blank">privacy protection</a> and the manner in which all personal data is processed.</p>
