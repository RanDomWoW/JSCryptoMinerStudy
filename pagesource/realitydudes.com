    <h2>Information We May Collect Through Automatic Data Collection Technologies</h2>

        <li>information about your computer and internet connection, including your IP address, operating system and browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us. An IP, or &ldquo;Internet Protocol&rdquo;, address is a unique number associated with your computer that may be communicated to other computers and servers when you use the Internet. The information collected may include the domain name of your internet service provider, referral data (<em>g</em>., the address of the last page you visited prior to clicking through to the Website and the address of the exit page when you left our Website)&nbsp;and browser and platform type (<em>e.g</em>., a Firefox browser on a Macintosh platform). We use this information to track how users are accessing and using the Website.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking). See <a href="#howwedisclose">&ldquo;<em>Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information</em>&rdquo;</a> below for information on how you can opt out of behavioral tracking on this Website and how we respond to web browser signals and other mechanisms that enable consumers to exercise choice about behavioral tracking.</p>
    <p>The information we collect automatically is statistical data and may include personal information, or we may maintain it or associate it with personal information we collect in other ways or receive from third parties.

        <li>estimate our audience size and usage patterns;</li>
        <li>store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our Website according to your individual interests;</li>
        <li>speed up your searches; and</li>
        <li>recognize you when you return to our Website.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cookies (or browser cookies)</strong>. Cookies are small text files that are stored in your web browser or downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user&rsquo;s device. Cookies might be used for the following purposes: (i)&nbsp;to enable certain functions; (ii)&nbsp;to provide analytics; (iii)&nbsp;to store your preferences; and (iv)&nbsp;to enable ad delivery and behavioral advertising.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We currently use the following types of cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Cookies that are strictly necessary</em>: These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Website. These include, for example, cookies that enable a user to log into the members&rsquo; area of our Website and to check if a user is allowed access to a particular service or content.</li>
        <li><em>Analytical cookies</em>: These cookies allow us to recognize and count the number of users and to see how users use and explore our Website. These cookies help us to improve our Website, for example by ensuring that all users are able to find what they are looking for easily.</li>
        <li><em>Functionality cookies</em>: We are always glad to see you back. This type of cookies allows us to recognize you when you return to our Website in order to greet you by name and to remember, for example, your choice of language.</li>
        <li><em>Targeting cookies</em>: These cookies record the visit of a user on our Website, the pages a user has visited and the links a user has followed in order to enable us to make our Website more relevant to the users&rsquo; interests. In addition, these cookies are used to identify the websites and the marketing materials you are accessing our Website from in order to target content (for example, to automatically show you our Website according to your language settings).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We do not require that you accept cookies and you may withdraw your consent to our use of cookies at any time by adjusting your browser&rsquo;s privacy settings. However, if you decline to accept cookies, some functionality on our Website may be disabled and you may be unable to access certain parts of our Website. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Website. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires automatically when you close your browser. A persistent cookie will remain until it expires or you delete your cookies. Expiration dates are set in the cookies themselves; some may expire after a few minutes while others may expire after multiple years.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Flash Cookies</strong>. Certain features of our Website may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies)&nbsp;to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from and on our Website. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies. For information about managing your privacy and security settings for Flash cookies, see <a href="#howwedisclose">&ldquo;<em>Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information</em>&rdquo;.</a></li>
        <li><strong>Web Beacons</strong>. Pages of our the Website and our e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, single-pixel gifs and web bugs)&nbsp;that are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the user&rsquo;s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in an email)&nbsp;and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages or opened an e-mail, to understand usage patterns and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity). We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.</li>
        <li><strong>Device identifiers</strong>. When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Website, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, or remotely store one or more &ldquo;device identifiers&rdquo;. Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device&rsquo;s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by the Website. A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Website and may help others or us provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Website may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</li>
        <li><strong>Metadata</strong>. Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Contributions. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Contribution was collected and how that content is formatted. Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Contribution including a hashtag, comments or other data. This makes your User Contribution more searchable by others and more interactive.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics Tools</strong>. We use analytics tools and other third party technologies, such as Google Analytics and DoubleClick Cookies, to collect non-personal information in the form of various usage and user metrics when you use our Website. These tools and technologies collect and analyze certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses, device and software identifiers, referring and exit URLs, onsite behavior and usage information, feature use metrics and statistics, usage and purchase history, media access control address (MAC Address), mobile unique device identifiers, and other similar information. The third party analytics companies who collect information on our Website and other online products or services may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other websites or other online or mobile products and services relating to your activities across their network of websites as well as online or mobile products and services. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. In addition to our use of technologies as described herein, we may permit certain third party companies to help us tailor advertising that we think may be of interest to you based on your use of our Website and to otherwise collect and use data about your use of our Website. For more information about this practice, please see the <a href="#thirdparty">&ldquo;Third-party Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies&rdquo;</a> section below.</li>

Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Website, compiling reports on Website activity and providing other services relating to Website activity and internet usage to the Website. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.</p>

    <p>Some content or applications, including advertisements, on the Website are served by third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers and application providers.

    <h2>How We Protect Your Personal Information</h2>
    <p>We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures)&nbsp;to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.</p>
    <p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen)&nbsp;a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.

The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Website.</p>
    <p>We want you to feel confident using our Website. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications would always remain secure.

    <p>We may modify or revise our privacy policy from time to time in our sole discretion and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions.
