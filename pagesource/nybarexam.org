			Operating under the 
			auspices of the New York State Court of Appeals, the New York State 
			Board of Law<img alt="Picture of NYS Court of Appeals" class="style11" height="175" src="images/coa.gif" style="float: right" width="281" /> Examiners is responsible for 
			administering the bar examination to candidates seeking admission to 
			practice law in the State of New York. <br /><br />The Board has been in existence for over a hundred years, having 
			been created by the New York State Legislature in 1894. <br />Its five 
			members are attorneys appointed by the Court of Appeals. 
			The Board maintains a business office in Albany, New York with a 
			full-time staff that oversees the 
			bar examination. <br /><br />The bar examination is administered 
			twice per year, on the last Tuesday and Wednesday of February and 
			July. In 2017, the Board processed 15,699 applications for the bar 
			examination and examined 14,094 applicants.<br />

			<br />
			The results from the February 2018 bar examination will be released 
			in late April or early May.

			(3) NEW POLICY ON SEAT ASSIGNMENTS FOR BAR EXAM</strong><br />
			<br />
			<span class="style12">The Board has changed its policy concerning Test Center assignments. 
			Seating is no longer based on the applicant’s residential address as 
			provided by the applicant on the bar exam application. Test Center 
			assignments will be based on availability and on a first come, 
			first-served basis at the time of the Board’s seating assignment 
			email. No applicant is guaranteed a seat in any particular city or 
			test center, even if the applicant lives or attended law school in 
			that city. The Board’s seating assignment email is sent out after 
			the application period closes (usually in early June for a July exam 
			and early January for a February exam) and instructs applicants to 
			select a test location from the list of available locations in the 
			email. Only locations with available seats will be listed in the 
			email. First-time applicants who graduate with a Juris Doctor degree 
			from a New York State law school will be given the first opportunity 
			to select a location</span><br />

			</span>
			</strong>
			<br />
			As previously announced, in conjunction with the adoption of the 
			Uniform Bar Examination (UBE), the State Board of Law Examiners was 
			directed by the Court of Appeals to create an online course, known 
			as the New York Law Course (NYLC), and an online, open book exam on 
			New York specific law, known as the New York Law Exam (NYLE). <br />
			<br />
			The 
			first administration of the NYLE was held on May 26, 2016. <br />
			<br />
			Applicants must complete the NYLC before they may register for the 
			NYLE. The Board has prepared comprehensive Course Materials for the 
			NYLC and NYLE. Please note that the New York Course Materials (NYCM) 
			were updated in April 2017. Applicants for the New York Law Exam 
			(NYLE) should use this latest version in preparing for the NYLE. <br />
			<br />
			The Board expresses its gratitude to the many law professors, 
			practitioners and judges who assisted the Board in this endeavor and 
			particularly to the faculty of the NYLC. The New York Law Course, Course Materials, 
			Sample NYLE Questions and

			(7) NEW SKILLS COMPETENCY REQUIREMENT<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; POSTED December 30, 2015<span class="style12"><br />
			<br />
			</span>
			</strong>The Court of Appeals has added a new section 520.18 to the 
			Rules for the Admission of Attorneys and Counselors at Law (22 NYCRR 
			520.18). This new provision requires applicants seeking admission in 
			New York to establish that they have acquired skills and 
			professional values necessary to competently practice law. 
			Applicants may satisfy this requirement by completing one of five 
			separate pathways described in section 520.18. For applicants who 
			qualify for the bar examination based upon having attended an 
			ABA-approved law school and having satisfied the requirements of 
			section 520.3 or based upon their foreign legal education alone 
			under section 520.6, this requirement will first apply to those who 
			commence their legal studies after August 1, 2016. As to 
			foreign-educated applicants who are required to complete an LL.M. 
			program at an ABA-approved law school in order to sit for the bar 
			examination under section 520.6, the new requirements will apply to 
			those who commence their LL.M. program after August 1, 2018. A copy 
			of the Notice to the Bar announcing the New Skills Competency 
			Requirement and the newly enacted Section 520.18 of the Rules of the 
			Court of Appeals <br />
			For the Admission of Attorneys and Counselors at Law is available 
			at:
