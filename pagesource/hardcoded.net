<h2>About Hardcoded Software</h2>
<p>Hi there. My name is Virgil Dupras, I live in Qu√©bec, Canada. I'm a software developer and have been
for quite a while. The vocation of this website changed a lot over the years and I think that the
best "about" section would be a short history of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hardcoded.net/archive2001">In 2001</a>, I started this website to host my software, Mp3 Filter (initially written
in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarcadero_Delphi">Delphi</a> and now called <a href="https://www.hardcoded.net/dupeguru_me/">dupeGuru ME</a>) which I soon started to sell as shareware.
Things gradually went for the better and, <a href="https://www.hardcoded.net/archive2004">in 2004</a>, I could leave my day job to work
exclusively on my own software.</p>
<p>It's also in 2004 that I discover <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> which became (and still is) my favorite
programming language. I then rewrite my applications in it. Initially, the GUI layer was kept in
Delphi and worked only in Windows, but <a href="https://www.hardcoded.net/archive2006">in 2006</a>, wanting to support Mac OS X, I started
doing something I called "<a href="https://www.hardcoded.net/articles/cross-toolkit-software">cross-toolkit development</a>" which allowed me to support
multiple platforms without ending up with an ugly, non-native looking app that <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a> or
<a href="http://qt-project.org/">Qt</a> gave me on OS X.</p>
<p>Supporting Mac OS X was the beginning of real money coming in. That initially startled me because,
after all, Mac has a much lower market share than Windows. I understood that Mac users had more
money and, more importantly, had a different culture than Windows users: they were used to pay for
their software. I started really liking Mac.</p>
<p>All this time and until <a href="https://www.hardcoded.net/archive2009">2009</a>, I'm doing proprietary software. I began my career thinking
that free (as in speech) software developers were silly because they were giving their "property"
away, all for nothing. However, over time, my understanding of intellectual property evolved and in
2009, I make a leap to <a href="https://www.hardcoded.net/articles/going_open_source">try to reconcile</a> the income source of shareware with the
freedom of open source.</p>
<p>At the time, I feared a collapse of my revenue, which never happened, but I wasn't satisfied with my
solution because it wasn't really open source and didn't make total sense, in retrospective. A year
later, I leap again and <a href="https://www.hardcoded.net/articles/free-as-in-speech-fair-as-in-trade">start fairware</a>, which this time is really open source.</p>
<p>Once again, the feared collapse of revenu never happens and, quite happily, I sail through
development having finally reconciled software freedom and revenue... until <a href="https://www.hardcoded.net/archive2012">2012</a>.</p>
<p>In 10 years, I had developed a few applications, but only one ever worked commercially, dupeGuru.
dupeGuru has been very fun to work on, but after this much time, one grows tired of developing the
same application. In fact, I grew tired of "shareware type" software development altogether. So, I
took a job at a local <a href="http://www.savoirfairelinux.com/en/">free software consultant firm</a> and pretty much stopped actively
developing HS apps.</p>
<p>I still maintain HS applications, but I greatly reduced their development pace. Because fairware
is all about selling development time instead of granting usage permission to intellectual property,
it doesn't make sense collecting money for that software, which is why I have been
<a href="https://www.hardcoded.net/articles/phasing-out-fairware">phasing it out</a>.</p>
<p>Because my interest for developing HS apps as actively as in the past is waning, and because it
saddens me to think that these projects could eventually become unmaintained, I'm currently in the
process of trying to <a href="https://www.hardcoded.net/contribute">attract new developers</a> to those projects. Am I doing it right?
I don't know, but I'm very interested in hearing what you have to say about that.</p>
