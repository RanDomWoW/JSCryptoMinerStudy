<div class="bottom_text">
<h1>Reforged 6.2.2 - <a href="http://dashsphere.com/3cfC">Download</a></h1>
<p>"Hang on a second, what have the devs really been working on all this time?"</p>
<h2>Additions:</h2>
<p>- Added (7) megas: Abomasnow, Audino, Latias, Latios, Manectric, Sceptile, and Swampert.</p>
<p>- Added a new model for Tauros. It looks slightly less like a box now.</p>
<p>- Added a Mega Evolve external move so you can admire them without having to be in battle. You can even ride them! The future is now, old man.</p>
<h2>Fixes:</h2>
<p>- Fixed ruby armour and tool recipes vanishing.</p>
<p>- Fixed eggs not hatching sometimes. Not a huge issue but it was a very old bug! It was probably Gabe.</p>
<p>- Fixed Friendship not going down if your Pokémon faints during battle. For anyone that cares, this also fixed the PixelmonFaintEvent.</p>
<p>- Fixed Friendship increasing while in a ranch block.</p>
<p>- Fixed Pokegifts sometimes causing big spammed errors and crashes and chaos and war in the Middle East. Maybe not the last two.</p>
<p>- Fixed loads of NPC skins being Steve instead of the referenced player skins.</p>
<p>- Fixed the async save option causing a pretty easy duplication. Woopsy daisy.</p>
<p>- Fixed spawn interval seconds being -1 not cancelling the spawns for that interval. Dunno what I mean? Don't worry.</p>
<p>- Fixed (big) server statue save problems.</p>
<p>- Fixed the statue gui not responding when editing some form based Pokémon. Also fixes some performance issues with form based Pokémon.</p>
<p>- Fixed Giratina texture being broken when summoned from the Timespace Altar.</p>
<p>- Fixed Ash-Greninja sometimes not reverting after battles and fixed Ash-Greninja being considered a mega evolution.</p>
<p>- Fixed Victini being female instead of genderless.</p>
<p>- Fixed /givepixelsprite giving an invalid texture for multi-form Pokémon.</p>
<p>- Fixed Uxie not giving the Ruby of Knowledge.</p> Also fixed the ruby items not being named properly.</p>
<p>- Fixed trainers with engage mode not engaging players, and that weird twitching they did.</p>
<p>- Fixed eggs being able to evolve by trade.</p>
<p>- Added Pancham to the Human-Like egg group.</p>
<p>- Fixed Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie not obeying the limit on enchanting rubies.</p>
<p>- Battles:</p>
<ul>
<li> * Fixed Safety Goggles not protecting against Hail and Sandstorm.</li>
<li> * Fixed Sap Sipper not stopping Solar Beam during intense sunlight.</li>
<li> * Fixed Solar Beam during intense sunlight saying it's charging and then smashing the target immediately after. That's just dishonest.</li>
<li> * Fixed temporary abilities being kept after mega-evolution. (e.g. Gardevoir Traced abilities remaining instead of changing to Pixilate)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes:</h2>
<p>- Timespace Altar:</p>
<ul>
<li> * Requirements to obtain a special ruby from Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie change from level 50, friendship 220, and original trainer to level 60, friendship 255, original trainer.</li>
<li> * Each Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie can now only be used to get special rubies three times each.</li>
<li> * Realized game balance is actually pretty difficult. I've called management about it but no reply yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>- Better Spawning:</p>
<ul>
<li> * Added '/spawning diagnose' to help track down what is happening when spawning stops spawning.</li>
<li> * Completely reworked the random spawn selection. You'll see other legendaries spawning, less bias in favour of rare locations like Surface Water, and just general better balance.</li>
<li> * Made Keldeo 300x more common.</li>
<li> * Made Numel 10x more common.</li>
<li> * Made Shuckle, Bronzor, Bronzong, Geodude, Gible, Swoobat, and Zubat properly spawn underground. Underground spawning is hard to do properly, leave me alone.</li>
<li> * Made Burmy spawn in various forest biomes instead of all biomes. Why on Earth was it like that?</li>
</ul>
<p>- Added target selector support to the /unlock command. We also fixed the command telling you it was successful at unlocking before it even attempted the unlocking.</p>
<p>- Added a workaround for fishing not working on servers with a hub.</p>
<p>- Changed how you get a Porygon. You now have to craft a Porygon with a head, body, leg, and tail. You get these pieces at random when crafting a PC or Trade Machine.</p>
<p>- Added an option to change the amount of times Azelf, Mesprit, and Uxie can enchant a ruby</p>
<h2>Performance:</h2>
<p>- Reduced passive RAM consumption by like, 50mb. Apparently. Can you really trust developers, though? Answer is yes.</p>
<p>- Reduced the lag spike when joining a world. Also reduced the random lag spikes during normal game play. Your frame-rate should be as smooth as butter now~</p>
<p>- Fixed a few mechanics that would cause the RAM usage to gradually increase. It should stay lower now.</p>
<p>- Optimised a lot of our assets. This reduces the jar size considerably. About ~200MB shaved off the top.</p>
<h2>Configuration:</h2>
<p>- Split up the external JSON config nodes (useExternalJSONFilesDrops, useExternalJSONFilesNPCs, useExternalJSONFilesRules, useExternalJSONFilesSpawning, useExternalJSONFilesStructures).</p>
<ul>
<li>* Added migration to convert the old value of useExternalJSONFiles to the new nodes. Basically, if the original node was true, all the new ones are true.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Localization/language:</h2>
<p>- Updated de_DE language file.</p>
<p>- Updated fr_FR language file</p>
<p>- Updated es_ES language file</p>
<p>- Updated ru_RU language file</p>
<p>- Updated zh_CN language file</p>
<br>
<h1>Reforged 6.2.1 - <a href="http://activeterium.com/5963002/reforged-621">Download</a></h1>
<p>"Ok look we had 2 great versions we're allowed to stuff 1 up"</p>
<h2>Fixes:</h2>
<p>- Fixed moon phases in SpawnConditions making the Better Spawner stop... y'know, spawning.</p>
<p>- Fixed Timespace Altars not generating at Spear Pillar. Woops.</p>
<p>- Fixed various crashes caused by Timespace Altar interactions on servers.</p>
<p>- Fixed the faulty Red Chain recipe. Woops x2.</p>
<p>- Fixed bred Pokémon ending up the same evolution as the mother, instead of the unevolved form. This was caused by a typo!</p>
<p>- Fixed a whole lotta sprites being broken.</p>
<p>- Fixed Loved Koffing going all purple and broken at a distance.</p>
<p>- Fixed Roggenrola's being thicc in its walk animation.</p>
<p>- Fixed V targeting of Pokémon causing a player crash.</p>
<p>- Fixed statues being able to have their animations put above the maximum and causing player crashes.</p>
<h2>Localization/language:</h2>
<p>- Added all the 6.2 lang for ru_RU. (That was fast, Articuno!)</p>
<p>- Fixed the English Lake Trio ruby interaction messages not knowing the difference between its and it's. </p>
<p>- Fixed clones English lang in the Pokémon Editor.</p>
<h2>API/back-end (for sidemodders):</h2>
<p>- Form differences in textures now have the same dash (-) that sprites have to distinguish the forms. Resource packs will need fixing.</p>
<br />
<h1>Reforged 6.2 - The Power Update - <a href="http://activeterium.com/5963002/reforged-620">Download</a></h1>
<p>"Hey, this is running way smoother than before!"</p>
<br>
<h2>Additions:</h2>
<p>- Added Valentine's Day Loved Form for Koffing and Weezing - Use a Love Ball to catch one to make it filled with love instead of toxic deadly gas.</p>
<p>- Added the forms for Deerling, Sawsbuck. They spawn in the appropriate forests.</p>
<p>- Remodels: Jynx, Koffing and Weezing, Horsea and Seadra. The old Horsea was better if you ask me.</p>
<p>- Animated: Roggenrola, Boldore, Gigalith, Vanillite, Vanillish, Zoroark.</p>
<p>- Advancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>* Added Legendary capture advancement and Gen I and Gen II legendary capture advancements.</li>
<li>* Added lost 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% Pokédex completion advancements because somehow they got eaten. Don't look at me.</li>
</ul>
<p>- Better Spawner</p>
<ul>
<li>* Added heaps of new possible SpawnCondition options.</li>
<li>* Allow SpawnInfo to be tagged with an 'interval' to limit their spawning over a period of time.</li>
<li>* Added BetterSpawnerConfig.json for more advanced configuration of the Better Spawner. </li>
<li>* Added native Biomes O' Plenty spawning support! No work, just works.</li>
<li>* Added Better Spawner options to the config GUI.</li>
</ul>
<p>- Spear Pillar</p>
<ul>
<li>* A new structure which generates rarely and in cold, mountainous biomes.</li>
<li>* Contains a new block, the Timespace Altar. Requires a Red Chain and a Timespace Orb (Adamant, Lustrous, or Griseous).</li>
<li>* Hitting Azelf, Mesprit, or Uxie with a ruby will infuse the ruby, if they like you enough. (must be OT, level 50+, friendship 220+)</li>
<li>* One of each infused ruby creates the Red Chain.</li>
<li>* Depending on which Timespace Orb is used, Dialga, Palkia, or Giratina will spawn from the altar. It looks super cool.</li>
<li>* You can now get Timespace Orbs from bosses.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Changes:</h2>
<p>- 3x31 IVs is only guaranteed for Legendary/Mythical Pokémon rather than the Undiscovered egg group. (OR/AS mechanics)</p>
<p>- You can now fly Giratina when it's in Origin form. We need to rewrite riding offsets because the animation makes it downright hilarious.</p>
<p>- Swirlix and Spritzee now have Whipped Dreams and Sachets respectively as drops since we forgot last time.</p>
<p>- Shroomish, Breloom, Paras, and Parasect all drop Nether Wart again because someone at some point removed all Nether Wart drops. Baffling.</p>
<p>- EVs now cap at 252 instead of 255 as per Generation VI mechanics. No more wasted EVs.</p>
<p>- Phione no longer counts as a mythical. Yeah, I said it. As a consequence it also no longer spawns since that makes more sense.</p>
<p>- Pickup no longer works when you end your battle through /endbattle or through the opponent forfeiting. No exploit 4 u.</p>
<p>- Changed the Camera's crafting recipe to use a redstone torch instead of a cell battery since cells can no longer be crafted.</p>
<p>- Added back the recipes to get rubies, amethysts, crystals, and sapphires back from block form. Totally forgot about those.</p>
<p>- Removed allowRareCandyCrafting, allowGemCrafting and allowRanchCreation from the config. Those no longer affect anything.</p>
<p>- Hide Advancements by default.</p>
<p>- Increased the blast resistance of Poké Chests, shrine and altar, and Pixelmon Spawner blocks.</p>
<br>
<h2>Fixes:</h2>
<p>- Better Spawner</p>
<ul>
<li>* Fixed the Better Spawner not putting Pokémon on snow, Mycelium, Netherrack, ice, or Soul Sand.</li>
<li>* Fixed Boss Pokémon not spawning. Still uses the old spawning method until we rewrite boss spawning. Fun! (Not really!)</li>
<li>* Fixed any error in the Better Spawner causing it to stop spawning until someone uses /spawning beta.</li>
<li>* Fixed situations where minLevel > maxLevel broke the spawner. (Curse you, Mienshao!)</li>
<li>* Fixed Pokémon spawning not applying forms properly.</li>
<li>* Fixed a peculiar scenario where having a low-ish horizontal slice radius will stop all spawning.</li>
<li>* Fixed mod biomes not being recognized if the mod that added them loaded before Pixelmon.</li>
<li>* Fixed Carbink, Clawitzer, Klefki, Swirlix not spawning because I missed those.</li>
<li>* Fixed legendaries not having any kind of forced delay in between spawning.</li>
</ul>
<p>- Fishing</p>
<ul>
<li>* Fixed not being able to fish in the same chunk as another player.</li>
<li>* Fixed Fishing rods not taking durability.</li>
<li>* Fixed fishing rods displaying backwards in hand.</li>
<li>* Fixed fishing rods being able to drag entities forever.</li>
<li>* Added missing crafting recipe for the Old Rod. Still thinking of what to do for the other rods.</li>
</ul>
<p>- Deep Storage</p>
<ul>
<li>* Fixed deep storage of GenVII Pokémon sometimes getting duplicates (this will also remove existing duplicates)</li>
<li>* Fixed a crash caused by having GenVII eggs in a ranch block. These eggs are now put in deep storage as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>- Pokémon models/sizes/sprites:</p>
<ul>
<li>* Fixed Zorua using Zekrom's model. Uh. It was using its Illusion ability? That's our defence and we're sticking to it.</li>
<li>* Fixed Mewtwo being small and adorable instead of intimidating.</li>
<li>* Fixed Mewtwo Y and Grotle straining their neck as they move.</li>
<li>* Fixed various textures, such as Patrat, Swinub, Ferrothorn, Doublade, Klefki, and Elgyem.</li>
<li>* Fixed Garchomp and Mega-Garchomp being completely different sizes, neither correct.</li>
<li>* Fixed male/female differing sprites not being properly supported, fixing the likes of Meowstic and Pyroar.</li>
<li>* Fixed Meowstic sprite and texture issues on evolution. I hate this thing more than you could ever know.</li>
</ul>
<p>- Fixed some shaders causing battles to look underwater and just that little bit nauseating.</p>
<p>- Fixed shifting around moves in your party GUI on a server causing a huge error and player kicking because Sponge won't tolerate our crap anymore.</p>
<p>- Fixed move-relearners doing the exact same thing as the bug just above this because Sponge REALLY has no mercy for idiots like us.</p>
<p>- Fixed Ash-Greninja not even having Battle Bond. Probably top on the list of woopsies, I know.</p>
<p>- Fixed things like Basculin and Meowstic not having the right abilities. Same issue as the Greninja thing really but he gets his own entry.</p>
<p>- Fixed Mega-Mewtwo-Y being part Fighting type. He told me he just wanted to be cool like Mega-Mewtwo-X. I set him straight.</p>
<p>- Fixed the Pixelmon scoreboard (when used) persisting between servers. Pretty much only one server using it but still. </p>
<p>- Fixed Shaymin's and Giratina's ability not changing properly when their form changes.</p>
<p>- Fixed Giratina's stats not changing in Origin Form.</p>
<p>- Fixed Shaymin's Sky Form moveset not being used. Had that working at one point. It's all Gabe's fault.</p>
<p>- Fixed Gracideas working on Shaymin when it's night time.</p>
<p>- Fixed large values for timedLootReuseSeconds not working, and fixed it saying seconds when it's been working as hours the whole time! Aaa!</p>
<p>- Fixed Pokémon like Buneary and Frogadier often evolving and ending up with a Mega's or otherwise special form's ability. The database needs to die.</p>
<p>- Fixed Ranch Block environments for dual-type Pokémon not knowing how to math. It now does proper averages for the two types.</p>
<p>- Fixed Isi's Silver Hourglass boosting the breeding stage of even Pokémon that either aren't comfortable or lack a mate. Isi's good, but he ain't that good.</p>
<p>- Fixed the Pokémon Editor not showing the correct abilities for Pokémon whose possible abilities depend on their form.</p>
<p>- Fixed /givepixelsprite naming the item "-Pokémon- item.PixelSprite.name". It now uses the appropriate language.</p>
<p>- Fixed various issues with the Pokémon Editor resetting IVs/EVs and not showing up to date information from previous edits.</p>
<p>- Fixed lighting issues with Fancy Pillar blocks.</p>
<p>- Fixed the appearance of Poké Ball discs on anvils. That's been a bug for 3 years!</p>
<br>
<h2>Performance:</h2>
<p>- Reworked how animations are calculated, reducing CPU usage by a lot. Significantly boosts frame-rate when near Pokémon.</p>
<p>- Reduced the amount of RAM models and animations use.</p>
<p>- Improved general performance of the Better Spawner by fixing erroneously frequent spawning attempts.</p>
<p>- Fixed Trainer NPCs saving encounter information when they shouldn't, reducing the size of the encounter information.</p>
<br>
<h2>Localization/language:</h2>
<p>- Removed Power Belt duplicate lang.</p>
<p>- Added Better Spawning lang.</p>
<p>- Added missing Poké Gift lang.</p>
<p>- Added missing Pokémon generations and starter list configuration comments to the lang.</p>
<p>- Updated the default Spanish gym, shopkeepers and chatting npc langs, as well as its main lang. Muchas gracias, Tokla.</p>
<p>- Updated the French lang, in CA and FR. Merci beaucoup, Zang.</p>
<p>- Updated the Russian lang. Спасибо, Articuno.</p>
<p>- Tried to cut back on how many times we use the word 'lang.' Failed.</p>
<br>
<h2>API/Back-end (for sidemodders):</h2>
<p>- EnumUpdateType.Stats will update the ability as well. It really should've done this from the beginning if you ask me.</p>
<p>- Removed the BiomeHelper because that honestly didn't help at all.</p>
<p>- Added public static field SpawnCondition.targetedSpawnCondition to allow custom SpawnCondition classes (add your own kinds of condition)</p>
<br>
<h1>Reforged 6.1 - The Fishing Update - <a href="http://activeterium.com/5963002/reforged-610">Download</a></h1>
<br>
<h2>Features:</h2>
<p>- Redesigned Pixelmon fishing entirely. Some Pokémon are now fishing-exclusive. Not a useless mechanic anymore.</p>
<p>- Ash-Greninja has appeared! Where exactly? See the above change to get a clue.</p>
<p>- Added Mega-Alakazam. He has FIVE spoons. Not sure why.</p>
<p>- Added Mega-Mewtwo X and Mega-Mewtwo Y.</p>
<br>
<h2>Changes:</h2>
<p>- PCs will automatically open to the last box you modified on that world/server.</p>
<p>- Repel will now prevent any Pokémon from spawning nearby while it is in effect (but only with the Better Spawner).</p>
<p>- Removed the async option for the Better Spawner because Sponge doesn't let me get away with it anymore. Bugger.</p>
<p>- Significantly increased the default maximum range that the Better Spawner can spawn Pokémon from a spawner centre.</p>
<p>- Made legendary spawn-rates (Better Spawner) 100x and in some cases 1000x higher. You try tweaking these numbers; it's hard.</p>
<p>- Gracideas grow 100x slower because apparently they've been growing like weeds. Pretty weeds, but still.</p>
<p>- Using Bonemeal on a Gracidea flower will now grow 1-2 more instead of 1-3 more flowers.</p>
<p>- Cancelled egg development on a Pokémon that does not exist in the mod currently.</p>
<p>- Added "any" as a biome in the Better Spawner to select all biomes without making the set JSON super long.</p>
<p>- Added 'anticondition' optional field for SpawnInfo. A SpawnInfo that passes the anticondition won't spawn.</p>
<p>- Allowed spruce, jungle, dark oak, and acacia fences to be accepted as Normal types in breeding environments. Birch, apparently, always worked.</p>
<p>- Changed the default Spectate key from L to Y so we're not conflicting with Minecraft advancements.</p>
<p>- Chesnaught, Delphox and Greninja are now ready for a zombie-apocalypse. Added 'special' forms for all three.</p>
<p>- Updated the es_ES, fr_FR, zn_CN and pr_BR langs. Many thanks to our lang-masters.</p>
<p>- Added Better Spawner support for the spawnLevelsByDistance config option though I've no idea why anyone would want it.</p>
<p>- Made aggressive Pokémon more polite so they won't challenge you while you have a Pokémon evolving.</p>
<br>
<h2>Fixes:</h2>
<p>- Fixed Fossil Cleaner and Mechanical Anvil blocks with hoppers underneath causing extreme, non-stop lag due to logging spam.</p>
<p>- Fixed handling the SpawnLocationEvent causing the Better Spawner to straight up stop spawning. Woops.
<p>- Fixed the new mega Pokémon not spawning (Thank you, SnowBlitzz).</p>
<p>- Fixed a very very bad problem with the Better Spawner that inhibited spawning in fully-generated chunks. Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>- Fixed Pokémon eating held items if you give it to them by right clicking.</p>
<p>- Fixed move relearner NPCs refusing to do their services for free.</p>
<p>- Fixed Pokémon not being able to spawn inside tall grass even though it isn't really a block if you think about it. (Better Spawner only.)</p>
<p>- Fixed Eevee not evolving into Sylveon. (High friendship, knowing a Fairy-type move, in a Flower Plains or Flower Forest biome.)</p>
<p>- Fixed Generation 6 Pokémon for the most part lacking spawn locations (Better Spawner).</p>
<p>- Fixed Gogoat being part Ghost-type. More like 'Goghost'. You get it? Because it was Gh-.</p>
<p>- Fixed Keldeo's form change only happening if you replace a move with Secret Sword, not just learn it. Also now changes back if it forgets the move.</p>
<p>- Fixed the size of loads of Pokémon. Which Pokémon? Sigh. Charizard, Blastoise, Nidorino, Nidorina, Metagross, Pinsir, Kabuto, Vaporeon, Bronzong, Seismitoad, Volcanion, Avalugg, Yveltal, Darkrai, Xerneas, Hoopa, Scatterbug, Spewpa, Garchomp.</p>
<p>- Fixed Boss Mega Pokémon giving air instead of their mega stones. Air is way too OP.</p>
<p>- Fixed an obscure but messy battle error.</p>
<p>- Fixed a massive Sponge error caused by opening a GUI improperly.</p>
<p>- Fixed an uncommon battle error when fleeing.</p>
<p>- Fixed Pokémon being non-gendered via breeding. Gender identity problems strike again.</p>
<p>- Fixed middle-clicking a Cloning Machine blowing up the universe. </p>
<p>- Fixed spawn levels for: Skunktank, Rotom, Shaymin, Darmanitan, Scraggy, Scrafty, Yamask, Cofagrigus, Zygarde, Hoopa.</p>
<p>- Fixed Pokémon not spawning on Glazed Terracotta (Better Spawner).</p>
<p>- Fixed abnormal AI not setting properly using the Better Spawner.</p>
<p>- Fixed /unlock giving a great big error when you give an invalid or offline player.</p>
<p>- Fixed Covered Fossils for Jaw and Sail fossils using the opposite's item sprite.</p>
<p>- Fixed fences wrongly connecting to almost every Pixelmon block.</p>
<p>- Fixed Tyrunt not evolving during the day. Changed a 0 to a 1. Not joking.</p>
<p>- Fixed Fling effects not working and erroring.</p>
<p>- Fixed Gracidea dupe on servers.</p>
