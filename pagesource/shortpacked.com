<div id="middle"><div class="blogpost"><h2><a href="/blog.php?postid=916">An unfortunate abbreviation</a></h2><div class="publishtime">February 28, 2018 02:00 am</div><div class="cc-blogpost"><p><a href="/image/SSRatchet1.jpg"><img src="/image/SSRatchet1.jpg" width="300" height="249" align="left" alt="" /></a>The Transformers live-action movies are over a decade old now, so we&#039;re getting a new ... commemorative(?) toyline in Studio Series.&nbsp; It seems to be taking the place of last year&#039;s The Last Knight toyline on store shelves (you gotta maintain your retail footprint), and towards the end of the year it will eventually encompass toys related to December&#039;s Bumblebee The Movie or whatever its specific title is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Among Studio Series&#039; strengths, seen from a distance, is that it goes back and gives a few older characters newer, better, more appropriately-sized toys.&nbsp; A Leader Class-sized Blackout, for example.&nbsp; A new Leader-Class-sized Grimlock that&#039;s actually based on his finalized screen appearance and isn&#039;t a half-chromed awkward curiosity.&nbsp; A Revenge of the Fallen Megatron that&#039;s not bizarrely teal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Another strength is that... extraordinary lengths (for Hasbro) have been traversed to make each toy roughly in scale with the rest of the line while in robot mode.&nbsp; That means that despite Bumblebee and Ratchet both being Deluxe Class toys, Bumblebee is a very small Deluxe and Ratchet is more on the large size.&nbsp; So, bravely, Hasbro is trying to sell some smaller toys at us for the same price as the bigger dudes, but altogether, the <strong><a href="http://news.tfw2005.com/2018/02/19/transformers-movie-studio-series-hand-images-359652">toyline will look nice standing up in a row.</a></strong></p><p>(also there&#039;s a cardboard display thingy inside)</p><p><a href="/image/SSRatchetandTBRatchet.jpg"><img src="/image/SSRatchetandTBRatchet.jpg" width="250" height="188" align="right" alt="" /></a></p><p>Weaknesses?&nbsp; Let&#039;s talk about <strong><a href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Ratchet_(Movie)">Ratchet.&nbsp;</a></strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Ratchet is a completely new toy, though he transforms pretty similarly to the last Ratchet toy, the Deluxe Class Dark of the Moon version, which was recently done up in fancy paints by Takara in their &quot;Transformers Movie The Best&quot; line.&nbsp; Studio Series Ratchet does not compare favorably to The Best Ratchet in the paint department.&nbsp; There are some areas that TB Ratchet underperforms, to be sure -- he has no shin paint, for example, nor are his flashers painted -- but overall, TB Ratchet just looks better than SS Ratchet.&nbsp; Actual movie CGI Ratchet&#039;s face is more gunmetal than green, but SS Ratchet&#039;s head is mostly unpainted green plastic, and the likeness strongly suffers for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Studio Series Ratchet also has trouble staying together in vehicle mode.&nbsp; His roof railing stuff is rubbery plastic, and it has trouble laying flat across the roof, even though there are pegs to plug in.&nbsp; It just wants to bend outwardly.&nbsp; (Also, since it is one long rubber piece, it hangs off his back like a cape, rather than being able to be folded up and tucked away.)&nbsp; Additionally, the panels on the sides of the vehicle which are formed from his shins have trouble staying pegged in, and they like to puff out.&nbsp; It is very annoying!</p><p><a href="/image/SSRatchet2.jpg"><img src="/image/SSRatchet2.jpg" width="250" height="183" align="left" alt="" /></a></p><p>Things that are better about him?&nbsp; I love that the light and piping stuff is finally included on his shoulders.&nbsp; In recent Ratchets, they were fine with just leaving his wheels up there unadorned, but on Studio Series Ratchet you can rotate the wheels around in robot mode to display his proper kibble.&nbsp; I also like that his buzzsaw weapon is included.&nbsp; It&#039;d been a while.&nbsp; And, yeah, it&#039;s appealing that he&#039;s a larger Deluxe than usual.&nbsp; Plus he&#039;s a very bright green!&nbsp; Movie Ratchets are often a desaturated yellow or a gross pea green, but this one is properly sunny-looking.</p><p>I bought him because I like Ratchets, and this was a completely new tooling.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard to strongly recommend him otherwise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div style="clear:both"></div><p>Tagged: <a href="searchblog.php?search=ratchet">ratchet</a>, <a href="searchblog.php?search=studio series">studio series</a></p></div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="cc-commentlink"><a href="/blog.php?postid=916#disqus_thread" data-disqus-identifier="2-916">Comments</a> | <a href="/blog.php?postid=916#addcomment">Add Comment</a></div></div><p><hr /></p><div class="blogpost"><h2><a href="/blog.php?postid=915">I want it so bad I can taste it</a></h2><div class="publishtime">February 23, 2018 10:30 pm</div><div class="cc-blogpost"><p><a href="/image/Hun-Gurrr1.jpg"><img src="/image/Hun-Gurrr1.jpg" width="250" height="286" align="left" alt="" /></a><strong><a href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Hun-Gurrr_(G1)">Hun-Gurrr</a></strong> is Elita One&#039;s casemate, and if local Walmarts are any indication, much more popular!&nbsp; I mean, I guess <strong><a href="http://www.shortpacked.com/blog.php?postid=914">unlike Elita One</a></strong> he&#039;s a completely new mold (though he transforms similarly to <strong><a href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Silverbolt_(G1)#Combiner_Wars"><em>Combiner Wars</em> Silverbolt</a></strong>), so he&#039;s got that going for him.&nbsp; And, like, I know, I had Hun-Gurrr/Grrr/Gur when I was a kid, and so that lure of nostalgia is there.&nbsp; But c&#039;mon.&nbsp; Elita One, you guys.&nbsp; She&#039;ll punch your face so hard her arms need smokestacks.</p><p>Not to say that Hun-Gurrr is terrible or anything.&nbsp; He&#039;s all right!&nbsp; Which is... honestly kind of a damning thing to say, since the <strong><a href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Hun-Gurrr_(G1)#Generation_1">original 1988 version</a></strong> is probably the best combiner torso there was.&nbsp; That dude had crazy articulation, man, for 1988.&nbsp; 1988 Hun-Gurrr established a pretty high bar for 2018 Hun-Gurrr to clear.&nbsp; And in some ways he does, and in some ways he doesn&#039;t.</p><p>First off, you notice that the rear legs of the beast mode are backwards-elbowed.&nbsp; It&#039;s kind of necessary for how the torso mode thighs form, but it still looks awkard.&nbsp; Second-off, you notice the big mass of purple hanging under his stomach.&nbsp; That&#039;s both good and bad -- Good, because it&#039;s fun to integrate combiner mode kibble into the main toy rather than having to attach it later, and Bad because it wasn&#039;t actually integrated very well here.&nbsp; It just hangs off his stomach.&nbsp; It&#039;s less bad in person, and you&#039;re more likely to notice how the deco purposefully tapers off between the parts and the dragon mode on his stomach so you can see a purposeful dragon shape under there, but, uh, yeah.</p><p><a href="/image/Hun-Gurrr2.jpg"><img src="/image/Hun-Gurrr2.jpg" width="300" height="185" align="right" alt="" /></a>The ways he does better, though?&nbsp; They&#039;re pretty good ways!&nbsp; The original Hun-Gurrr didn&#039;t have beast mode mouths that opened.&nbsp; This is pretty ridiculous for a robot friggin&#039; named &quot;Hunger.&quot;&nbsp; Dude can&#039;t eat!&nbsp; But the new toy does have openable mouths.&nbsp; The new toy also has side-to-side dragon head articulation (or ankle tilting in robot mode), and this plus the mouths... is everything.&nbsp; The original 1988 toy was unusually dynamic, but the new one is just a little moreso because of the addtional head articulation.&nbsp;</p><p>Otherwise, y&#039;know, it&#039;s Hun-Gurrr again.&nbsp; He&#039;s good, but he&#039;s no Elita One.</p><p>(i&#039;ll wait to talk about the combined mode once his limbs come out)</p><div style="clear:both"></div><p>Tagged: <a href="searchblog.php?search=hun-gurrr">hun-gurrr</a>, <a href="searchblog.php?search=power of the primes">power of the primes</a>, <a href="searchblog.php?search=generations">generations</a></p></div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="cc-commentlink"><a href="/blog.php?postid=915#disqus_thread" data-disqus-identifier="2-915">Comments</a> | <a href="/blog.php?postid=915#addcomment">Add Comment</a></div></div><p><hr /></p><div class="blogpost"><h2><a href="/blog.php?postid=914">Best First</a></h2><div class="publishtime">February 20, 2018 12:20 am</div><div class="cc-blogpost"><p><a href="/image/Elita1POTP1.jpg"><img src="/image/Elita1POTP1.jpg" width="200" height="289" align="left" alt="" /></a>Here it is!&nbsp; The toy I was most anticipating in the entire&nbsp;<em>Power of the Primes</em>&nbsp;lineup.&nbsp; And I know it&#039;s the one I would most anticipate because Hasbro retailer presentation slides of the whole gaddang line were leaked months ago.&nbsp; At the time, we thought, whoops, the first half of the line got leaked!&nbsp; Ha ha, no, that was the actual whole thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Power of the Primes&nbsp;</em>is apparently pretty short, capping out at wave 4 instead of wave 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But, like, yeah, a sizeable&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Elita_One_(G1)">Elita One</a></strong>&nbsp;has been on my wish list for years.&nbsp; I never thought we&#039;d get one.&nbsp; Hasbro doesn&#039;t tend to make Transformer women larger than Deluxe.&nbsp; In 1999, we got a Mega (today&#039;s Voyager)&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Blackarachnia_(BW)/toys#TM2">Transmetal 2 Blackarachnia</a></strong>, and since then we&#039;ve got... well,&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Victorion">Victorion</a></strong>, the 6-member combiner team we voted on and made Hasbro produce.&nbsp; So my confidence in $25-$30 lady robot seemed like a pipe dream.</p><p>Because Elita One should be big and stompy.&nbsp; She&#039;s Elita One, dammit.&nbsp; Her name means the same thing that Optimus Prime&#039;s does.&nbsp; She should be his equal.&nbsp; Like, a big truck thing, and she should look like she could crush you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But I will also allow &quot;big jet thing.&quot;</p><p><a href="/image/Elita1POTP2.jpg"><img src="/image/Elita1POTP2.jpg" width="250" height="204" align="right" alt="" /></a>Power of the Primes Elita-1 (why do they keep spelling it like that) is a massive retool of POTP Starscream.&nbsp; She&#039;s got an entirely different robot mode (well the biceps are the same), some new wingtips, and mostly the same jet mode.&nbsp; That&#039;s a lotta retooling.&nbsp; The toy otherwise operates and transforms exactly the same.&nbsp; Which is fine, because&nbsp;<a href="http://www.shortpacked.com/blog.php?postid=909"><strong>I really like POTP Starscream</strong></a>.&nbsp; The only thing I dislike about him are the...stickers.</p><p>Ugh, Elita One&#039;s stickers.&nbsp; Like Starscream, she has them covering the full surface of her wings.&nbsp; I will try to keep them, if only because they add more pink to her color scheme, and pink is very important.&nbsp; If&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.reprolabels.com">Reprolabels</a></strong>&nbsp;comes up with replacement stickers that have equal or more amounts of pink, then that is what will happen.</p><p><a href="/image/ElitaINFIN1TE.jpg"><img src="/image/ElitaINFIN1TE.jpg" width="200" height="201" align="left" alt="" /></a><em>or these will fray and peel from even minimal use like these stickers tend to and i&#039;ll have to yank &#039;em off regardless, who knows</em></p><p>Elita One is not quite the giant pink jet I was hoping for, if only &#039;cuz her color scheme skews towards red.&nbsp; It&#039;s an... almost pink dark red she has over most of her body, with a salmony color for accents.&nbsp; These plus the white and black result in a very striking color scheme, so it&#039;s not, like, terrible that she&#039;s not more pink.&nbsp; I prefer pink and also pink of the cartoon, but she still looks great.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Like Starscream, she forms the torso of a combiner robot.&nbsp; Unlike Starscream, we got the name for her combined form at Toy Fair.&nbsp; It&#039;s Elita Infin1te, with the 1.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if I love or hate this.&nbsp; I may never know.&nbsp; It&#039;s an ongoing, mercurial process of acceptance and groaning.</p><div style="clear:both"></div><p>Tagged: <a href="searchblog.php?search=elita one">elita one</a>, <a href="searchblog.php?search=power of the primes">power of the primes</a>, <a href="searchblog.php?search=generations">generations</a></p></div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="cc-commentlink"><a href="/blog.php?postid=914#disqus_thread" data-disqus-identifier="2-914">Comments</a> | <a href="/blog.php?postid=914#addcomment">Add Comment</a></div></div><p><hr /></p><div class="blogpost"><h2><a href="/blog.php?postid=913">EEEEAGLE!</a></h2><div class="publishtime">February 14, 2018 11:30 pm</div><div class="cc-blogpost"><p><a href="/image/POTP-Battletrap1.jpg"><img src="/image/POTP-Battletrap1.jpg" width="200" height="251" align="left" alt="" /></a>Everything old is new again, but with joints!&nbsp; EVERYTHING.&nbsp; Back in the day (1987), there were this pair of Decepticons called <strong><a href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Duocon">Duocons</a></strong> because they were singular robots who each formed out of two separate vehicles.&nbsp; The individual vehicles didn&#039;t do anything themselves other than form half a robot.&nbsp; It&#039;s like, y&#039;know, Overlord or a backwards Sky Lynx.&nbsp; <strong><a href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Battletrap">Battletrap</a></strong> was one of those Duocons, and he was a robot formed from a helicopter humping an SUV.</p><p><em>*freeze frame, zip-fast-forward through 30 years, slight pause at BotCon 2015 to say &quot;huh&quot; at the Springer redeco, finish zip-fast-forward, abrupt stop in 2018, record scratch*</em></p><p>Anyway, now each of Battletrap&#039;s two vehicle components are their own guys!&nbsp; Battletrap is now formed from <strong><a href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Battleslash">Battleslash</a></strong> the helicopter and <strong><a href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Roadtrap">Roadtrap</a></strong> the SUV, each turns into a robot, and they&#039;re sold separately.</p><p>I like to think they&#039;re married and that the combined form Battletrap is their child.&nbsp; Like, you know, one of them is J.D. and the other one is Turk, and J.D. hops on Turk and instead of running around yelling &quot;EEEAGLE!&quot; they are a consolidated robotical form.&nbsp; The World&#039;s Most Giant Doctor.</p><p><a href="/image/POTP-Battletrap2.jpg"><img src="/image/POTP-Battletrap2.jpg" width="250" height="98" align="right" alt="" /></a>I am in awe of the complexity involved in these toys.&nbsp; Like, the other Legends Class toys are.... fairly simple.&nbsp; They&#039;re all Windchargers and Brawns, who transform the usual Transformers way of rotating out the legs and pulling out the arms and being done after three steps.&nbsp; But each of these two guys, Battleslash and Roadtrap, have a lot going on.&nbsp; A lot of pieces going on.&nbsp; I wonder how they budgeted this.&nbsp; (probably by making the other guys Windchargers and Brawns)</p><p>Both guys have enough parts to not only form individually-articulated robots but also a fully-articulated combined robot form.&nbsp; Heck, Battletrap&#039;s kind of got an ab crunch, even.&nbsp; It&#039;s kind of nuts.&nbsp; Yeah, a lot of the articulation doubles up -- Battleslash&#039;s neck joint is Battletrap&#039;s waist joint, for example -- but it&#039;s all still very impressive.</p><p><a href="/image/POTP-Battletrap3.jpg"><img src="/image/POTP-Battletrap3.jpg" width="250" height="172" align="left" alt="" /></a></p><p>Well, okay, the vehicle modes are probably the weak link.&nbsp; Both are vehicle-ish shaped blobs.&nbsp; Roadtrap&#039;s SUV form is very obviously 50% a robot mode chest.&nbsp; Battleslash&#039;s helicopter mode is obviously a bunch of wadded up robot parts.</p><p>Despite that, these two toys are very easy to recommend.&nbsp; There&#039;s going to be some kids out there who only have one or the other (I don&#039;t think it mentions the combining aspect on the packaging, only in the instructions) and... I think their purchase will be good enough, really, without the other half, but these two really are a pair.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It&#039;s guy love between two guys.</p><div style="clear:both"></div><p>Tagged: <a href="searchblog.php?search=generations">generations</a>, <a href="searchblog.php?search=power of the primes">power of the primes</a>, <a href="searchblog.php?search=battletrap">battletrap</a>, <a href="searchblog.php?search=roadtrap">roadtrap</a>, <a href="searchblog.php?search=battleslash">battleslash</a></p></div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="cc-commentlink"><a href="/blog.php?postid=913#disqus_thread" data-disqus-identifier="2-913">Comments</a> | <a href="/blog.php?postid=913#addcomment">Add Comment</a></div></div><p><hr /></p><div class="blogpost"><h2><a href="/blog.php?postid=912">Bend over and hold this wheel</a></h2><div class="publishtime">January 23, 2018 12:35 am</div><div class="cc-blogpost"><p><a href="/image/CyKill3.jpg"><img src="/image/CyKill3.jpg" width="200" height="272" align="left" alt="" /></a>&nbsp;When Action Toys first got the license to make Machine Robo&nbsp;toys, I figured some toy-accurate recreations of old Machine Robo stuff was the closest we&#39;d ever get to new GoBots.&nbsp; Heck, we&#39;d heard that Action Toys specifically got the license to stuff that appeared in the&nbsp;<em>Revenge of Cronos</em>&nbsp;anime, and that animation didn&#39;t even feature prominently a lot of the guys we&#39;d recognize most readily from&nbsp;<em>Challenge of the GoBots</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>(GoBots rights are complicated, yo.&nbsp; Hasbro bought Tonka long ago, but do they own the animation now?&nbsp; Does Hanna-Barbara?&nbsp; Does Bandai still own the original toy likenesses???)</p><p>And so a while back I got this tiny little Bike Robo (pictured&nbsp;below), who&#39;s kind of like Cy-Kill if Cy-Kill had a normal regular boring robot face.&nbsp; No five-o-clock shadow, no yellow teeth -- I mean, those are the main draws, obviously, but with GoBots rights being such a quagmire, I figured it was the closest possible deal.</p><p><a href="/image/CyKill2.jpg"><img src="/image/CyKill2.jpg" width="250" height="263" align="right" alt="" /></a>Fastforward to a BIKE ROBO DELUXE being announced by Action Toys, and oh hey what what it has extra Cy-Kill faces you can swap in what the holy fudge.&nbsp; Can they do that?&nbsp; Hell, I&#39;m not sure they DID do that.&nbsp; The one I ordered I had shipped taken out of its package so that it could fit into a smaller box for international shipping, but I&#39;ve read that folks who had theirs shipped unopened had the extra Cy-Kill faces sent outside the packaging in a baggie.&nbsp; So maybe Action Toys is just skirting the terms of their license by offering FREE FACES WITH PURCHASE or whatever.&nbsp; Iunno.</p><p>But the point is, I bought the heck out of it, because Actual Cy-Kill With Five-O&#39;Clock Shadow is a thing I have to have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As I said, he&#39;s BIKE ROBO DELUXE, which means he&#39;s large.&nbsp; Well, larger than the other Action Toys Bike Robo, at least.&nbsp; Relatively large.&nbsp; He&#39;s kind of a Transformers Voyager or, more accurately, the size and bulk of aTransformers Masterpiece Autobot Car.&nbsp; He sees eye-to-eye with MP Prowl or Sideswipe and has a similar heft.&nbsp; (His ... chest is die-cast metal, I think?&nbsp; Something in the torso.)</p><p><a href="/image/CyKill1.jpg"><img src="/image/CyKill1.jpg" width="250" height="164" align="left" alt="" /></a>The other first thing you notice is that he comes with a&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://twitter.com/damnyouwillis/status/954466228650807297">little printed sheet that tells you which parts not to turn a certain way or they&#39;ll break</a></strong>.&nbsp; GOOD TO KNOW, I GUESS.&nbsp; You both want to see that first and not want to see that first.&nbsp; This is not your typical mass-market Transformer where they see how long it survives with a five-year-old before putting it in stores.</p><p>Otherwise, he seems to be a pretty solid guy.&nbsp; I&#39;m careful with him, because, again, he&#39;s not a Hasbro toy so I don&#39;t know what I should expect durability-wise, but nothing seems like it&#39;s on the verge of breaking.&nbsp; His transformation involves bending him over into a crouch while undoing all the teeny tiny details along the way that make him into a more pleasing Cy-Kill-esque robot.&nbsp; Both his wheels partsform, but they kind of have to if you want to keep both modes&#39; accuracy.&nbsp; They attach with magnets, which is neat.&nbsp; I mean, they also peg in, but mostly it&#39;s the magnets keeping them there rather than friction.&nbsp; The tires are rubber.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="/image/CyKill4.jpg"><img src="/image/CyKill4.jpg" width="200" height="183" align="right" alt="" /></a>Also there&#39;s a white panel to replace the face panels in motorcycle mode.&nbsp; I&#39;m happy keeping the Cy-Kill face in there, though, &#39;cuz that&#39;s how Cy-Kill rolls.&nbsp; Literally.</p><p>The only frightening part about the transformation is when you gotta push his legs together for cycle mode.&nbsp; There&#39;s a diagonal cut through his thighs, and that&#39;s the joint that The Paperwork tells you will break if you don&#39;t move it correctly, and so making sure you&#39;re doing the thing you&#39;re supposed to do and not the thing you&#39;re not supposed to do is a few moments of anxiety.&nbsp; Apparently The Paperwork just doesn&#39;t want you to think that&#39;s a rotational joint!&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d have tried to rotate it there without the warning, but I&#39;m sure as heck not gonna try it now, so mission objective achieved, I guess.</p><p><a href="/image/CyKill5.jpg"><img src="/image/CyKill5.jpg" width="300" height="391" align="left" alt="" /></a>Bike Robo/Cy-Kill is pleasingly articulated at about the same level that current Transformers Masterpieces are.&nbsp; Hell, I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s just supposed to be a Masterpiece-style Cy-Kill.&nbsp; He has double-jointed elbows and his fingers and thumb are somehow articulated even though they&#39;re big cylinders.&nbsp; (He has actual unarticulated big cylinders to replace his fists with if you prefer.)&nbsp; He&#39;s got a waist and an ab crunch and his head turns and, yeah, he does stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My only regret is that his head assembly doesn&#39;t bend up in motorcycle mode so he can <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/damnyouwillis/status/955009269895782400">look where he drives like in the cartoon</a></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He also comes with some flame attack parts you can peg into his wrists, if you want him to be shooting stuff or whatever.</p><p>He&#39;s got three Cy-Kill faces: neutral, smug grin, and&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://twitter.com/damnyouwillis/status/955006598375714816">frustrated</a></strong>. (linked &#39;cuz my lighting studio photos of his frustrated face were all blurry)&nbsp; I prefer the frustrated face &#39;cuz you can see his yellow teeth.&nbsp; Those yellow teeth are important.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I only put in the Bike Robo face for a review photograph.&nbsp; Probably not using it again.</p><p>I have never inserted the blank white motorcycle mode panel.&nbsp; I likely never will.</p><p>Everything else is pretty amazing, though.&nbsp; He makes me so happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div style="clear:both"></div><p>Tagged: <a href="searchblog.php?search=machine robo">machine robo</a>, <a href="searchblog.php?search=gobots">gobots</a>, <a href="searchblog.php?search=cykill">cykill</a>, <a href="searchblog.php?search=bike robo">bike robo</a></p></div><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="cc-commentlink"><a href="/blog.php?postid=912#disqus_thread" data-disqus-identifier="2-912">Comments</a> | <a href="/blog.php?postid=912#addcomment">Add Comment</a></div></div><p>Page 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/blog.php?dp=2">2</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/blog.php?dp=3">3</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/blog.php?dp=4">4</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/blog.php?dp=5">5</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/blog.php?dp=184">...</a></p>	<script type="text/javascript">
