<textarea id="stickynotification" style="display: none;">Right now, "adding content" means were are working on the site's videos library. We are removing most of the blurry videos uploaded between 2010 and 2014. Sorry if you liked those. 

The good news is, we will be uploaded similar videos which are much clearer. Our technology to clear older videos has improved greatly. They will be better, but not perfect.

Thanks for your understanding.

			<p style="display:none;" id="news_content_0">een — number one.”For more than 20 years, RuPaul has been the face of drag in America. In the early ‘90s, the nation’s curiosity was piqued by the 6-foot-4-inch man who strutted around unapologetically in outrageous dresses, dazzling blonde wigs, and thigh-high boots — the same man who coined the famous phrase, “You’re born naked and the rest is drag.” RuPaul wiggled his way into the public consciousness with hits like “Supermodel” and “Snapshot,” became the face of a high-profile MAC cosmetics campaign, and even briefly helmed a talk show, The RuPaul Show, in the mid ‘90s.But it was RuPaul’s Drag Race, the Emmy award–winning show, that truly brought drag culture — and, with it, RuPaul — out from gay bars and ballrooms and into people’s living rooms.The show, soon to begin its 10th season but currently airing its third season of the All Stars iteration, may have begun as a wry parody of America’s Next Top Model, but it’s since evolved into a pop culture smash embraced not only by the </p>

 Even before the butt-grabbing incident, James Tepperwien said his colleague Vito Messina had come onto him at least three times.

Tepperwien considers himself a "man&#39;s man," but as much as he wanted to hit Messina, he assumed any physical fight between men holding loaded guns would make the situation far worse.Then on Nov. 10, 2004, Tepperwien said, Messina came up from behind and aggressively grabbed his buttocks, driving his fingernails into Tepperwien&#39;s rear end. Tepperwien confided in another colleague, who told him that Messina had once tried to mount him on a desk. That prompted Tepperwien to speak to human resources the next day, he said in a 2007 deposition."All I&#39;d like to do is come in here and do my job and go home safe every day," Tepperwien told HR, according to deposition transcripts. "I know I&#39;m not the only guy he assaulted. I want to be the last guy." But the following year, Tepperwien said Messina made yet another unwanted sexual advance, and in the years since, at least eight more men have alleged that Messina g</p>

I had religiously watched Seasons 1–4 of RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race in secret from inside the closet, and from listening to the queens bicker while they drank cocktails, I learned that a queen just starting out sought out a mother to teach her her skills. So, newly out and proud, I found myself in the chair of a makeup artist to whom a friend had referred me: a giant, shit-talking, off-duty blonde drag queen named Sweetie.Sweetie had pounds of mascara and permanently limp wrists, and was exactly the kind of gay who&#39;d make my mom grasp my hand and pick up our pace when I was younger, were we to cross paths at the mall. As she painted huge shimmery eyelids on me, she gabbed about her life in New York, about RuPaul “before she was rich,” and the parties of the ’90s. She refused to teach me to glue down my eyebrows like I&#39;d seen the girls on Drag Race do. By the time she got to my lips, I realized I was in the pres</p>

			<p style="display:none;" id="news_content_4">x’s new fictional series about a group of high schoolers growing up in 1990s Oregon, working on the show has felt like a milestone in LGBT representation given its exploration of a young, lesbian romance.“The entire show defies stereotypes,” Peyton Kennedy, who plays the role of Kate Messner, told BuzzFeed News. “There’s so little representation in regular mainstream media that it’s incredible to be able to convey so much in one show.”Everything Sucks! is as much of a coming-out story as it is a coming-of-age story for Messner, one of the show’s main characters. The 10-episode season, which first premiered on Netflix on Feb. 16, shows Kate navigating her sexuality and realizing that she doesn’t actually have romantic feelings for her boyfriend, Luke O&#39;Neil (Jahi Di&#39;Allo Winston), because she likes girls instead.Kennedy said this is groundbreaking because while Everything Sucks! isn’t the first TV series to depict LGBT teens, she noted that there haven&#39;t been a lot of young</p>

Two or three times before I officially came out even to myself, I switched my Tinder over to show me women. At first I set it up to ... <!-- <br /> --> <a href="#" onclick="showhide_field('news_content_5');return false;">Show more</a></p>
			<p style="display:none;" id="news_content_5"> it up to show me both men and women, but I soon realized that this was more or less the same as having it show me only men, because there are way, way more straight men on Tinder than queer women. I would have to swipe through, like, fifty guys to see even one girl. And because the whole reason I’d made the switch in the first place was that I was still trying to evaluate whether I was actually interested in women or merely wished that I was, it was women I wanted to focus on. So I made my Tinder gay. That first time, I didn’t really want to match with anyone—I just wanted to see the girls that were on there, and to see how it felt to be there as someone looking for women. It was an experiment. I swiped left on women for ten or fifteen minutes, relieved not to feel anything more toward them than I did the men I passed over the same way.But then a profile came up which made me pause. It belonged to a girl around my age, wearing a leather jacket and a beanie over shoulder-length brown </p>

The criticism began when Cunard Line, which runs the Queen Mary 2 (pictured on left), the world’s largest ocean liner, told a gay couple who had cancelled their trip in protest that they would not receive a refund on their deposit – and ignored calls to register the ship elsewhere and change its flag. <br/><br/>

The Queen Mary 2, a totem of maritime grandeur, is the flagship vessel in Cunard’s luxury fleet. The British-American cruise line has, since 2011, registered its ships in Bermuda. <br/><br/>

Companies registered in this British overseas territory do not have to pay corporation tax. But registering a ship to any jurisdiction or country means abiding by its laws, flying its flag, and paying a fee to its authorities. Cunard did not respond when asked by GayTies whether it is registered in Bermuda for tax purposes. <br/><br/>

Since Bermuda introduced same-sex marriages in May 2017, the Queen Mary 2 has hosted gay weddings on board and, according to a company representative, Cunard employees are “proud to be strong supporters of the LGBT community.” <br/><br/>

But following the revocation of same-sex marriage last week, customer Jamison Firestone – who had booked a transatlantic crossing on the liner for him and his husband – emailed Cunard calling on it to register elsewhere and asking for his £600 deposit back. <br/><br/>

 “I simply do not feel comfortable taking a cruise on a ship registered in a jurisdiction that does not accept my marriage,” he wrote. But the company ignored his plea to re-flag and re-register the vessel in solidarity with the LGBT community and refused to give his money back. <br/><br/>

A Cunard employee told him via email that the company was unable to refund him “due solely to any personal opinion of the independent laws of Bermuda” and because “a cancellation for this particular reason would not constitute a significant alteration to the package as booked.” <br/><br/>

Firestone, a human rights lawyer from London, told GayTies that in fact this did represent a significant alteration of what he booked. “When I made the booking I thought, ‘It’s Cunard, the boat is named after a queen of England, it’s a quintessentially British experience.’ It is supposed to buy into British values or basic values of human rights,” he said, adding that he was unaware at the time of booking where the fleet was legally registered. It did not used to fly the Bermudan flag and was, said Firestone, “a symbol of Britishness for a long time.” <br/><br/>

“Then I read in the newspaper that Bermuda had revoked same-sex marriage and that all ships flying its flag would no longer be able to provide weddings, including the Cunard ships. I thought, ‘That’s not what I signed up for. My romantic experience isn’t supposed to be sailing on some ship registered to a jurisdiction that has just decided that people like me shouldn’t be married.’” <br/><br/>

The trip was, he said, a once-in-a-lifetime experience for him and his new husband, sailing from New York back to Britain after his husband’s daughter’s graduation in the States. The total cost of the tickets was just under £4,000, but as well as cancelling the trip, he thought Cunard would understand the predicament facing him and his husband and also return the deposit. <br/><br/>

“Back in the days of the civil rights movement, people stopped paying for public transport because they didn’t want their money going to segregation. And I don’t want to pay for this,” he said. “What if they had banned interracial marriages? Would I stay on a ship from a country flying that flag? No.” <br/><br/>

In his correspondence with the company, seen by BuzzFeed News, Firestone also asked Cunard to oppose change to the same-sex marriage law by removing its fleet from Bermuda – and the flag with it. As well as the Queen Mary 2, Cunard owns the Queen Elizabeth and Queen Victoria cruise ships. Its headquarters are in Southampton, England. <br/><br/>

Cunard is in turn owned by the multibillion-dollar Carnival Corporation &amp; plc – the largest leisure travel company in the world. It has 10 cruise line brands including P&amp;O, which has eight ships registered to Bermuda, and Princess, which has 13 ships registered in the jurisdiction. Bermuda is heavily dependent on tourism, and earns tens of thousands of dollars annually for each ship registered there.<br/><br/>

Of course, ANY member can go into the chat rooms at ANY time; it's a free gay chat room service. You do not have to be a premium member to use it. All you do is go into chat by clicking on the “Chat” link in the green header. As soon as you click to enter the chat room, that link changes to a red flashing “Chatting Now.” This is so everyone will know you are in there and they can enter also, if they wish. The book icon you see at the bottom of the chat window explains the simple features about chatting. <br><br>
There are three popular ways to start a chat: <br><br>
1. The first is spontaneous. Whenever you see the flashing “Chatting Now,” go in there. <br><br>
2. Another good way is to arrange it. If you want to chat with someone you see on line, message them to meet you in chat, either right then, or a set a pre-arranged time later. You can also message someone who is not on line, and set a pre-arranged time to meet in chat. Some members will use our personal Ads to meet guys for chat. <br><br>
3. The other way is to start an international group chat. Here is how to do that. <br><br>
Here are the 3 steps to start an online chat group session: <br><br>
First click on “Last 100 logins” green link on the home page and scroll through the profiles to see who is currently online. <br><br>
Second, type out (or copy and paste) a short invite such as: “I am creating a group chat session in 5 minutes, please click on 'Chat Rooms' and meet us there.” <br><br>
Third, send this message to ALL those gay chat lovers currently “on line” who selected “Cyber / chat buddies” as one of their interests.” Usually you see about a couple dozen members who are currently on line, AND interested in chat. Use the "Send message" link under each member's photo and simply paste that message invite, and send it. <br><br>
Do this sort of quickly so everyone gets the invite within a few minutes or so. In group chats, do not get selective. Message everyone you see online. <br><br> 
And …. that’s it. You are done. Chat with any of them, or let them chat with each other. It may be helpful for you to explain some features of chat, while you are in chat. <br><br>
We suggest that before you send out your group invites, go into the chat room first and click on everything. Get a little bit familiar with the rooms, how to have private “whisper” chats, and especially click on the book icon, which contains very simple chat instructions. <br><br>
It is not critical, but the rooms are for different subjects of chat. People can chat in the Lobby, or go into a subject room to be with those of similar interest. The Kinky Basement is for guys into kink talk as well as beating off, the Boner Room is for all kinds of jo scenes, and the Friendship Lounge is for guys seeking a non-sexual chat with cyber friends. And, you may see other rooms which members have created, because you can create your own room, for your own purpose. <br><br>
What to chat about? Well, of course, all your erotic personal stuff. But also about gay clips on Gayties. Gay videos are a hot social network topic here, as well as kink and romance.
We ask everyone to be courteous and patient as we all get to learn more about how chat works. Finally, we suggest one other thing, … be adventurous and have fun. <br><br></span><img src="https://www.gayties.com/media/blank.gif" border="0" style="width:0px;height:0px;" alt="" id="vldbannerid_408" /></div>	</p>
