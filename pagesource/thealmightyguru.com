		<li>Mississippi Republicans, who have decreased their state's abortion clinics down to one, have passed a new law outlawing abortion after 15 weeks. It's a completely arbitrary length of time considering that

		<a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/03/15/593844812/trump-admits-to-making-up-trade-deficit-in-talks-with-canadian-prime-minister">every country has a trade deficit with the US.</a>.</li>
		<li>Thankfully, people are beginning to see the Republican party for the cesspool it is, like in Pennsylvania's traditionally Republican 18th Congressional District. The existing Congressman, Republican Tim 
		Murphy, resigned in disgrace after it came out that, despite claiming to be fiercely pro-family and anti-abortion, he was cheating on his wife, then pressured his mistress into getting an abortion after he found 
		out she was pregnant! This created a special election and Democrat Conor Lamb <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/pennsylvania-special-election-conor-lamb-rick-saccone-n856411">appears to have 
		won</a> despite the district having been gerrymandered to give Republicans a massive edge over Democrats!</li>
		<li>Because Trump was too stupid to sign his own non-disclosure agreement after having an affair with a porn star, we're probably going to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1d0h1Yf6Zk">get the 
		details</a>.</li>
		<li>As is typical of Republican tact, Leslie Gibson calls the survivors of the Parkland, Florida massacre 
		<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/skinhead-lesbian-gop-candidate-attacks-parkland-teen-emma-gonzalez-n856311">"skin head lesbians" and "bald-faced liars."</a> In my home town, the public school 
		administration created a massive safety violation when they locked all of the students inside their classrooms, not for their protection, but rather to 
		<a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2018/03/grand_blanc_school_locks_doors.html">prevent them from protesting</a> in the <a href="https://www.womensmarch.com/enough-faq">#Enough walkout</a>. 
		Principal Michael Fray explained that he did this to to maintain school safety, but if a fire started, the students and teachers would have all died. The students, undaunted, still formed a sit-in in front of 
		the main office.</li>

		<li>Trump's incompetence in global trade is not only <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhqj1-s5rqs">injuring the US in the world market</a>, but now, even our allies are forming new trade groups

		<li>Republican <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Zinke">Ryan Zinke</a> is a Trump goon. Like most of Trump's goons, he was place in charge of the very organization he hopes to destroy. In Zinke's case, he 
		has worked for years to eliminate environmental protections, stop protecting endangered species, eliminate national monuments and protected lands, return the use of toxic lead bullets, and has lobbied for greater 
		reliance on fossil fuels. Naturally, Trump put Zinke in charge of the Department of the Interior, whose job it is to protect the nation's natural resources, and, naturally, Zinke is destroying them as fast as 
		possible. His most recent push is to get the Department of the Interior <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/03/06/us/ap-us-zinke-energy.html">partnered with oil companies</a>.</li>
		<li>Republican Ted Cruz's real name is "Rafael," but Republicans don't vote for people with non-Uhmerican sounding names, so he goes by "Ted." Fair enough. So why is he now accusing his Democratic opponent, Robert

		<li>Republican Valerie Huber is now in charge of doling out federal funds for sexual education, but she is the former president of the National Abstinence Education Association, so you can pretty much predict that 
		funding for sex ed <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2018/03/07/abstinence-advocate-gets-veto-power-over-286-million-in-family-planning-funding/">will be eliminated</a>.</li>

		<p>When a computer technician finds illegal content on a computer they're fixing, they have a duty to report that content to the authorities just like anyone else witnessing a crime. However, when the authorities 
		put a bounty on illegal content, they create an incentive for technicians to actively search through your computer in hopes of finding something illegal. Now, they are not just technicians, but a paid arm of law 
		enforcement. How can you avoid inadvertently giving your computer to law enforcement pretending to be a technician? Step one, never take you computer to Best Buy or Geek Squad. Apparently, the FBI pays their 
		technicians $500 for each <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/07/eff-geek-squad-fbi-relationship">customer they turn in</a>.</p>

		<p>The NSA doesn't help security, in fact, they have a long history of learning about security flaws and then exploiting them, even against fellow Americans. So, when the NSA has a leak, it's a boon for hackers 
		who use all their secrets to exploit people all over the world until actual security firms can fix all of the security flaws. It's now been almost a year since the NSA's EternalBlue secret was leaked to the public, 
		and hackers, including those in North Korea, are still using it to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/eternalblue-leaked-nsa-spy-tool-hacked-world/">exploit computers around the world</a>.</p>

		<li>Marco Rubio, after a mass shooting that left a bunch of children dead, stupidly assumed the crowd wouldn't want to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q34E5ONJSbA">ban assault rifles</a>, and Trump thinks 
		it's a great idea to give a gun to your near-sighted 65-year-old math <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiiuUzFQ2Bg">teacher</a>. And while many gun nuts don't understand that Chicago's gun problem comes from 
		the neighboring cities that sell to Chicago residents, some people are actually making a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nlpBvRDRpw">real difference</a>, unlike Republican Rick Santorum who believes 
		children go on shooting sprees because of <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2018/02/25/republican-rick-santorum-blames-mass-shootings-on-single-mothers/">single mothers</a>.</li>

		step back into the stone age of employment. We may see the elimination of weekends, vacations, sick leave, and all the other worker benefits that only exist because of unions. At least they made the right call

		<li>As students from Parkland, Florida traveled to protest in Washington D.C., Republicans in their home state rejected a proposed 
		<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/20/us/florida-legislature-weapons-ban/index.html">ban on assault rifles</a>.</li>
		<li>Republican Shawn Harrison had to fire his aide, Benjamin Kelly, because Kelly claimed, in an official capacity, that the students in the Parkland, Florida massacre weren't real students,

		<li>Republicans may be ignoring all the children being murdered, but they aren't doing nothing. Why, just yesterday all their hard work paid off and they were able to keep the woefully incompetent Jared Kushner in 
		his senior White House advisor role, despite <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-kushner/white-house-says-trump-son-in-law-kushner-can-do-job-without-security-clearance-idUSKCN1G42SD">losing his

		<li>Georgia Republicans have passed a bill that will allow Christian adoption agencies to refuse to place orphan children in same-sex families, not because they feel same-sex couples will be incapable parents, but 
		because <a href="https://thegavoice.com/georgia-senate-committee-passes-anti-lgbtq-adoption-bill/">they're bigots</a>.</li>
		<li>But it's not all bad news, the Republican clusterfuck is causing people to vote against them

		<li>We currently live in a country where the ridiculous morning TV show "Fox and Friends" has more control over the president <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1d7UvKWh6M">than anyone else</a>.</li>
		<li>Of course Republicans aren't doing anything to stop Russians from interfering in US elections, a major reason why they won was because of Russian interference. But, when even George W. Bush is telling you that 
		Russian are interfering with the election, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1zHtig9BZA">you know it's serious</a>.</li>
		<li>The new Republican budget proposal is not only increasing the deficit to over $7,000,000,000,000, but now they're eliminating all help for student loan repayments which is going to keep current students in debt 
		and scare potential students away from <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/12/trumps-budget-would-end-student-loan-forgiveness-program.html">entering universities</a>. It also eliminates 22 programs meant to help

		<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43034786">that were once free</a>.</li>
		<li>Trump is also trying to eliminate funding for public television and radio like <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/media/373434-trump-proposes-eliminating-federal-funding-for-pbs-npr">PBS and NPR</a>.</li>
		<li>Low-income families who qualify for the SNAP program receive a EBT card which they can use to purchase food for their family. Republicans want to change this, and instead send the families a package of "food" 
		heavily processed for longer-shelf life. So, instead of parents being able to buy fresh fruits and vegetables, they will receive canned vegetables. Instead of whole grains, they will get

		officer showed up and shot the man to death, only to find Mader was right, the man's gun was unloaded. But the Weirton, West Virginia police fired Mader for not immediately killing the man like his trigger-happy 
		fellow officer. Well, Mader <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police-practices/police-officer-wins-settlement-city-fired-him">won his lawsuit</a>, and the city has wasted $175,000 in
