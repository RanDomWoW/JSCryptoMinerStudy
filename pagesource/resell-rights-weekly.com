<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 80px" align=left>Hi Friend, <BR><BR>My name is Mark Austin, and there's something I want to ask you: <BR><BR>
<IMG src="http://resell-rights-weekly.com/members/images/100pfree2.jpg" width=275 height=179 align="right">
How would you like to have <B><U>free instant access</U></B> to hundreds of dollars worth of private label rights products and resale rights products? Keep reading to find out how!<BR><BR>You probably already know this, but one of the easiest ways to make serious money on the internet is by selling digital products. It's a fairly simple process ...</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 130px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 130px" align=left><B>1)</B> You purchase a product with resale rights.<BR><B>2)</B> You resell that product as many times as you want.<BR><B>3)</B> You keep 100% of the money!</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 80px" align=left>Of course, you can repeat the above process with as many products as you want!&nbsp;As you can see, it's a fairly simple process! </P>
<H2>But, there's just one small catch ...</H2>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 80px" align=left>You can spend a ton of money buying products with Private Label Rights (PLR) or Resale Rights (RR)! For instance, take my friend Tony Jamerson ... <BR><BR>Tony recently told me that he used to spend right at $600 every month on resale rights products. You see, Tony was trying to increase his online income -- he was <I><U>trying</U></I> to get ahead. </P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 80px" align=left>Instead, he was falling further and further behind financially. He was spending way too much time chasing down Resale Rights products, and way too much money buying them!</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 80px" align=left>Worse yet, Tony and his wife Lisa were having marital problems partly because of the financial stress caused by him spending that $600 every month on RR products! </P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 80px" align=left>Sadly, Tony finally got to a point where he just felt like giving up. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? Let me ask you a question ...</P>
<H2>How Much Have You Spent On Resale Rights Products Lately?</H2>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 80px" align=left>Way too much, right? Don't feel bad because you're definitely not alone! <IMG height=15 alt="" src="http://resell-rights-weekly.com/members/images/smile.jpg" width=15> <BR><BR>I know several people (like my friend Tony) who spend well over $500 each month just on resale rights products! <BR><BR>Just think about that a second ... most resale rights products sell for anywhere from $27 on up to $197. And that's just for one product! What if you wanted to purchase rights to five products each month? Or ten? You would have to spend at least $300 - $500 every single month! But ...</P>
<H2>Now Just Imagine:</H2>

These products have either Private Label Rights or Resale Rights. You can resell these products as many times as you want, and you keep 100% of the money!
<BR><BR>
After you sign up for your Free Membership in Resell Rights Weekly, you will have <B>free instant access to hundreds of dollars worth of digital products.</B> <BR><BR>How many products, you ask? At last count it was <B>728 products</B> in the membership ready for you to download. Plus every week, 2 new downloadable products with either PLR or RR will be added to the membership.
<BR><BR>
Most memberships charge $20 and up per month, and they stock the members area with old outdated products. That doesn't happen at Resell Rights Weekly! You'll be able to download fresh new quality products in the member's area. RRW is the membership that overdelivers ... like the Golden Rule says, <i>'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you!'

Hi Mark,
<br><br>
RRW Gold Membership gives me opportunity to start earning money online. For the last five months I have sold the products on my website and I have earned $ 500 per month to date, and my earning is continue growing.
<br><br>
Not only that! After 3 months of joining a Gold Membership I have three persons signed up as Gold Member in my downline.That's means I have paid $ 0 membership fee plus I am earning some extra cash monthly.
<br><br>
Thank you Mark. <b> Your Gold Membership is truly a goldmine for me.</b>  It is full of new resell rights products every week plus useful resources and training.
The Gold Membership is the most crucial decision and the best choice I have ever made.

	I believe a person just entering the Internet business world can succeed by using the products you "give away free" with some effort put to them and used as instructed.<br>
	<br>
	I really don't see how a person cannot be successful!! And that's just on the free products. <b>The Gold membership is really a value well above and beyond the price asked.</b><br>

Hi Mark,<br>
<br>
Well, what can I say. What a <b>fantastic package your Resell-Rights-Weekly monthly membership is</b>. The 2 options you have for membership are both <b>outstanding value.</b><br>
<br>
The free membership is a <b>must have</b> for marketers wanting fresh subject matter. The content covers many niche areas. Once the quality of the free membership level is realized <b>most people I feel would want to upgrade to Gold level at the very affordable price.</b> Web hosting is included as standard in the paid membership option.<br>
<br>
Great customer support noted!<br>

Anybody can throw together a bunch of old outdated crap and call it a membership site, but Mark has gone above and beyond by assembling <b>the best of the best.</b> And his Gold Membership is even more incredible!
<br><br>
Can you even begin to see the value in this?  I don't mean to be offensive, but if you can't see what a bargain this is, then you either don't care about being in the info marketing business, or you're braindead!
<br><br>
Sometimes I spend literally hundreds of dollars a month buying Master and Private Label rights books so I have something new and fresh to offer my subscribers. Thanks to Mark and Resell Rights Weekly, my expenses have been cut to a mere fraction of what they were, and my customers are ecstatic to be getting all this great new content!
<br><br>
My advice? <b>Don't stop at the free membership, but go straight to the Gold Membership</b> and get on board now before he realizes just how bad<BR> he's shortchanging himself and raises the price!

<P class=ptesty align=left>When you purchase a digital product (whether it be an ebook, MP3 audio file, video, software script, or whatever ...) you will receive a product license with that product.

You are also allowed to alter the product however you see fit. You also may claim that you are the author, but you can't claim the copyright to the product. Generally, you are allowed to take that product and modify it in any way that you please. This means you can take the raw product, change it, add to it, take away from it, and claim it as your own! And also, you can place your name on it and market that product as your own.

Mark,
<br><br>
<b>Thanks for the great resource!</b> I’m always on the lookout for more products I can use for my sites and learn from as well. I can tell you take the time to manually review every product in the membership. <b>The private label products you provide are top-notch</b> and I love reselling them and tearing them apart for other uses.
<br><br>
The direct links to various tools and resources in the toolbox is now bookmarked and I revisit it quite often. Your online university is quite extensive and I learned a few new things. Personally, I liked learning more about joint ventures and watching the web 2.0 videos. Overall, great job and keep up the good work.

Hi Mark,
<BR><BR>
You know what I love most about you? You care and are a <b>man of character and integrity!</b> That is severely lacking in this day and age. Most people a person writes get around to you when they feel like it, sometimes never.
<BR><BR>
I forget how long I have been with you, but I do remember joining for free, then upgrading to gold. Don't get in there very often because of this cancer but find the highest quality info when I need it.

Again thanks Mark for your friendship and service and your wonderful site.

<H2>OK Mark, Why Is This Membership Free?</H2>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 80px" align=left>The answer to that question will <B>shock you</B> because it is going to be surprisingly simple & honest. <BR><BR>First of all, as corny as this may sound, I truly like to help other people. Life is <B>NOT</B> just about making more money, 'climbing the corporate ladder', and being super successful! While those things are necessary and certainly have their place, what's most important in life is <EM><STRONG>family and friends</STRONG></EM> ... in one word: <U>relationships</U>. <BR><BR>You see, I have been very fortunate in life as I have been blessed with family and friends who have helped me to succeed ... and now I want to help you to succeed as well! <BR><BR>Secondly, <B>I offer a Gold Membership level in Resell Rights Weekly</B>. Many of the people who sign up for the Free Membership later decide to join the Gold Membership (you'll hear more about the Gold level later after you join). The income that comes from the RRW Gold membership makes it possible for me to offer you this free membership possible. But don't worry,  you are under absolutely no obligation to upgrade ...  <EM>you can stay a free member forever if you choose</EM>!

Hi Mark,
<br><br>
<b> Resell Rights Weekly blew me away!</b>
<br><br>
I had been referred by someone I trust and decided to take a peek. Once I logged in and saw the $1 Gold Membership Trial it was clear to me that I was going to be very happy with my purchase and would be staying on board permanently.
<br><br>
RWW offers more value that any membership site that I have ever been a member of. RWW has everything you need to be successful online including a high converting affiliate opportunity.

Hi Mark,
<br><br>
In this ever increasing market of pressure sales I wanted to let you know that <b>your offer is an incredible breath of fresh air!!</b> Your style of presenting the "offer" without making me feel like I'd be an idiot if I didn't take you up on your offer was what clinched the deal for me.
<br><br>
And when I confirmed my email address I was bracing myself for the big red stop-sign or policeman type hand that always makes me want to scream (lol) but you just continued in the same fashion as before. Just presented the facts and explained the benefits.
<br><br>
I'm a gold member now and thank-you again for creating such a pleasant "shopping" experience!  I'm simply amazed at how much value you offer in the gold<br>members area! <b>It literally is a gold mine!</b> Thanks again!

Hi Mark,

I just signed up for the gold membership, and I'm totally blown away. I have never, & I truthfully mean I have never seen or belonged to something this fantastic.
<br><br>
What you guys have here, nothing even comes close to this. I've been clicking around like crazy in the members area, and I have never seen so much info & tools. This is <b>what I call hitting the jackpot.</b>
<br><br>
All I can say is anybody out there that signed up for the Free Membership, one day when you wise up & go for the GOLD, you'll be amazed at what you just put your hands on. The free membership has a lot, but wait till you upgrade. And I do mean that sincerely.
<br><br>
Just thought I'd send you this e-mail to give you a big thanks.

Hi Mark,
<br><br>
It seems to me Resell Rights Weekly is growing all the time and very quickly, and I am sure Mark the most important aspect <b>what people appreciate is your top notch customer service, responsibility, and responsivity to members as well as good products on the site.</b>
<br><br>
People generally are very skeptics nowadays.  It is very rare to meet that kind of service nowadays.
<br><br>
All the best and thanks again,<br><br>
