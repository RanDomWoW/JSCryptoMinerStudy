                <h2>About 8GadgetPack</h2>
                <p>8GadgetPack makes it possible to use gadgets on Windows 10 / 8.1 / 8.<br /></p>
                <p><a href="#Howto">How-to</a> <a href="#FAQ">FAQ</a> <a href="#Versionhistory">Version history</a></p>
                <a name="Howto"></a>
                <h2>How-to</h2>
                <p>First you need to download the installer (the link is on the top right of this page) and open it. This window will appear:</p>
                <img data-original="tut/tut1.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" class="img_ce img_border" />
                <p>Click on Install.</p>
                <img data-original="tut/tut2.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" class="img_ce img_border" />
                <p>And here you click on Yes.</p>
                <img data-original="tut/tut3.jpg" alt="" width="538" height="417" class="img_ce img_border" />
                <p>After a while (it can take some minutes) the installer will be complete and you need to click on Finish.</p>
                <img data-original="tut/tut4.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" class="img_ce img_border" />
                <p>These three default gadgets will appear on the right side.</p>
                <img data-original="tut/tut5.jpg" alt="" width="184" height="105" class="img_ce img_border" />
                <p>Click on the plus symbol on the top right to see all available gadgets.</p>
                <img data-original="tut/tut6.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" class="img_ce img_border" />
                <p>Here you can add a gadget to your desktop by double-clicking on it.</p>
                <img data-original="tut/tut7.jpg" alt="" width="141" height="158" class="img_ce img_border" />
                <p>If you move your cursor above a gadget you can drag it around your desktop. It doesn't need to stay on the sidebar. There will also appear some buttons next to the gadget. Click on the X to close a gadget or on the wrench icon to access its options.</p>
                <img data-original="tut/tut8.jpg" alt="" width="391" height="517" class="img_ce img_border" />
                <p>The options of the clock gadget allow you to enable the second hand or to change the timezone.</p>
                <img data-original="tut/tut9.jpg" alt="" width="315" height="328" class="img_ce img_border" />
                <p>The next gadget is a clipboard manager. Here I copied the installer file and then the name of the file. Clipboarder will display everything you copy to the clipboard. By clicking on an element you make it the current clipboard. This way you can select older clipboards and paste them into other applications. You can also open a clipboard directly.</p>
                <img data-original="tut/tut10.jpg" alt="" width="390" height="550" class="img_ce img_border" />
                <p>The options of Clipboarder allow many possibilities. You can use the shortcut Win+C to select an older clipboarder (works well together with Ctrl+V).</p>
                <img data-original="tut/tut11.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="493" class="img_ce img_border" />
                <p>The options of the last gadget, the weather gadget, allow you to change the city.</p>
                <img data-original="tut/tut12.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" class="img_ce img_border" />
                <p>You can also right-click on the sidebar. If you don't like the sidebar you can close it there. You will still be able to use the gadgets. Click on options to change the behaviour of the sidebar.</p>
                <img data-original="tut/tut13.jpg" alt="" width="485" height="427" class="img_ce img_border" />
                <p>Here you can, for example, click on the first checkbox to make the sidebar always visible. This way you have your gadgets always in sight. A disadvantage is though, that the close button of maximized windows isn't on the top-right corner anymore. To fix this you can put the sidebar on the left side.</p>
                <img data-original="tut/tut14.jpg" alt="" width="469" height="417" class="img_ce img_border" />
                <p>Alternatively you can enable the second checkbox on the view tab.</p>
                <img data-original="tut/tut15.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" class="img_ce img_border" />
                <p>Here is a maximized video player and you can close it by using the X on the top-right of the screen. Of couse this will work for non-maximized windows as well.</p>
                <img data-original="tut/tut16.jpg" alt="" width="334" height="239" class="img_ce img_border" />
                <p>You can access some advanced options by right-clicking on the X. For example you can add a preview of the application to the sidebar.</p>
                <img data-original="tut/tut17.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="288" class="img_ce img_border" />
                <p>This way you can keep track of some applications on the side. You can hover with your cursor over the preview to peek into the window, just like in the taskbar. Right-clicking on the preview gives you some options as well.</p>
                <img data-original="tut/tut18.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" class="img_ce img_border" />
                <p>There are several weather gadgets included.</p>
                <img data-original="tut/tut19.jpg" alt="" width="239" height="250" class="img_ce img_border" />
                <p>Right-click on a gadget allows you to change its opacity. You can also access some general options about gadgets by selecting 8GadgetPack Tools:</p>
                <img data-original="tut/tut20.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" class="img_ce img_border" />

                <a name="FAQ"></a>
                <h2>FAQ</h2>
                <ul class="tmo_ul_list">
                    <li>Is it free?<br />Yes, completely</li>
                    <li>I didn't really use gadgets previously. Is it really worth installing these?<br />You should try it. The gadgets included are really useful when working with the PC. Unlike Metro-Apps gadgets can access useful system-information. The included Clipboard-Manager gadget for example will highly improve your productivity. With the Sidebar gadget, you can make the gadgets visible while working with maximized windows. Monitoring network traffic, setting the volume with one click and having an analog clock visible all the time are things you don't want to give up once you get used to it.</li>
                    <li>Windows 10 updated and automatically uninstalled 8GadgetPack!<br />Older versions of 8GadgetPack wern't compatible. Just reinstall the current version and everything should work.</li>
                    <li>Win+G on Windows 10 is assigned to the game bar. But I want to use it to access my gadgets!<br />Version 15 and later lets you override the shortcut to use it for gadgets. You can control this option in the 8GadgetPack Tools menu.</li>
                    <li>The gadgets look very tiny, especially on screens with high resolutions. Can they be made bigger?<br />Windows 8.1 (and Windows 7 with Internet Explorer 11 installed) introduced a bug that prevented gadgets from scaling properly according to the DPI-setting. In version 13 I was finally able to find a workaround that fixes this. You just need to upgrade to solve this. You can even configure a custom scaling by using the registry files found in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Sidebar\8GadgetPack".</li>
                    <li>Is this English-Only?<br />The installer is available only in English, but many of the gadgets have many localizations.</li>
                    <li>What are the requirements?<br />This works on Windows 7 / 8 / 8.1 / 10. Administrative rights are required to install.</li>
                    <li>Does it work on Windows 7?<br />Yes! Version 12 and higher can be installed even on Windows 7. Windows 7 already does have gadgets by default, but this program gives you an easy way to install many high-quality gadgets. It can also bring the gadgets back in case they were disabled or uninstalled. In case you don't like 8GadgetPack you can uninstall it and still use the gadgets provided by Windows 7.</li>
                    <li>Why is there a sidebar? Windows 7 didn't have one.<br />This is actually just a gadget to help you keeping the gadgets organized and visible. You can right-click on it and select "close sidebar" to do so. Even with the sidebar the gadgets can still be moved onto the desktop as you like. Or you can even add more sidebars by adding the gadget "7 Sidebar". This is especially useful when working with multiple monitors. You can also make the sidebar appear automatically when touching the border and customize its design. Right-click on it and select options to do so.</li>
                    <li>Will 8GadgetPack install some crap on my PC?<br />No, the installer will only install the original Microsoft files and set the neccessary registry entries to make the gadgets work again. The only addition is a small tool (8GadgetPack Tools) which fixes several bugs and allows you to change various settings. There is also an uninstaller included which removes everything the installer added. I could make quite some money by adding adware to the installer, but I'm sure you appreciate it that this installer is clean.</li>
                    <li>Aren't gadgets unsafe? Afterall, didn't Microsoft remove them for a reason?<br />Gadgets can contain viruses like any other software. Despite the warning when installing a gadget people seemed to think that it is safe to run any gadget (e.g. like it is to view a website). That is not the case. Opening a gadget is as dangerous as it is to run an .exe file. But this is not a security hole. If an attacker wanted to access your computer, he'd need to convince you to open his prepared .gadget file. As long as you trust the source of the gadgets you install and you use anti-virus software you should be safe.<br />Quote from Microsofts official statement to this: "How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability? An attacker would have to convince a user to install and enable a vulnerable Gadget." (<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/2719662">source</a>)</li>
                    <li>Some monitoring gadgets display the graph incorrectly. How to fix this?<br />Unfortunately I wasn't able to fix this issue. The bug occurs deep in the internet explorer rendering api and I wasn't able to find a workaround. You can however use the gadgets Glassy CPU Monitor and Glassy Network Monitor I made which don't have this issue.</li>
                    <li>Will I be able to install gadgets other than the ones included?<br />Yes, when 8GadgetPack is installed you can open and install .gadget files made for Windows Vista or Windows 7. But be careful, gadgets can contain, just like other programs, viruses or trojans.</li>
                    <li>Will all gadgets work that worked on Windows 7?<br />No, some gadgets don't work or are unreliable on Windows 8 / 10. This is mostly because of Internet Explorer 11 which the gadgets internally rely on. 8GadgetPack already uses some tricks to workaround some problems but if you have issues with a gadget you better contact the author of the gadget and ask him to fix it. There are also some gadgets that work on Windows 7 / 8, but not on 10, most notably Network monitoring gadgets (but the ones in 8GadgetPack all work).</li>
                    <li>I already installed an older version of 8GadgetPack. What do I have to do to upgrade?<br />Simply download the current installer and run it. It will update your installation and even update outdated gadgets automatically. You don't have to uninstall first. All gadget settings will remain.</li>
                    <li>There appears some error message in the installer.<br />First, try to download the installer again and check if the error still appears.<br />Try to download and run <a href="http://8gadgetpack.net/8GadgetPackUninstaller.exe">this removal tool</a>. It is a small program I made that can remove broken installations, and also removes all gadgets and gadget settings.<br />If that is not working, try the following: Go to TaskManager > Details > Explorer.exe and click on End Task. Now click on File in Task Manager > type Explorer.exe and check the box below (Create this task with administrative privileges). Now try the installation again.<br />Now if that's not working either, try to download and run <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Program_Install_and_uninstall">this</a>.<br />You can also try this:<br /> - Hold shift and right-click on the MSI file.<br /> - Select: "Copy as Path"<br /> - Press Win+X and select "Command Promt (Admin)"<br /> - In CMD, right-click and select Paste, hit Enter and try to install again.<br />And if that's not helping <a href="http://tiny.cc/feedbackbuhler">contact</a> me and don't forget to mention the error message.</li>
                    <li>The uninstaller doesn't work!<br />Please download and start <a href="http://8gadgetpack.net/8GadgetPackUninstaller.exe">this removal tool</a> to fix this. (Also check the question above)</li>
                    <li>Some error message appears when I try to open gadgets!<br />Some gadgets require the .NET Framework to be installed. Try this: Press Win+X, select control panel, search for "Turn Windows features on or off" and select everything with ".NET" in its name. Press OK.</li>
                    <li>For some monitoring gadget, I get a WMI error!<br />Please follow <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/9b01e1a6-d872-4f28-9280-f35d6ca02a9f/lodctr-r-error-code-2?forum=w7itprogeneral">these</a> instructions.</li>
                    <li>I am running AVG anti-virus and gadgets don't start or there appear errors!<br />
 The Identity protection sometimes blocks this software without even notifying. You can verify that 8GadgetPack doesn't contain any viruses on <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/">VirusTotal</a> and then follow these steps to add an exception for 8GadgetPack:<br/>
 1. Double-click on the AVG anti-virus tray icon in the bottom right area.<br/>
 2. Select "Options", then "Advanced settings...".<br/>
 3. Select "Exceptions"<br/>
 4. Click on the "Add Exception" button.<br/>
 5. Click the "Exception Type" drop-down menu and select "Application or File".<br/>
 6. Copy and paste the following text into the textbox and press "OK".<br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Sidebar\8GadgetPack.exe<br/>
 7. Repeat the steps 4-6 with the following texts:<br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Sidebar\sidebar.exe<br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C:\Program Files\Windows Sidebar\8GadgetPack.exe<br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C:\Program Files\Windows Sidebar\sidebar.exe<br/>
 8. Click "OK" to apply the new setting. Click "Yes" if Windows asks permission to save the change.<br/>
 (Note: The entries for the x86 version are neccessary even if you only use the 64-bit version.)
</li>
                    <li>A gadget doesn't seem to be working. What can I do?<br />The best choice is to contact the author of the gadget. I cannot do much about it (unless I made the gadget), I just ship the original gadgets files to make gadgets working under Windows 8. If it is a Microsoft gadget that does not work you are out of luck. They didn't just discontinue gadgets but also seem to shut down the servers required by the weather, currency and stocks gadget. There are a bunch of alternative weather gadgets included in the pack and dozens of such gadgets can be found on the internet.</li>
                    <li>Is there a way to do a silent install?<br />Yes. First download the installer and save it under C:. Open a Command Promt as Admin (Right-click on the startbutton and select it). Then type the following:<br />msiexec.exe /i "C:\8GadgetPackSetup.msi" /qn /norestart<br />You can close the Command Promt then. After a while the gadgets option will appear in the desktop right-click menu.<br />The installer will allow every user on the computer to use gadgets, but the gadgets are not actually shown for a user until they are selected from the desktop context-menu.</li>
                    <li>I have a gadget that requires the 32-bit version of the sidebar. What do I do?<br />The installer does install both the 32 and 64-bit version of sidebar.exe on 64-bit Windows. You simply need to run C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Sidebar\sidebar.exe to run the 32-bit version.</li>
                    <li>Is it possible to put the sidebar horizontal on top or bottom?<br />No, sorry. It is often requested, but an implementation would have many problems.</li>
                    <li>How can I backup my gadgets, transfer them between PCs or delete them all together?<br />To access the directory where the gadgets are stored, press Win+R and paste the following text: "%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Sidebar\Gadgets" and hit Enter. Each folder there contains a gadget and you can do with them whatever you like. If you screw up, select "Reset all gadgets" in the 8Gadgetpack Tools.</li>
                    <li>I just want to have a clock gadget on my desktop and not all this stuff that comes with 8GadgetPack. Is there some "light version"?<br/>Sorry, the installer system I use doesn't allow this. But you can easily delete all extra gadgets after the installation by going to the folder mentioned 1 question above and deleting all folders inside of it. You save about 40MB on your harddrive this way.</li>
                    <li>How do I uninstall/reinstall a gadget?<br />Right-click on desktop, select Gadgets, right-click on the desired gadget and select Uninstall. To reinstall, download the .gadget file and open it after Uninstall.</li>
                    <li>How do I install a gadget?<br />Double-click on the .gadget file. If that doesn't work, try to reinstall 8GadgetPack.</li>
                    <li>Gadgets don't run at startup. What to do?<br />Go to start, select 8GadgetPack Tools and disable and then enable Autorun there. If that doesn't work, try to reinstall 8GadgetPack.</li>
                    <li>Can I choose the installation directory?<br />No, due to technical reasons 8GadgetPack will always install in these directories: (assuming C: is the system-drive)<br />64-bit installation: "C:\Program Files\Windows Sidebar"<br />32-bit installation: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Sidebar"<br />Non-Microsoft Gadgets: "%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Sidebar\Gadgets"<br />On Windows 7 the existing files in these directories are not touched by the installer and will also remain after uninstall.</li>
                    <li>I want to have multiple rows of gadgets. Is that possible?<br />Yes! Simply add the gadget "7 Sidebar" multiple times and arrange the gadgets how you want.</li>
                    <li>Can I use the keyboard to access the gadgets?<br />Yes! Press Win+Shift+G to show the gadgets and to switch between them. Use Tab to switch between gadgets that are docked to a sidebar. Open 8GadgetPack Tools if you would like to use Win+G and override the gamebar hotkey.</li>
                    <li>Is there a way to position the gadgets just where I like them on the sidebar?<br />Yes, you can hold Shift while positioning them to keep the sidebar from automatically aligning them.</li>
                </ul>
