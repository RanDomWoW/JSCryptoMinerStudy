        <blockquote>Physically based rendering has transformed computer graphics
            lighting by more accurately simulating materials and lights,
            allowing digital artists to focus on cinematography rather than
            the intricacies of rendering. First published in 2004,
            Physically Based Rendering is both a textbook and a complete
            source-code implementation that has provided a widely adopted
            practical roadmap for most physically based shading and
            lighting systems used in film production.

      <h1>The Book</h1>
    </div>

    <p><i>Physically Based Rendering</i>, Third Edition describes both the
      mathematical theory behind a modern photorealistic rendering system
      as well as its practical implementation. A method known as  &ldquo;literate
      programming&rdquo; combines human-readable documentation and source code
      into a single reference that is specifically designed to aid
      comprehension. Through the ideas and software in this book, you will
      learn to design and employ a full-featured rendering system for
      creating stunning imagery.</p>

    <p>This new edition greatly refines its best-selling predecessor by
    adding sections on bidirectional light transport; stochastic
    progressive photon mapping; a significantly-improved subsurface
    scattering implementation; numerical robustness issues in ray-object
    intersection; microfacet reflection models; realistic camera models;
    and much more.  These updates reflect the current state-of-the-art
    technology, and along with the lucid pairing of text and code, ensure
    the book's leading position as a reference text for those working in
    rendering.</p>

    <p>The author team of Matt Pharr, Greg Humphreys, and Pat Hanrahan
    garnered a 2014 Academy Award for Scientific and Technical Achievement
    from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences based on the
    knowledge shared in the first and second editions of the book this
    book. The Academy called the book a  &ldquo;widely adopted practical roadmap
    for most physically based shading and lighting systems used in film
    production.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>For a preview, you can download both Chapter
      7, <i><a href="chapters/pbrt_chapter7.pdf">Sampling and
      Reconstruction</a></i>, from the first edition of the book as well as
      Chapter 4, <i><a href="chapters/pbrt-2ed-chap4.pdf">Primitives and
      Intersection Acceleration</a></i> from the second edition.</p>
