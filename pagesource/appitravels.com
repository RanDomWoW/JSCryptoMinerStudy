                          <p><strong><em>Q) Is  Appi Travels Ltd a Guaranteed Income?</em></strong><br />
                            <em>A) Appi Travels cannot and will not guarantee any  income for its affiliates. Every person on this planet is different. Some  people work and some don&rsquo;t, so the potential earnings depends on every  individual performance (refer to income disclaimer at  the bottom of the website)</em>.</p>
                          <p><strong><em>Q) Can I get a refund?</em></strong><em><br />
                            A) No Refund Policy. Once you become an affiliate you have immediate access to  all the products and services in your membership. Appi Travels LTD pays out out  100% commissions of the product purchase back to its affiliates in real- time.  Affiliates click the ''accept&rdquo; and show that they have read the terms and  conditions before they register or pay. This is to ensure that we are NOT  forcing anyone to purchase our products and services. Full access to our full  range of products and services is immediate upon sign up. For this&nbsp;reason,&nbsp;we have a <strong>no refund</strong> policy. During the  registration and before becoming an active member, everyone who signs up must  accept the terms and conditions which ensures that they are aware of them and  understand them. </em><em>(Refer to refund policy at the bottom of  the website.)</em></p>
                          <p><strong><em>Q) How do I register and pay to get active?</em></strong><br />
                              <em>A) If you are not active, click on the Join Us button  on the Appi Travels website, all the information is there. Ensure you register  to the right sponsor. Affiliates who do not have credit cards or bank accounts,  that is not an issue. There are many ways to fund your Bitcoin account.  Procedures are there once you have reached the payment option page. You may  also get in contact with your sponsor to help  walk you through the process. &nbsp;</em></p>
                          <p><strong><em>Q) What is the difference between the Explorer and the  Navigator?</em></strong><br />
                              <em>A) <strong>Explorer</strong> is an affordable level for everyone at the purchase of $50 +$25 admin fee.  It enables you to earn $25 commission and $25 in 100% RRMB.</em><br />
                              <strong><em>Navigator</em></strong><em> is a purchase level of $300 + $50 admin fee. It enables  you to earn $150 commission and $150 in 100% RRMB.</em></p>
                          <p><strong><em>Q) Can a member join the </em></strong><strong><em>Explorer plus the Navigator at the same time?</em></strong><br />
                              <em>A) Yes! The cost will be $425.</em></p>
                          <p><strong><em>Q) </em></strong><strong><em>If an affiliate is in the Navigator and does not  purchase the Explorer but sponsors an affiliate into the Explorer, does the  member&rsquo;s referral in the Explorer follow him into the Navigator?</em></strong><br />
                              <em>A) Of course! Once your referred affiliate upgrades in  the Navigator they will follow their sponsor in his Navigator. You as a sponsor  will lose all his commissions and 100% RRMB in the Explorer though because you  did not purchase the Explorer level.</em></p>
                          <p><strong><em>Q) </em></strong><strong><em>If an Affiliate is at the Explorer level and upgrades  to the Navigator level before his sponsor, does the sponsor lose his referred  affiliate in the Navigator?</em></strong><br />
                              <em>A) The sponsor will lose his referred affiliate to the  next up line in the Navigator level, his sponsor. The sponsor loses his  referred affiliate with the commission payout, but not the 100% RRMB. </em><br />
                              <br />
                              <strong><em>Q) </em></strong><strong><em>If an Affiliate is at the Explorer level and upgrades  to the Navigator level before his sponsor, when is the sponsor eligible to  collect 100% RRMB.</em></strong><br />
                              <em>A) The sponsor will start to receive his referred  affiliates Navigator 100% RRMB only once the sponsor upgrades to Navigator.</em></p>
                          <p><strong><em>Q) What  does RRMB mean?</em></strong><br />
                              <em><u>A) </u></em><em><u>Residual Referral Matching Bonus (RRMB)</u> </em><em>For  every affiliate that you refer you will receive a 100% matching bonus (RRMB),  not only on their revenue but also on their travel points. That&rsquo;s right! When  your referred affiliates make commissions and travel points, you receive a 100%  Matching Bonus (RRMB) on their commissions and travel points as well. </em><br />
                              <strong><em>Example Commissions + (RRMB): </em></strong><em>If <strong>ONE</strong> of your referrals makes $100 a day, you  as a sponsor also get paid $100 the same day. That is a whopping $100 x 30 Days  = $3000 a month. That&rsquo;s just with one referral! Imagine if you have 10  referrals earning $100 a day each. That equals to $30,000 a month. Your  potential earnings are limitless! </em></p>
                          <p>
                            <strong><em>Q) Do I need to be qualified to receive 100% RRMB?</em></strong><br />
                            <em>A) No you do not! You may start receiving 100% RRMB on  your first referral.</em></p>
                          <p><strong><em>Q) What  does Residual ON and OFF mean?</em></strong><br />
                              <em>A)</em><em> All affiliates start their month with the residual default button on  the &lsquo;Residual On&rdquo; mode. Affiliates will be able to track their organization and  view the &ldquo;Residual On&rdquo; income for the next month and make a decision to keep &ldquo;Residual  On&rdquo; mode or &ldquo;Residual Off&rdquo; mode. Must make decision 7 days before their monthly  renewal date.</em></p>
                              <p><strong><em>Q) What is the best way to build your organization? </em></strong><br />
                              <em>A) You want to first build a team of 4 direct referrals and to  ensure the growth of your business, you want to build deep first before  building wide. We suggest that every affiliate help their first 4 direct  affiliates get their 4 affiliates each before building wide. If every affiliate  does this process, the depth of your organization will explode. Remember you  earn commission to infinity depth. This is HUGE!</em></p>
                          <p><strong><em>Q) What is a rotator?</em></strong><br />
                              <em>A) Every affiliate has their own individual  rotator. The rotator is used to help your referrals and to ensure growth of  your organization, if you help your referrals you earn more commissions.<strong> </strong></em><em>Rotators  allow you to promote your multiple URLs from just one rotator URL. You can add  several websites (referral websites) to your rotator URL and then you can point  all of the traffic you get from various sources to your one rotator URL, which  will spread the traffic between you and your referrals' websites.</em></p>
                          <p><strong><em>Q) Why and when would I use my rotator?</em></strong><br />
                              <em>A) Remember  building deep first is the most important and working as a team. Remember you  want to help your 4 affiliates get their 4 affiliates each, then you continue  building wide. Here is an example of using the rotator; If you have 2 of your 4  direct affiliates that did not get their 4 referrals each. You need to add  their site url to your rotator and this will definitely help them get their 4  referrals each. There is no stopping wealth if everyone works together.</em><br />

                              <strong><em>Navigator</em></strong><em> enables you to earn 500 travel points every time you  earn a $150 commission and 500 travel points in 100% RRMB.</em></p>

                          <p><strong>APPI Travels Ltd Policy</strong></p>
                            <p>APPI Travels Ltd has  a no tolerance spam policy. Any customer found to be using APPI Travels Ltd for  spam will be immediately cut-off from use of the product. If you know of or  suspect any violators, please notify us immediately at support@appitravels.com</p>
                            <p>What is Spam?</p>
                            <p>Spam is unsolicited  email also known as UCE (Unsolicited Commercial Email). By sending email to  only to those who have requested to receive it, you are following accepted  permission-based email guidelines.</p>
                            <p>What constitutes a  Preexisting business relationship?</p>
                            <p>The recipient of your  email has made a purchase, requested information, responded to a questionnaire  or a survey, or had offline contact with you.</p>
                            <p>What constitutes  consent?</p>
                            <p>The recipient of your  email has been clearly and fully notified of the collection and use of his  email address and has consented prior to such collection and use. This is often  called informed consent.</p>
                            <p>Isn't there a law  against sending Spam?</p>
                            <p>The federal anti-spam  law went into effect on January 1st, 2004 and preempts all state laws. While  this new law will not stop spam, it does make most spam illegal and ultimately  less attractive to spammers. The law is specific about requirements to send  commercial email and empowers the federal government to enforce the law. The  penalties can include a fine and/or imprisonment for up to 5 years.</p>
                            <p>How APPI Travels Ltd protects  you from sending spam</p>

                            <p>Verification &ndash; APPI  Travels Ltd automatically sends all of your new contacts an email confirming  their interest in receiving emails from you. Additionally, if your contact  changes his or her interests or unsubscribes, Wealth Podium automatically sends  an email confirmation.</p>
                            <p>Unsubscribe - Every  email generated from APPI Travels Ltd contains an unsubscribe link which allows  your contacts to opt-out of future emails and automatically updates your  contact lists to avoid the chance of sending unwanted emails to visitors who  have unsubscribed.</p>
                            <p>Identification - Your  email header information is correct because it is pre-set for you by APPI  Travels Ltd. Your email's &quot;From&quot; address is verified and already  accurately identifies you as the sender.</p>
                            <p>Contact Information -  all of your emails are pre-filled with your contact information including your  physical address.</p>
                            <p>How to protect  yourself from Spam: Take the Spam Test</p>
