			<h3 class='colorCF2A0E'>Corporal Joshua Johnson:</h3>
			<p>A few years back, this name may have meant nothing to most who read it - <strong>just an anonymous military individual</strong> - but these days, <strong>Corporal Joshua Johnson</strong> is quickly gaining a reputation as one of the <strong>premier voices in the world of survivalism</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong>Corporal JJ's</strong> journey began when he started seeing the signs that indicated a worldwide catastrophe (likely along the lines of a financial collapse - the likes of which the world has never seen before) was fast approaching. Due to his years of military training and action in the United States Marine Corps, <strong>Corporal JJ</strong> felt confident in his ability to thrive in a basic survival situation. Upon studying more closely the elements likely to be involved in post-catastrophe survival, however, he realized that even he was underprepared for the situations that would be likely to arise.</p>
			<p>If he - with all his training, knowledge, experience, and expertise - were underprepared, then, how much more underprepared was the everyday civilian?</p>
			<h3 class='colorCF2A0E'>It was as a result of this realization that <strong>Corporal JJ</strong> began to build his Crisis Survival Guide.</h3>
			<p>The <strong>Crisis Survival Guide</strong> has quickly grown into one of the most trusted resources on post-catastrophe survival, with members from all over the world gaining advanced and valuable knowledge that will help them to excel in times when the rest of the world is caught up in chaos. <strong>Corporal JJ's</strong> advanced knowledge of survival tactics and techniques provides members of the <strong>Crisis Survival Guide</strong> with the sort of knowledge very few individuals will have when the impending finanical collapse crashes down upon the worldwide population, and it is through the accumulation of this knowledge that members are put in position to "thrive" at a time when all others will be focused on simply staying alive.</p>
			<p>Although <strong>Corporal JJ</strong> has invested years of his life to accumulate this valuable information and to figure out how to best implement this knowledge in case of a survival situation, he has always been known to be more interested in the dissemination of knowledge than in the profits that can be gained (after all: what good is money in the event of a financial collapse?). As such, he is currently taking the unprecedented step of releasing his Crisis Survival Guide for free.</p>
			<p>For a limited time, the <strong>Crisis Survival Guide</strong> can be <a href='/freebook/'>downloaded for FREE by CLICKING HERE</a></p>
			<p>We are at a point in history where it is no longer a question of "if" a worldwide financial collapse will happen, but is instead a question of "when." <strong>Corporal JJ's</strong> goal is to ensure that as many people as possible know how to "survive and thrive" when that day comes and the world as we know it crumbles around us. Will you be ready? Get your hands on <strong>Corporal JJ's Crisis Survival Guide</strong> today.</p>
