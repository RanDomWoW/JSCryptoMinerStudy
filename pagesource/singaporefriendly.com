<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>There are many outing spots up for exploration for those who do not have any clues. They are all safe and fun for your young nieces or nephews.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">First up on the list if Kampung Lorong Buangkok. It is a complete opposite to the usual concrete jungle scenery we face every day. It is especially educational for kids to experience pre-modernized landscape and feel the kampong air. It is situated between busy roads and skyscraper developments. It has all kampong features intact, ranging from wooden houses, vegetable patches, tin roofs and fruit trees. You can feel yourself stepping into another brand new atmosphere close to Mother Nature. Houses come with open public porches and welcoming courtyards, similar to the olden community spirits. Crime is virtually non-existent due to the strong unity among villagers, unlike modern Singapore which houses are gated and CCTV installation at every corner of the house. Spare some time for a short visit with your family. It is free for all to wander about, but be wary of residents' privacy.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">Another family outing spot could be organized at the wet markets. Children are curious about everything from simple questions such as origins of their breakfasts and source for fish and seafood. Bringing your kids to wet markets can give teach them lessons about grocery-shopping. The fruits and vegetables vendor contains the most variety of colorful plants. Fresh raw vegetable scent accompanied the kids every corner of the market. You can pay the prawn stalls a visit. Kids can have a fun time playing with worms and terrapins. Kids can relate to their friends about their exciting adventure to the market and the lessons behinds fresh poultry. Breakfast outlets can be found in the market as well which sells familiar local cuisine as what the kids had long known, namely the ever delicious Nasi Lemak or Roti Prata. It may not be a common family outing for visiting wet markets but the educational lessons are vital for the children's growth.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">Next up on the family outing list is <a target='_blank' href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/parks-and-nature-reserves/pasir-ris-park" target="_blank">Pasir Ris Boardwalk</a> along the mangrove. It is a hidden trekking gem suitable for trekkers of all age categories, including young kids. It has a dedicated stroller lane as well. Fun awaits the visitors who enjoy crab spotting. Humps could be spotted along the walk, created by lobsters on the muddy surface. Mudskippers are well camouflaged and needed more eye-power for effective detection. Once you get the hang of their hiding spots it is easy spot. Boardwalk ends with a jetty that oversees Sungai Tampines. Plenty of uncommon creature sightings can be found such as kingfishers, monitor lizard, archer fishes and water snake. Kid would love the hangout spot. It is the number one hang out spot for many families in Singapore.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Staying put at home over the weekend may be a good idea to recuperate after a busy workweek. Some households prefer maintaining an active lifestyle, especially families with boy kids who have endless energy for all adventures. Nature lovers can consider going for regular hikes at Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. 1 or 2 hours of hike will see hikers reaching TreeTop Walk. Nature lovers can enjoy the fresh and cool forest air and rest under the shady thick canopy. Singapore's nature parks are some of the best parks in world with 1st class maintenance and landscaping. National Parks had performed a great task constructing the boardwalks at MacRitchie Reservoir, allowing hikers to get close to emerald green water coming to life.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph6">Parents always worry that outing spots they have chosen may not be safe for their young kids. A place that is kid friendly need not be extremely safe, but rather places that parents can let go and allow children to get dirty while playing with mud and having joyous moments. Activities should be fun and engaging. They will learn to pick up after a hard fall. The main takeaway is to have an enjoyable moment and cherish the weekend outings together.</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>When a group visited Singapore a few years back, they had been on the road for more than &frac12; a year. By the time they reached this place at the South Eastern part of Asia, they were tired and drained already. They have spent most of their time hanging out in the malls, they were just drinking and sipping a cup of coffee while cooling down with the air-conditioning system. they have never left the downtown core.  The cash is actually running out and the hotels are so costly. They have managed to walk around and they have missed so much already. If they only knew that there are discounted hotels around online, they may have been able to fit into a few more days to enjoy and to find out what Singapore has to offer.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">They were just so amazed to know that Singapore has a lot of nature reserves and even parks that a person may check out. Who would ever though that the next most populous nation across the globe may have more natural sceneries for people to slow down a bit and have a good time with the nature.   There is just a lot of things to do and visit in Singapore. It is not just meant for shopping savvies, but it is also meant for those who love to spend the night in a bar.  There are some ideas meant for your outdoor adventure when you visit this small nation, you must be ready, because it is filled with all the adventures and activities that you could ever asked for.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">First thing you can do upon arriving in Singapore is to check some of the rock climbing facilities. There are lots of it in this part of Asia. In fact, the old Bukit Timah Quarries is one of the most popular. There are more than fifty routes to challenge you and that ranges from the simple to the hardest routes. Rock climbing is quite new in this country, but a lot of people are now enjoying it.  Another activity is wake boarding. This is not just famous, but the cable ski park as well. It seems like it is by far one of the best method to learn the new tricks using a board. You will be pulled around in a lagoon using a cable. It will be more affordable than renting a boat and then it will be available for around 8 riders that can be on the same cable one at a time, that will give you a lot of time into the water.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">Paragliding is another activity, it is also available in Peru and in Nepal, however, they are more expensive. They are not really budget friendly. Probably, Singapore will be among the places that will surely become famous in this activity. There is a new adventure travel world of Singapore where you can try paragliding.  Who doesn't know ziplining?  The <a target='_blank' href="http://sg.megaadventure.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Mega zip</strong></a> park in Singapore is an outdoor activity area to make your adrenalin rush for the day.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph5">You will go through the jungle canopy, mini bungee jump and rock climbing all at once with the zipline.  If you are not a fan of bungee jumping and other activities, then you can try the zipline. It is more than fifty feet high, that made it known as the Mega Zip. You can also check out the Mount Faber Park. They have made this one perfect with all the beautiful views around. This is a nine-kilometer-wide park with greeneries around.
