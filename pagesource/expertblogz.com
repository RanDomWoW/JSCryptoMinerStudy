  <span class="author">by <a href="/author/iExpert.aspx">ExpertBlogger</a></span>

  <div class="text"><p>It is not that long when I was shopping for holidays and cash counter the cashier were just having general conversation and he asked me that did you see bitcoin it is going to touch 20k, I said yes but &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that imaginary and very volatile&rdquo; I said he said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; but he was looking happy, &ldquo;Do you have any?&rdquo; I asked, he said yes I have and I am going to buy more, I was imagining that he Is cashier and who earn his money working hard and he is putting that money into something probably he don&rsquo;t understand. May be some has told him that this is good investment to grow your money. Now after 2 months when I saw bitcoin rate, it reminded me of that cashier and I was thinking that what would have happen to his hard earned money, does he sold in time or he was waiting for price to go up and now his investment is cut into half.</p>
<p>I was reading about cryptocurrency and I was bit skeptical that should go for it or not, one of my friend suggested that you should buy some but again I said I don&rsquo;t have strong heart that I can stand if I lose all my money in just couple of hours. There might been some different point of view looking at it but if you apply fundamental of investment that if you are taking highest possible risk to make highest money in small time then you should be strong enough to handle any situation which you have to face may be this could be good or bad. But again when we look at crypto this not regulated if you have lot of money and you lose there is no one who can take responsibility of that.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="float: left;" src="/image.axd?picture=2018%2f2%2fb.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>According to many analysts this is something driving by the speculation and interest of people in something new and everyone is looking for making quick bucks and run out of this , they still think that our economy is not mature enough to handle this type of alternative currency and trade in day todays activities , when someone say it is currency then it should have some fixed value which someone cash in but rather that everyone use it as some kind of equity stock where there is not actual value for buying but we are just investing on the speculated value.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know that in the long term this might pick up or stables but at this point analysts only saying that some people made lot of money overnight and some people lost lot of money those who earn they are happy they are keeping their profits and again betting for good time to come.</p>
<p>Crypto can go in any direction it not even advice that be away from that because you might lose something which will be great down the line after 5 years but analysts fair advice it don&rsquo;t do over of anything and just like alternative word to this currency, your investment should be like yet another alternative.&nbsp;</p>

  <span class="author">by <a href="/author/iExpert.aspx">ExpertBlogger</a></span>
  <span class="pubDate">2. January 2018 10:52</span>
  
  <div class="text"><p>New Year is already here and everyone has welcomed New Year with joy and fresh resolution for coming year, it is always amazing to welcome New Year with fresh attitude and new perspective, looking at what we have done wrong in past year and correcting those mistake and doing better in coming days.</p>
<p>We always take a resolution for yourself and at this new year when we entering into 2018 we wish that people should consider and take up things which are generally overlooked we should take resolution to take make this world a better place and think that how we can make our contribution to the society in term of helping those who are in need and giving them level field to compete in this competitive world.</p>
<p>So this New Year talk take up resolution to do some social work or community work. Spend you valuable time with people who do not have anybody around , visit places where humanity still exists and finally to some charity which will help those next generation for better tomorrow , and when you are doing this have you kids with you because that is most important thing because you need to pass these values to next generation and your kids will learn this great thing you are doing and encourage them to care about society and increase their social awareness which is most important thing to have.</p>
<p>We have seen that these days people are connected through digital media but in really they are socially so much apart that it is very difficult to do social interaction as everybody feels like it is the last thing they need to consider and believe me this gap is just going to increase in coming days and we have huge responsibility in our hand to teach our kids that , this is not just you matters , this is us , people around us makes us social and responsible. If we could not do this then we will be living in isolated world in crowded city.</p>
<p>This New Year let look around and try to do thing which we are missing in this digital world, give time to real people rather than phone calls and video call. Feel the real touch and hold the hand who need you hand because at the end you take nothing with you it is your memories and how people see you when you are gone.</p>
<p>And lastly have Great Year ahead!!</p></div>

  <span class="author">by <a href="/author/iExpert.aspx">ExpertBlogger</a></span>
  <span class="pubDate">6. December 2017 16:24</span>
  
  <div class="text"><p>Holiday&rsquo;s such as nice word to hear, when you hear about holidays then you feel so relaxed and you would like to cheer and enjoy every moment of this, we can meet to friends and family. Share good bad in the year and finally welcome brand new year for new beginning</p>
<p>In the holiday seasons along with fun there is another important thing everyone does is shopping , yes tones and tones of shopping which start with thanks giving holidays and ends with I mean it does not really end but kind of stop at new year&rsquo;s. I personally visit many store during this festival season and this article about to share my experiences. not to mention all the store and online shop they start their holiday preparation well ahead of time right from hiring new extra employees, ordering all the goods and making sure that infrastructure will run and have enough backup plans because they cannot afford to have anything stop for even for hour, the impact that can have on their sales will be huge.</p>
<p>Now talking about shopping there are many thinks which surprise me, I mean the amount of discount they offer while this period is insane. Something I think if they can afford to sell any item at that price then what about the people who bought that same item in other time of year at the high price are those are fools. On the other hand some good and articles has almost same price as year around but people just think that this is holiday time and all things are on sale so this is cheap and they tends to buy everything they can. Every time person goes in the store to buy one thing and end up purchasing other items just because it holiday season, also this season is gifting season keeping that in mind all stores designs their product in terms of gifting solutions. And advertise them so hard that they kind of divert one&rsquo;s mind to go and buy the goods if someone has not thought of buying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometime it just amaze me the enthusiasm of people about shopping in heavy winter , standing in those long lines , for some people it&rsquo;s fun for some people its thrill and some its experience which they want to enjoy. Every online website is filled with deals and promotion and that what make people eyes to want it. Overall I think alone in this 2 months people must be spending almost double amount they spend in entire year.</p>
<p>So If you are shopping be smart rather than wasting your time from store to store and use technology , look out for your finance and&nbsp; make your holiday shopping experience better than before.</p></div>

  <h1><a href="/post/2017/11/02/Knowledge-is-power-then-college-degree-is-essential.aspx" class="taggedlink">Knowledge is power then college degree is essential </a></h1>
  <span class="author">by <a href="/author/iExpert.aspx">ExpertBlogger</a></span>
  <span class="pubDate">2. November 2017 14:28</span>
  
  <div class="text"><p>Knowledge is power and so is the degree behind that knowledge. A degree from a good institute plays a pivotal role in one&rsquo;s career. A good institute not only is responsible for shaping the future of its students but also ensures that each student succeed in their respective lives. A degree from a university leads to better prospects of employment which in turn gives way to the economic growth and more civilized societies. Choosing a good college or university is a herculean task in itself. There are several factors to be kept in mind before one could enroll in a university.</p>
<p>Some of the things one should consider before opting for a college are:</p>
<p>a.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>A proper research should be done for a college in the field where one aspires to get a degree. Gather facts and figures about different colleges and short list a few of them.</p>
<p>b.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Browse through these short-listed colleges and get more details about them by going through their websites. If required do inquires with the university support staff and take relevant information.</p>
<p>c.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The college campuses are the most important factor for a student to go for any college. The campus comprises library, laboratories, sports facilities, accommodation etc. Another factor is the types of courses offered by the college and that they suit a candidate&rsquo;s preferences.</p>
<p>d.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Admission fee is the next most important factor to go for a college. Some premier colleges offer good scholarships to the students based on the merit. For others the banks provide the educational loan to the students.</p>
<p>e.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Annual fee should be taken into consideration by the candidate as it will decide the next course of action for gathering the funds for the admission. The family income bracket in which an individual falls in, shall decide the state or federal grant/loan given to a candidate for college degree.</p>
<p>f.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Another important factor to be measured is the graduation rate of a college. This means the difference of the number of students enrolled in a particular year and the number of students from them pass out with a degree should be minimum. More the graduates from a particular university or a college in a year, higher will be the graduation rate and this ensures that the college is worth a go. Usually the accredited universities should be short listed those which are recognized by the state and provide superior education.</p>
<p>g.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The ultimate aim of a college degree is to get a better job opportunity and hence a higher income. While deciding for a college the placement ratio post the graduation should be considered too. In case of the federal loans availed for attaining the university degree post college income matters the most in order to repay the debts.</p>
<p>h.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Admission rate is also a parameter that decides a candidate&rsquo;s entry into that college or university. Admission rate refers to the number of applicants that are admitted in that college or university. The college with stringent criteria poses more competition before the candidates and hence results in the intake of cr&egrave;me-de-la-cr&egrave;me lot.</p>
<p>The admission criteria of almost all colleges includes a minimum score of GPA , a cut-off score of the entrance test and some more requirements to be met that varies from institute to institute and also courses taken , depending upon an institutes's acceptance rate.</p>
<p>i.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Student to teacher ratio is one crucial determinant for a college to be called as a good college. Bigger class sizes lead to divided attention of the teacher among larger group of students. Smaller class size ensures more focused teacher student interaction and bonding.</p>
<p>j.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The practical implementation of the theory that is taught in a college is most important for a student. The intern ships offered by a university or a college is a good start of a successful career. Secondly the hands-on and practical sessions conducted by the institutes empower the students with real time situations how to face them better.</p>
<p>k.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Lastly , the career defining counselling provided by the institute in order to guide the students about the plethora of opportunities that lay before them in the outside world.</p>
<p>The selection process of a college to attain a graduation degree is instrumental in a person&rsquo;s career and financial growth.</p></div>

  <h1><a href="/post/2017/10/07/Finding-Best-Mortgage-Its-an-art-!!!.aspx" class="taggedlink">Finding Best Mortgage, It's an art !!!</a></h1>
  <span class="author">by <a href="/author/iExpert.aspx">ExpertBlogger</a></span>

  <div class="text"><p>Getting a home is a dream of every living organism on the earth, be it an animal, a bird or a human being. This is a dream for a common man to buy a house for himself/herself and the family in today&rsquo;s times when the rates of the property and the interests on the home loans are sky hiking. To get the best deal from the floating deals in the market is a big task for a property investor and to end up with a profitable deal that can ensure minimum interest rate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many pre requisites of striking a good deal in the home buying and selling market. The most important of which is the mortgage option that should be calculated appropriately before opting for it. Apart from this a good credit score, a reserved amount for the down payment and a good lender.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss some point which can be borne in mind before taking a step forward towards the dream property:</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>A small down payment can suffice for buying the property, unlike the popular notion of paying 20% of the cost to the builder/owner which lenders mostly tell the buyers. For e.g. as part of rural development the US government zero-down mortgages in order to uplift the poor.</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The buyers who do not have a perfect credit score for buying the house can opt for government insured lending schemes.</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The lender&rsquo;s job is to calculate the minimum reserve needed to qualify for a mortgage. A lender&rsquo;s duty is to ensure that in order to make a down payment the buyer&rsquo;s savings should not exhaust and there should remain some reserve for the times to come and contingency needs.</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>If the credit score falls less than the 20 percent down payment amount then the buyer is asked to go for the mortgage insurance that may lead to higher payments for the property.</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The mortgage insurance is an overhead till the loan is paid. However to get rid of it one can refinance the load if he/she wants under certain special circumstances.</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>During the mortgage the debtor will be asked by the lender to pay all the closing costs of the mortgage which will ensure into the low rate of interest, however in doing so the credit score of the debtor will go down and hence leading to the mortgage insurance. One should be careful in opting for all the options at the time of mortgage.</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>To get a good mortgage deal the buyer/debtor should keep a low profile while the mortgage is being processed , being said that , all the credit cards / spending trends etc. should not be made or made only if absolutely necessary. During the lenders survey the spending activities of the buyer if surfaces, then the possibility of the mortgage to be nullified or get cancelled is higher.</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Another most important factor that people ignore is availing the veteran loan. Serving the nation or retired nationals both can avail the benefits on the mortgage under Veteran scheme.</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>A good mortgage broker can give you a plethora of options to buy the best loan without being biased of his/her products. Go for a licensed mortgage broker, that can give you access to the maximum options in least time interval.</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>In order to get a good credit score, one should start clearing his debts or any outstanding money to be paid before going for the mortgage. The ideal credit score of 700 credits gives a buyer an upper hand in buying a good loan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>With good credit score one should also focus on a fairly good cash reserve. A good cash reserve is measured in terms of the number of months one can make the house payment in cash. This will help in positioning the buyer in a better place to get the best deal on the mortgage.</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Never go for a mortgage without comparing it with other deals in the market.</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Lastly, try to figure out as for how long you&rsquo;ll be in the house that you plan to buy. If in the long run one decides to sell it off then mortgage rates can be adjusted. The adjustable rate mortgages offer low interest rates and also low initial down payments. However, when the interest rates will start to leap, these ARM&rsquo;s would create a problem to the buyer with increase costs on the loan.</p>
<p>One must be judicious in going for the perfect mortgage scheme based on his/her requirements and long and short term benefits, always look at your need and keep in mind demand and supply structure for your targeted areas.</p></div>
