        <p><i>Why was this site created?</i><br>JackinChat was created to give adults a place to discuss masturbation and other sexuality related topics with other adults in a fun, interactive way. You can chat with other adults through the live chat, or post messages on the various forums of the messageboard. We at JackinChat think sex and masturbation are fun and exciting topics to talk to others about in an uninhibited and open manner.</p>
        <p><i>Who is the intended audience of JackinChat?</i><br>JackinChat is targetted to any adult (strictly those 18 and older), man or woman, straight, gay or bi who enjoy the act of self-pleasure. Masturbation is a natural and day-to-day part of many adult lives yet many people don't have access to others who wish to share or discuss such topics. JackinChat is here to give adults that chance.</p>
        <p><i>Does JackinChat cost anything to use?</i><br>JackinChat and all its services are 100% free. We do not flood you with pop-ups and intrusive advertising either.</p>
        <p><i>Are we only allowed to talk about masturbation?</i><br>No, of course not! We don't have strict rules about what people can and cannot discuss. Just like any chatroom on the net people are free to chat about whatever may be on their minds as long as it is not in violation of the Terms of Service. JackinChat just provides a cool, open, and honest atmosphere for chat.</p>
        <p><i>If I have any more questions, who can I contact?</i><br>Feel free to send an e-mail to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ceb9abaca3afbdbaabbc8ea4afada5a7a0ada6afbae0ada1a3">[email&#160;protected]</a> with any questions about the site you might have.</p>
