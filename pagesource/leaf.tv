occurs at 6:12am PST in the mutable water sign of Pisces, helping to usher in the first signs of Spring. What is a New Moon? A New Moon occurs when the Moon and the Sun share the same path and the Moon is casted in shadow, itâ€™s face hidden from view. This creates a dark sky and is the commencement of a new lunar cycle. What does the New Moon represent? The New Moon is the first phase in the Lunar Cycle.</div></div></div></div><div data-count="1" class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 articles-cards__item"><div class="card-article-wrapper card-article-wrapper--is-featured"><a href="/13711093/6-tips-to-dealing-with-acne-that-actually-work/" title="6 Tips To Dealing With Acne That Actually Work" class="image"><img src="https://img.leafcdn.tv/360x385/ppds/f0980d58-f448-4888-a4ef-49534c1394d1.jpg" alt="6 Tips To Dealing With Acne That Actually Work" class="360x385"><span class="image-overlay image-overlay--read">Read</span></a><div class="info"><h3 class="subcategory category--dress-up"><a href="/dress-up/diy-beauty">DIY Beauty</a></h3><h2 class="title"><a href="/13711093/6-tips-to-dealing-with-acne-that-actually-work/" title="6 Tips To Dealing With Acne That Actually Work" style="-moz-box-orient: vertical; -webkit-box-orient: vertical; box-orient: vertical;">6 Tips To Dealing With Acne That Actually Work</a></h2><div class="summary" style="-moz-box-orient: vertical; -webkit-box-orient: vertical; box-orient: vertical;">Anyone who has struggled with acne knows that it can be debilitating on so many levels.

Frankly, it sucks. BUT, it's not impossible to get to where you want to be!!!! This I promise you. I've tried everything and spoken to some of the biggest experts in the beauty space to find solutions that work.</div></div></div></div><div data-count="2" class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 articles-cards__item"><div class="card-article-wrapper card-article-wrapper--is-featured"><a href="/13711010/3-one-pan-breakfast-ideas-for-an-easy-morning/" title="3 One Pan Breakfast Ideas For An Easy Morning" class="image"><img src="https://img.leafcdn.tv/360x385/ppds/b31a3cd8-f85d-496a-8025-91ab252bdb80.jpg" alt="3 One Pan Breakfast Ideas For An Easy Morning" class="360x385"><span class="image-overlay image-overlay--read">Read</span></a><div class="info"><h3 class="subcategory category--eat-well"><a href="/eat-well/breakfast">Breakfast</a></h3><h2 class="title"><a href="/13711010/3-one-pan-breakfast-ideas-for-an-easy-morning/" title="3 One Pan Breakfast Ideas For An Easy Morning" style="-moz-box-orient: vertical; -webkit-box-orient: vertical; box-orient: vertical;">3 One Pan Breakfast Ideas For An Easy Morning</a></h2><div class="summary" style="-moz-box-orient: vertical; -webkit-box-orient: vertical; box-orient: vertical;">If you're looking for a hearty, protein-rich breakfast that you can cook with fresh ingredients and eat warm on the spot, but without all the hassle of cookware and plates, you can still whip up a satisfying dish that requires washing only one pan after use. That's not so bad, right?

Most of the chatter in the office was about the same thing, as soon as we re-emerged from the holiday break. In an effort to break the cycle of "treat yourself" and my terrible sugar addiction, I wanted something more sustainable than a quick 5 day cleanse . Something that could truly change my cravings and the way I thought about food. Even though I'm the editor of a wellness site, that doesn't mean I don't love me some french fries and chocolate cake. I had heard so many success stories around the Clean Program's 21 Day Cleanse , but was pretty terrified to try it (I've never eliminated anything from my diet for that long, I generally stick to "everything in moderation").</div></div></div></div><div data-count="6" class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 articles-cards__item"><div class="card-article-wrapper"><a href="/13711002/the-easy-turmeric-tonic-that-will-heal-your-muscles/" title="The Easy Turmeric Tonic That Will Heal Your Muscles" class="image"><img src="https://img.leafcdn.tv/500x281/ppds/4b2ac6e0-af7a-4c78-905e-a159d1b80a2c.jpg" alt="The Easy Turmeric Tonic That Will Heal Your Muscles" class="500x281"><span class="image-overlay image-overlay--read">Read</span></a><div class="info"><h3 class="subcategory category--eat-well"><a href="/eat-well/healthy-drinks">Healthy Drinks</a></h3><h2 class="title"><a href="/13711002/the-easy-turmeric-tonic-that-will-heal-your-muscles/" title="The Easy Turmeric Tonic That Will Heal Your Muscles" style="-moz-box-orient: vertical; -webkit-box-orient: vertical; box-orient: vertical;">The Easy Turmeric Tonic That Will Heal Your Muscles</a></h2><div class="summary" style="-moz-box-orient: vertical; -webkit-box-orient: vertical; box-orient: vertical;">By now, you're probably aware of the major anti-inflammatory benefits of turmeric root.
