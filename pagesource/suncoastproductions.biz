<P>
These Terms and
Conditions and all matters arising out of or otherwise relating to
these Terms and Conditions shall be governed by the laws of the
 United States, excluding its conflict of law provisions. The parties
agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application
to these Terms and Conditions. The parties hereby submit to the
personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of the United
States. Exclusive venue for any litigation or arbitration permitted
under this Agreement shall be with the state and federal courts
located in Seminole County, Florida and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 

</P>
<P>
<B>Rights to
Injunctive Relief</B></P>
<P>
Both
parties acknowledge that remedies at law may be inadequate to provide
an aggrieved party with full compensation in the event of the other
party’s breach, and that an aggrieved party shall therefore be
entitled to seek injunctive relief in the event of any such breach,
in addition to seeking all other remedies available at law or in
equity. 
</P>
<P>
<BR>
</P>
<P>
Binding
Arbitration</B> 
</P>
<P>
If
there is a dispute between the parties arising out of or otherwise
relating to these Terms and Conditions, the parties shall meet and
negotiate in good faith to attempt to resolve the dispute. Arbitral
Claims shall include, but are not limited to, contract and tort
claims of all kinds, and all claims based on any federal, state or
local law, statute, or regulation, excepting only claims under
applicable worker’s compensation law and unemployment insurance
claims. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute through
direct negotiations, then, except as otherwise provided herein,
either party may submit the issue to binding arbitration in
accordance with  the then-existing Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall be conducted
in Seminole County, Florida and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and
conducted by a single arbitrator, knowledgeable in Internet and
e-Commerce. The party bringing the action shall be responsible for
paying all costs for arbitration, including the arbitrator’s fees.
Each party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees (except if the matter
is for the collection of a debt owed in which case the prevailing
party shall be awarded its attorneys fees, all arbitration costs and
the arbitrator fees (if applicable), in addition to all other
applicable remedies). The arbitrator shall have no authority to award
any punitive or exemplary damages; certify a class action; add any
parties; vary or ignore the provisions of these Terms and Conditions;
and shall be bound by governing and applicable law. The arbitrator
shall render a written opinion setting forth all material facts and
the basis of his or her decision within thirty (30) days of the
conclusion of the arbitration proceeding. This Section shall not
apply to any breach (or any allegation which if true would constitute
a breach) of any matter relating to intellectual property. THE
PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
REGARD TO ARBITRAL CLAIMS.

Conditions nor any rights granted hereunder may be sold, leased,
assigned or otherwise transferred, in whole or in part by you.

</P>
<P>
<B>Severability</B></P>
<P>
If for any reason a
court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator finds any provision
of these Terms and Conditions, or any portion thereof, to be
unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent
permissible and the remainder of these Terms and Conditions will
continue in full force and effect. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
<B>Attorney’s Fees</B></P>

attorney’s fees incurred on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
<BR>
</P>
<P>
<B>No Waiver</B></P>
<P>
No waiver shall be
deemed a waiver of any subsequent default of the same provision of
these Terms and Conditions. If any term, clause or provision hereof
is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect the validity or
operation of any other term, clause or provision and such invalid
term, clause or provision shall be deemed to be severed from these
Terms and Conditions.

<P>This

demonstrate our company's commitment to privacy. The following
discloses our information gathering and disseminating practices. This
Policy also instructs you on what procedures to take if you do not
want to receive communications from us other than those required for
account maintenance. <BR>Personally
– Identifiable Information</B></P>
<P>We
use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, and
to administer the Website. Your IP address is used to help identify
you and to gather broad demographic information. Our site may require
Members &amp; Studios to give us contact information (such as email
addresses and phone numbers), financial information (this includes
account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (this
includes zip code, age and income level). We use contact information
to send the user information needed to maintain their studio &amp; or
membership account, to contact them when necessary, and to notify
them of news about our company. We also use customer contact
information to send the user promotional material from some of our
partners. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (other than
those required for account administration); see the opt-out section
below. The financial information collected is used to check the
users' qualifications and to bill the user for services ordered.
Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We may
use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing
them content that we think they might be interested in, and
displaying the content according to their preferences. This
information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis only.
From time to time, our site may request additional information from
users via promotional programs or special offers. Participation in
these offers is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a
choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information
requested may include contact information such as phone numbers and
address. This information may be used to award gifts and promotional
products.

to administer our Web site. We use aggregate information along with
other data to make improvements and update to our site for our
visitors. We may provide aggregate statistics about our customers,
sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable
third-party vendors. However, these statistics will not include
personal identifying information. Account information may be released
when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably
necessary to: (1) comply with applicable law, regulation or subpoena;
(2) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements; or (3)
protect the rights, property or safety of our users and/or any third
parties. <BR>Sharing
of Information</B></P>
<P>The
Website does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you
with any third party, except to the financial institution that
processes your transaction or where required by law. If our company
goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired
by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, members
personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets
transferred. If as a result of the business transition, the members

of information include the type of Internet browser you are using,
the type of computer operating system you are using, and the domain
