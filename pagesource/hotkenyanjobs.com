<p>Organization: Action Against Hunger USA<br />
Country: Kenya<br />
Closing date: <span class="date-display-single">30 Mar 2018</span></p>
<p><strong>VACANCY ANNOUNCEMENT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Name of the position</strong>: <strong>Livelihood Program Manager</strong></p>
<p><strong>Country: Kenya</strong></p>
<p><strong>Base:</strong> Samburu </p>
<p><strong>Direct line manager</strong>: Head of Base</p>
<p><strong>Line management of:</strong> Program Officers</p>
<p><strong>Starting date:</strong></p>
<p>As soon as possible</p>
<p><strong>Contract Duration</strong>: 1 Year</p>
<p>Founded in 1979, Action Against Hunger is an international humanitarian organization that delivers programs in over 44 countries. Recognized worldwide as a leader in the fight against hunger, our mission is to save lives through the prevention, detection, and treatment of malnutrition, especially during and after emergency situations and conflicts. From crisis to sustainability, Action Against Hunger tackles the underlying causes of malnutrition and its effects. By integrating our programs with local and national systems, we further ensure that short-term interventions become long-term solutions. With head offices in France, the United Kingdom, Spain, the United States and Canada, our international network shares its combined resources, breadth of experience and technical expertise in pursuit of a world without hunger. </p>
<p>Action Against Hunger has been present in Kenya since 2001 and is a <strong>transformative leader in nutrition security</strong> for improved quality of life among vulnerable communities. Action Against Hunger wants to <strong>contribute to the optimal functional performance of National, County, and Community systems</strong> through strategic partnerships for <strong>innovative</strong> nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific interventions to achieve its impact. Action Against Hunger is currently implementing activities in West Pokot, Mandera, Samburu, Isiolo, Trans Nzoia, Kakamega, Bungoma and Busia counties.</p>
<p>To achieve this, Action Against Hunger will;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Intervene on the Health and Nutrition sector: evolving from direct service provision to strengthening the health system- focusing on ‘strengthening’ the system more than ‘supporting’ the system</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Action Against Hunger-Kenya health and nutrition program has considerably evolved from direct service provision, to scaling up the relationship and partnership with the Ministry of Health (MoH) by recognizing them as the primary health and nutrition service providers and working at building their technical capacity to reach a higher level in the quality of services provided. Strengthening the health system will not happen by indiscriminately working on the six (6) HSS pillar alone but through a critical and holistic review of the health system processes. This critical and holistic diagnostic approach requires having developed a trustful relationship to be able to work together with the health departments, at national, County and sub-county levels</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bringing the Community Health Strategy (CHS) onboard</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Within the HSS approach, ACF-Kenya will focus on community health strategy (CHS) as CHS has the potential to have a huge impact on addressing under-nutrition and is, unfortunately, under-utilized. Through this system, Action Against Hunger-Kenya will work with the MoH to create demand and accountability for services offered. This will be achieved through</p>
<ol>
<li>Applying SBCC approach at community level</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthen referral and counter referral system </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scaling up community/citizen engagement</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the system on which Action Against Hunger is supporting is not properly connected to people and there is inadequate engagement with people themselves then results will not be achieved. Deciders are still making crucial decisions on behalf of their citizen and on what they think should be the strategies and the priorities. The most vulnerable groups lack strong voice to advocate for their priorities thus the requirement for an engagement platform. </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sustainability of WASH services to strengthen nutrition sensitive programming</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Nutrition sensitive programming remains key to achieving better nutrition impact and reaching targets. WASH is a vital element but the main problem in Kenya is about sustainable access to safe water and sanitation services to withstand the recurrent shocks in ASAL regions. Findings clearly demonstrate critical role of WASH in good nutrition require long-term sustainable solutions for the vulnerable communities embedded in the existing systems and communities </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Partnerships</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The position holder Will aim to work closely with the Ministry of Health both at National and County levels to support in the implementation of the National and County level strategies related to improving maternal Infant and Young Child Nutrition (MIYCN) and building relationships with key stakeholders including within government institutions, the donor community, NGOs and the private sector. </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Research</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Research will be aimed at informing program action by building rigorous high quality evidence. Thus, Action Against Hunger will seek to contextualise research findings within the larger health and Nutrition strategy. Research will always be of high quality in order to produce knowledge that is applicable outside of the research setting. Results of the research will also be used to improve programming and inform policy and strategies at the National and County level.</p>
<p><strong>Roles and Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p><strong>1:</strong> <strong>Implementation of the FS programme</strong> <strong>program at community level</strong>.**</p>
<p>· Define the communities and areas of interventions together with the overall technical team (Nut/FSL/Wash)</p>
<p>· Formulate the programme approach according to the project proposals and the project objectives;</p>
<p>· Formulate the hand-over/exit strategies;</p>
