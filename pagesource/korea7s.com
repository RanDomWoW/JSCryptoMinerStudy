<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>A recent online post has been published criticizing rapper San E and his manager for their ill-mannered behavior. In response to this post, San E posted a lengthy apology letter via <a target='_blank' href="https://www.facebook.com/sanethebigboy" target="_blank">Facebook</a> in hope of defusing the rumors.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">In his post, San E apologized for the misunderstanding that arose at the festival and for making fans wait for his performance.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">The rapper wrote, "This is the first time something like this happened and I'm not very good with my words.... The things I write below are the truth that I remember and I will only speak the truth. If you read until the end, thank you."</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">San E continued, "I want to start off by apologizing to the audience who were waiting out in the cold. According to my agency (Brand New Music), they had already informed the reps of Owl Festival that because of a performance before, I would be able to arrive by 12 AM. I was told [by my agency] that this would be okay. And to confirm, my agency reminded them again two days prior [to the festival date] that I would be arriving by 12 AM and asked if there were any issues with it. After calculating the distance and the speed limit, we told the festival reps beforehand that it would be impossible to arrive before 12 AM. The festival reps confirmed and said they will run the event so that there would be no gap until [my] performance."</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">"In their second written post, it said that Brand New Music had told [the festival reps] on the day of the festival that we would be able to arrive by 11:05 PM. But even when I thought about it, 11:05 PM seemed impossible. It wasn't even 11:10 or 11:15. To think that the agency had irrationally cut down one hour [of traveling time]...... I called my agency multiple times to see if there had been any miscommunication. My agency told me that they had informed the festival that it would be impossible to arrive at that time."</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">Apart from denying that he had been late without notice, the rapper stated that he was unaware that there were fans waiting just for his performance and that because of his absence, the festival had come to a temporary halt.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">He said, "I deeply regret that I wasn't able to perform my whole set for those who just wanted to enjoy the performance regardless of the situation and had to wait. If I had known that there were so many people waiting just for me, I would have canceled the DJ set and would have gone on stage with MR. No matter how many times I think about it, if I knew [how people were waiting], with my personality, I would have just gone up."</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8">San E said he is a professional rapper and as such he takes his performances very seriously. He explained that if he had known about the situation, he would have abandoned his planned DJ set.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">He continued, &ldquo;I'm sure everyone would be the same, but I also take the stage seriously every time I perform. There was not one performance I did half-heartedly, so I've very sensitive before my performances and only want the best from the team that I perform with.&rdquo;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10">He added regretfully: "I remember very clearly, I was in a very good mood because of the responsive crowd in Gumi. And when I arrived [at the festival], I signed autographs and took pictures with the people inside just like any other time. I read [on the post] that I was screaming and cursing... but from what I remember exactly, other than the normal greeting words, I did not communicate with any of the staff members. I also read that I had my earphones in and was ignoring the staff... The performance and the crowd are the most important so once I arrive and have done my initial greeting, I listen to my music and focus on warming up. And when everything is done, I finish up giving autographs and take pictures with the people. So how can you say I was ignoring..."</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph11">He continued explaining that he was only informed about the situation by his manager right before he went on stage, so he felt really bad for the audience and that is why he threw the jacket he was wearing into the crowd, in a way to try and make up for it.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph12">He continued, "In the midst of my performance someone sent in a report and the police came and stopped the performance. I was also bewildered [when this happened] and when I was getting into the car, I asked, 'What is going on?' This was the first time something like this has ever happened. I was angry and firmly told the agency that if they were going to have the performance end like this, then they might as well not have scheduled it."</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph13">The rapper then addressed the writer personally and said, "When I read the post, it seemed like rather than communicating with me, the person had gotten mad after having friction with my manager and the DJ. First and foremost, there was a problem and if you had gotten angry because of what happened, I apologize. The things that you have mentioned, I will be more wary of the actions of my team as well as mine. I bow my head once again and apologize for the situation."</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>Entertainment service providers are putting all their bets on South Korean content to expand their reach, boosting the cultural clout of region's fourth-largest economy.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2"><a target='_blank' href="https://www.netflix.com" target="_blank">Netflix</a> is just the latest entertainment service provider to jump on the bandwagon. The service provider announced an original 12-episode drama series that will be adapted from a popular South Korean online comic series.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">The announcement came after the company revealed its content creation budget for 2017 amounts to $6 billion, topping a projected $4.3 billion at <a target='_blank' href="http://www.nbcuniversal.com/" target="_blank">NBCUniversal</a>, parent company of <a target='_blank' href="https://www.cnbc.com" target="_blank">CNBC</a>.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">&ldquo;The Korean content category is becoming vital... it has high production value and the content travels,&rdquo; said Vivek Couto, executive director of consultants Media Partners Asia.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">This move opens the Asian market for Netflix as major consumers of South Korean cultural exports include Southeast Asia and greater China. Netflix entered Asia in 2015 and, therefore, is rolling out original productions in the region.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">Other entertainment companies that have invested in the South Korean pop culture entertainment business include Hong Kong telecommunication giant PCCW Ltd. with its Viu streaming service and Turner Broadcasting's Oh!K subscription-based TV channel. South Korean content takes precedence in the programming on both channels that are available in various Asian countries.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">Mirae Asset Daewoo's analyst Jee-hyun Moon and Amazon Video and YouTube Red said that Netflix is not yet popular in South Korea so local content will help boost a foothold for Netflix in South Korea.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8">&ldquo;In the Hallyu (Korean Wave) trend, the major genre is drama. Films and variety shows can be popular, but the lifespans of these shows are shorter,&rdquo; said Moon.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">Netflix may also have potential in China, where South Korean pop culture is predominant despite efforts by authorities to curb performances by Korean celebrities.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10">Breaking into the world's second largest economy might be a challenge due to strict censorship laws that limit Chinese market to many foreign media players. For instance, social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are banned in the country.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph11">Despite the obstacles, Netflix hasn't given up on breaking into the Chinese market.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph12">&ldquo;The regulatory environment for foreign digital content services in China has become challenging. We now plan to license content to existing online service providers in China rather than operate our own service in China in the near term,&rdquo; Netflix said in a letter to shareholders. The company also acknowledged that licensing revenues in China will be &ldquo;modest&rdquo;.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph13">According to Moon, Netflix needs to play within the rules of the game to be the first one to take over the Chinese market once regulations are relaxed.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph14">&ldquo;Netflix wants to generate other revenue streams including that from content licensing to the Chinese platforms. If Netflix gains some brand awareness in China and other Asian countries through licensing content, they can get other opportunities in the future,&rdquo; she said.</div>
<div class="paragraph2">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="paragraph2"><a target='_blank' href="https://www.netflix.com" target="_blank">Netflix</a> is the world's leading internet entertainment service with over 109 million members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 140 million hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films.

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>South Korean writer Han Kang has become a sensation in South Korea with the publication of her books &ldquo;The Vegetarian&rdquo; and &ldquo;Human Acts&rdquo;. Published back in 2007, &ldquo;The Vegetarian&rdquo; is a slim novel that tells the story of a woman named Yeong-hye who suddenly stops eating meat. This act enrages her family and symbolizes Yeong-hye's renunciation of humanity itself, which she sees as essentially violent. As she dives deeper into her obssession with cleansing her body from meat, it becomes clear that she's trying to emulate the peaceful life of a tree; she literally transform herself into a tree. As it can be expected, this book has been compared to Kafka's Metamorphosis at many levels.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">&ldquo;The Vegetarian&rdquo; has earned praise beyond the borders of South Korea and has own the Man Booker International Prize, awarded every other year to novels from any country published in English (as it has been translated by Deborah Smith).</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">After the success of &ldquo;The Vegetarian&rdquo;, Kang published another novel that also saw the light of day in English. The novel is &ldquo;Human Acts&rdquo; and is grounded more firmly in reality than &ldquo;The Vegetarian&rdquo; although it is just as inventive, intense and provocative.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">&ldquo;Human Acts&rdquo; focuses on a tragic episode in South Korean history that saw student protesters being shot in the streets of the city of Gwangju in 1980, while others were captured and tortured by dictatorial government forces. Since the details of the tragedy were either censored or grievously downplayed by the government, many Koreans have only recently learned the full extent of the atrocities committed.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Considering the history of censorship, &ldquo;Human Acts&rdquo; is an outstanding work that requires considerable bravery. The subject matter is controversial in itself, and Kang's nonlinear, surrealistic treatment is a huge risk that ultimately gives the atrocities and the characters who endure them an emotional immediacy.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">King's fascination with bodies is palpable from the beginning. A wretched 15-year-old boy named Dong-ho helps to wash and label fast-decomposing corpses in a municipal gymnasium in Gwangju. His main worry is his school friend, who we learn to be dead on the second chapter.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">The following chapters skip forward to account for effects of the massacre on the survivors. The story also shows the perspective of a book editor who must contend with a government censor, as well as a former prisoner who is asked to reminiscence about his time in captivity, and lastly, a factory worker who lives with daily nightmares of her sufferings at the hands of Korean soldiers.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8">Kang's writing style serves to empower both stories. In &ldquo;The Vegetarian,&rdquo; Kang's talent for grotesque description served the novel's psychosexual suspense and perverse entertainment value. In &ldquo;Human Acts,&rdquo; it makes the atrocities of human-on-human violence extremely vivid.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph9">But that's not the only bold narrative risk Kang takes. There's a chapter that is told from the point of view of a dead boy who body is trapped under a pile of other dead bodies: "When they threw a straw sack over the body of the man at the very top, the tower of bodies was transformed into the corpse of some enormous, fantastical beast, its dozens of legs splayed out beneath it." Thank goodness it's just her wild imagination a book.</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">In 2010, San E won the Best Hip Hong Song Korea Music Awards for his song &ldquo;Rap Genius.&rdquo; Following that award, he became the first rapper that secured contract with JYP Entertainment, one of the big three labels in South Korea's k-pop industry.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Then <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="http://www.brandnewmusic.co.kr/artist/san-e/about">San E</a> released his first mini album dubbed &ldquo;Everybody Ready?&rdquo; in which San E collaborated with fellow JYP Entertainment artists Min, and Joo and Yeeun on the mini album.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">San E then released his single &ldquo;Tasty San&rdquo;&rdquo; that featured Min in the M Countdown music television show. A few months later, San E started another round of promotion for the single &ldquo;LoveSick&rdquo;, in which the video featured Sohee from Wonder Girls.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">San E is not like any other rapper. He uses music as an outlet. He was born in South Korea but moved to Georgia, USA, when his parents were struggling due to the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. That is what gave him a closeness to this style of music and an international sense.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8">&ldquo;I always wanted to let everybody know hip-hop is worldwide,&rdquo; said the rapper.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">He then announced his ambitious plan to release a charity single. The purpose of it all is to cross the barriers of race, culture, language and sex, alongside the collective known as Hip Hop for the World. He recorded a global anthem &ldquo;HIPHOPISHIPHOP&rdquo;.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10">Hip Hop for the World includes talented artists from four continents and is led by <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="http://www.brandnewmusic.co.kr/artist/san-e/about">San E</a>, famous for his K-Pop Hot 100 hits like &ldquo;Break-Up Dinner,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Midsummer Night's Sweetness&rdquo; and &ldquo;Body Language.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph11">&ldquo;HIPHOPISHIPHOP is my high school dream. As an immigrant, if I let my friends listen to Korean hip-hop music, they'd be like, &lsquo;They can rap in Korea?' I always wanted to let everybody know hip-hop is worldwide; it can be rap in all different languages you never heard. It took awhile to make it really happen, now here it is.&rdquo;</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>K-dramas are known for their near-perfect male leads: attractive, intelligent heirs to vast fortunes, among other positive qualities. The <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="http://program.tving.com/tvn/dokebi"><strong>K-drama Goblin</strong></a> follows in that direction, except for that they take it to the next level; they conjure a knight in shining armor who is considered by television critics to be a god.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">Critics argue that is one of they main reasons why the show has boasted record-breaking viewership since its premiere on South Korean cable channel <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="http://www.tving.com"><strong>tvN</strong></a> with production by <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="http://www.studiodragon.net">Studio Dragon</a>.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">&ldquo;We've evolved past god-like men to actual gods, who have the appearance of good-looking men,&rdquo; said culture critic Jung Duk Hyun. &ldquo;Now, their abilities surpass the realm of human strength.&rdquo;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">In the past few years, popular dramas have seen a surge in male leads who are gifted with supernatural powers.The male protagonist in 2013's I Hear Your Voice can read people's minds. The following year, My Love From the Star featured an extraterrestrial with superhuman powers of sight, hearing and speed as its romantic lead. The year after, in Another Miss Oh the male love interest was able to see the future.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">And now it's <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/tvNdokebi">Goblin's</a> turn. Based on Korean folklore about dokkaebi, a higher spiritual being who is roughly equivalent to a goblin, Goblin stars Gong Yoo as Kim Shin, a warrior who was impaled on a sword centuries ago and transformed into an immortal with endless wealth.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6"><a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tvngoblin/"><strong>Goblin</strong></a> has scored ratings as high as 12.7 % in 2016 and many critics attribute this popularity to female viewers' yearning for all-powerful make figures who can solve the problems of modern women with stressful lives. The final episode in Jan 2017 recorded an 18.7% nationwide audience making it the <strong>second highest rated drama in Korean cable television history</strong>.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">&ldquo;The realistic ideal is that two people complement each other in a relationship,&rdquo; said Choi Ji Sun, 28, a lawyer who has watched every episode of the show.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8">&ldquo;But it's easy to escape to a world where someone will come to my side at the drop of a hat, no questions asked, and provide everything. Of course, I would never expect that of my real life partner.&rdquo;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">In the show, the protagonist Ji Eun Tak, played by Kim Go Eun, is able to summon Kim Shin by just blowing out a flame.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10">The female lead is surrounded by problems, living with relatives who scorn her after the death of her mother. Kim Shin comes to her rescue to provide for her and shelter her. Although he is her knight in shining armor, she is no damsel in distress. Instead, she is strong and strives to provide for herself.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph11">&ldquo;But it's a shame she is unable to escape the Cinderella stereotype, especially when her make partner is so almighty,&rdquo; says drama critic Kim Sun Young.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph12">Their age difference has done nothing but spark the controversy as Ji is portrayed as a high school student while Kim is said to be 39 years old with the appearance of a thirty-something man.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph13">The system of fantasy blocks any guilt and allows viewers to accept, without being repulsed, the romance between a young woman and an older man, TV critic Hwang Jin Mi. &ldquo;But the image of a young girl... hanging onto a rich, thirty-something man... lingers.&rdquo;</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>Like the rest of most of the world, Television viewers in India are majorly exposed to content from American and British TV shows. The only platform that offers material other than British and American to viewers in India is <a target='_blank' href="http://www.zindagitv.in/" target="_blank"><strong>Zindagi</strong></a>, the number 1 Premium Entertainment Channel.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">With a selection of the best shows worldwide, Zindagi offers viewers a glimpse into new cultural settings while broadcasting universal emotions.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">Zindagi has launched shows from Turkey and Ukraine before, but recently it has taken a new step and introduced the blockbuster South Korean drama &ldquo;Descendants of the Sun&rdquo; for the first time on Indian television. The touching drama tells the love story of Special Force Officer (Song Joong Ki) and a surgeon (Song Hye Kyo) whose fates intermingle.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">The TV show was not only a blockbuster hit in South Korea but it also took Asia by storm, garnering immense popularity and top-ratings across the continent.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">The selection of actors had already paved the way for the finite series to succeed. The Korean heartthrob Song Joong Ki, who plays the role of a Special Force Officer, is considered to be one of Korea's hottest actors with a huge fan following across South East Asia. His choice seems ideal as the actor served in the Korean Military for two years before bagging the role in the show.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">Although Song Joong Ki was already popular in the country, the show catapulted his fame making him one of the highest paid South Korean actors.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">&ldquo;Descendants of the Sun&rdquo; is the story of Special Force Officer and a surgeon who fall in love at first sight. Despite their instant congeniality, they are taken aback by their contrasting ideologies and values (one kills to protect lives and the other saves lives).</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8">Destiny unites them again after almost a year of separation whey they meet at a war zone &ldquo;Uruk&rdquo;, a land far from Seoul. The new circumstances force them to work closely together.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">The story will tell if their love will blossom in a strange land and an extreme environment. The audience is yet to find out if they will be able fight or succumb to destiny.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10">Some of the sweetest quotes from Descendants of the Sun include:</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph11">&ldquo;I hope you don't think my kiss is bad. I did it after thinking a thousand times.&rdquo;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph12">&ldquo;You are already beautiful.&rdquo; (Yoo Si-jin speaks to Kang Mo-yeon, who is reluctant to make eye contact because she is not wearing any make-up).</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph13">&ldquo;You have so many men to worry about. Just worry about me from now on.&rdquo;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph14">&ldquo;Regarding the kiss, what should I do? Should I apologize for that? Should I confess my feelings to you?&rdquo;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph15">&ldquo;Yes... you know, I have (been bewitched by something).&rdquo; (When Kang Mo-yeon and Yoo Si-jin look at the wrecked ship, Kang asks him: &ldquo;Have you ever been bewitched by something?&rdquo;)</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph16">&ldquo;Because it is far away... I want to spend more time with you.&rdquo; (When Yoo Si-jin and Kang Mo-yeon got to a beach, Kang says to Yoo: &ldquo;Didn't you say the beach is far from here?&rdquo;)</div>
