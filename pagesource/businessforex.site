				<p>Apart from trading in stocks and shares trading in commodities is also a promising area for improving ROR of your investment. You can trade in various commodities of daily consumption such as cereals, grains, spices, oil and much more. Trading in all such consumer products yields the good return and also diversifies your portfolio to a much wider spectrum. This diversification reduces the risk of losses and provides a cushion against any uncertainties. Although almost all the commodity markets yield same returns, investment in oil or trading oil in the commodities segment has proven to be a prosperous option.</p>
<p>As we all know oil is one of the most prominent consumer products of modern days. The demand for oil moving upwards and the supply is also moving almost in the same direction. As the demand and supply of oil and its ancillary products do not seem to get exhausted in the near future it is always recommended to invest in such long-term, prosperous areas which would add diversity to your portfolio and to your profit margins. Trading in oil and other energy products are generally done through intermediaries.</p>
<p>In previous times where there were no online platforms for buying and selling of oil people used to limit their transactions only to a certain area and a specific person. However, the modern day technology has facilitated many online platforms through which oil traders can get in touch with oil online brokers who can help the traders in executing their transactions. Perhaps, technology has made the oil trading through online brokers much easier and flexible.</p>
<p>An oil trader can meet an online broker who is situated in some other country and is willing to involve in a trade. The online oil trading through online brokers is a modern phenomenon under which no physical meeting happens. The traders post their requirements in an online portal which is either developed or maintained by the online broker. Then, he forwards it to the respective parties and if both are on the same grounds the broker will execute the agreement.</p>
<p>If there are any disagreements the broker will try to mend them and then execute the contract. In any of the situations, online brokers play an important role in agreement execution. The payment to an online broker can be made in the mode that is agreed by both the parties.</p>
<p>These specialized brokers would help you not only in trading but also advises you at times of global turmoil.</p>

				<p>Everyone is curious as to what bitcoin is and how one gets to earn it and spend it. Bitcoin is the most famous and biggest digital currency in the world regarding market capitalization and the market share where there are no intermediaries to handle the transactions. Microsoft Co-founder, Bill Gates has a lot of faith in Bitcoin to the point of saying, &#8220;Bitcoin is a technological tour de force.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Leon Louw, a Nobel Peace Prize nominee, every informed person needs to know at least about bitcoin since it has the potential to become one of the world&#8217;s most significant developments.</p>
<p>One can buy bitcoins directly from other bitcoin users via marketplaces or through exchanges, and one pays for them through hard cash, credit or debit cards, electronic wire transfers, other cryptocurrencies, PayPal, et al.</p>
<p>How Then Can One Buy Bitcoins?</p>
<p>Get a Bitcoin Wallet</p>
<p>This is the very first step when buying bitcoins since you will require a place to store, receive, and send your bitcoins. Different bitcoin wallets provide varying levels of security, and you can choose the security level that works best for your transactions. The most popular wallet options are</p>
<p>• A wallet software stored on the hard drive of your computer</p>
<p>• A web-based service that is an online wallet</p>
<p>• A multisig wallet that incorporates the use of many different keys to protect the account and keeps your bitcoins safe and offline</p>
<p>The next step is to fund your Bitcoin wallet and start placing orders.</p>
<p>Where to Buy Bitcoins</p>
<p>• Localbitcoins: &#8211; This is the primary site for arranging face-to-face transactions and prices negotiated. Its escrow service has made the site popular since it adds an added layer of protection for the buyer and the seller with a trust score of A. you can pay for bitcoins via PayPal, cash, or bank transfers.</p>
<p>• Coinbase: &#8211; This is another of the popular bitcoin wallets with one of the simplest ways of buying bitcoin. Upon sign up, one gets a $5 bonus. It has a trust score of A+. Use your card or bank transfers to buy bitcoins.</p>
<p>• Wesellcrypto: &#8211; This site ranks high, and it is beginner friendly. It has a trust rating of B+, and you can buy bitcoins via your PayPal account.</p>
<p>• Bitquick: &#8211; This site is also beginner friendly allowing users to buy and accept payments for bitcoins via hard currency as well as bank transfers. It has a trust rating of B.</p>
<p>With bitcoins, you can anonymously buy merchandise; make cheaper international payments since the Bitcoins are not subject to regulation from any country. The bitcoin market is very volatile and more people are buying them hoping to make a profit when the price goes up.</p>

				<p>Traders are always concerned about &#8216;Bitcoin&#8221;s volatility. It is important to know what makes the value of this particular digital currency highly unstable. Just like many other things, the value of &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; also depends upon the rules of demand and supply. If the demand for &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; increases, then the price will also increase. On the contrary side, the decrease in demand for the &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; will lead to decreased demand. In simple words, we can say that the price is determined by what amount the trading market is agreed to pay. If a large number of people wish to purchase &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217;s, then the price will rise. If more folks want to sell &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217;s, then the price will come down.</p>
<p>It is worth knowing that the value of &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; can be volatile if compared to more established commodities and currencies. This fact can be credited to its comparatively small market size, which means that a lesser amount of money can shift the price of &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; more prominently. This inconsistency will reduce naturally over the passage of time as the currency develops and the market size grows.</p>
<p>After being teased in late 2016, &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; touched a new record high level in the first week of the current year. There could be several factors causing the &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; to be volatile. Some of these are discussed here.</p>
<p><strong>The Bad Press Factor</strong></p>
<p>&#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; users are mostly scared by different news events including the statements by government officials and geopolitical events that &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; can be possibly regulated. It means the rate of &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; adoption is troubled by negative or bad press reports. Different bad news stories created fear in investors and prohibited them from investing in this digital currency. An example of bad headline news is the eminent utilization of &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; in processing drug transactions through Silk Road which came to an end with the FBI stoppage of the market in October 2013. This sort of stories produced panic among people and caused the &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; value to decrease greatly. On the other side, veterans in the trading industry saw such negative incidents as an evidence that the &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; industry is maturing. So the &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; started to gain its increased value soon after the effect of bad press vanished.</p>
<p>Fluctuations of the Perceived Value</p>
<p>Another great reason for &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; value to become volatile is the fluctuation of the &#8216;Bitcoin&#8221;s perceived value. You may know that this digital currency has properties akin to gold. This is ruled by a design decision by the makers of the core technology to restrict its production to a static amount, 21 million BTC. Due to this factor, investors may allocate less or more assets in into &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>News about Security Breaches</strong></p>
<p>Various news agencies and digital media play an important role in building a negative or positive public concept. If you see something being advertised Advantageously, you are likely to go for that without paying much attention to negative sides. There has been news about &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; security breaches and it really made the investors think twice before investing their hard earned money in &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; trading. They become too susceptible about choosing any specific &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; investment platform. &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; may become volatile when &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; community uncovers security susceptibilities in an effort to create a great open source response in form of security fixes. Such security concerns give birth to several open-source software such as Linux. Therefore, it is advisable that &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; developers should expose security vulnerabilities to the general public in order to make strong solutions.</p>
<p>The latest &#8216;OpenSSL&#8217; weaknesses attacked by &#8216;Heartbleed&#8217; bug and reported by Neel Mehta (a member of Google&#8217;s security team) on April 1, 2014, appear to had some descending effect on the value of &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217;. According to some reports, the &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; value decreased up to 10% in the ensuing month as compared to the U.S. Dollar.</p>
<p>Small option value for holders of large &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; Proportions</p>
<p>The volatility of &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; also depends upon &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; holders having large proportions of this digital currency. It is not clear for &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; investors (with current holdings over $10M) that how they would settle a position that expands into a fiat position without moving the market severely. So &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; has not touched the bulk market adoption rates that would be important to give option value to large &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; holders.</p>
<p><strong>Effects of Mt Gox</strong></p>
<p>The recent high-profile damages at &#8216;Mt Gox&#8217; are another great reason for the &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; volatility. All these losses and the resultant news about heavy losses had a dual effect on instability. You may not know that this reduced the general float of &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; by almost 5%. This also created a potential lift on the residual &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; value due to the reason of increased scarcity. Nevertheless, superseding this lift was the negative outcome of the news series that followed. Particularly, many other &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217; gateways saw the large failure at Mt Gox as an optimistic thing for the long-term prospects of the &#8216;Bitcoin&#8217;.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1 &#8211; Understanding Bitcoin And The Block-Chain</strong></p>
<p>Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer payment system, otherwise known as electronic money or virtual currency. It offers a twenty-first century alternative to brick and mortar banking. Exchanges are made via &#8220;e wallet software&#8221;. The bitcoin has actually subverted the traditional banking system, while operating outside of government regulations.</p>
<p>Bitcoin uses state-of-the-art cryptography, can be issued in any fractional denomination, and has a decentralized distribution system, is in high demand globally and offers several distinct advantages over other currencies such as the US dollar. For one, it can never be garnished or frozen by the bank(s) or a government agency.</p>
<p>Back in 2009, when the bitcoin was worth just ten cents per coin, you would have turned a thousand dollars into millions, if you waited just eight years. The number of bitcoins available to be purchased is limited to 21,000,000. At the time that this article was written, the total bitcoins in circulation was 16,275,288, which means that the percentage of total bitcoins &#8220;<em>mined</em>&#8221; was 77.5%. at that time. The current value of one bitcoin, at the time that this article was written, was $1,214.70 USD.</p>
<p>According to Bill Gates, &#8220;Bit coin is exciting and better than currency&#8221;. Bitcoin is a de-centralized form of currency. There is no longer any need to have a &#8220;<em>trusted, third-party</em>&#8221; involved with any transactions. By taking the banks out of the equation, you are also eliminating the lion&#8217;s share of each transaction fee. In addition, the amount of time required to move money from point A to point B, is reduced formidably.</p>
<p>The largest transaction to ever take place using bitcoin is one hundred and fifty million dollars. This transaction took place in seconds with minimal fee&#8217;s. In order to transfer large sums of money using a &#8220;trusted third-party&#8221;, it would take days and cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars. This explains why the banks are violently opposed to people buying, selling, trading, transferring and spending bitcoins.</p>
<p>Only.003% of the worlds (250,000) population is estimated to hold at least one bitcoin. And only 24% of the population know what it is. Bitcoin transactions are entered chronologically in a &#8216;blockchain&#8217; just the way bank transactions are. Blocks, meanwhile, are like individual bank statements. In other words, blockchain is a public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions that have ever been executed. It is constantly growing as &#8216;completed&#8217; blocks are added to it with a new set of recordings. To use conventional banking as an analogy, the blockchain is like a full history of banking transactions.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 &#8211; Setting Up Your E Wallet Software Account</strong></p>
<p>As soon as you create your own unique e wallet software account, you will have the ability to transfer funds from your e wallet to a recipients e wallet, in the form of bitcoin. If you would like to use a bitcoin ATM to withdraw funds from your account, essentially you will link your e wallet &#8216;address&#8217; to the chosen ATM machines e wallet &#8216;address&#8217;. To facilitate the transfer of your funds in bitcoin to and from a trading platform, you will simply link your e wallet &#8216;address&#8217; to the e wallet &#8216;address&#8217; of your chosen trading platform. In actuality, it is much easier than it sounds. The learning curve in relation to using your e wallet, is very short.</p>
<p>To set up an e wallet, there are a myriad of company&#8217;s online that offer safe, secure, free and turn-key e-wallet solutions. A simple Google search will help you find the right e wallet software for you, depending upon what your needs are exactly. Many people get started using a &#8220;blockchain&#8221; account. This is free to set up and very secure. You have the option of setting up a two-tier login protocol, to further enhance the safety and security, in relation to your e wallet account, essentially protecting your account from being hacked into.</p>
<p>There are many options when it comes to setting up your e wallet. A good place to start is with a company called QuadrigaCX. You can find them by doing a Google search. Quadrigacx employs some of the most stringent security protocols that currently exist. Furthermore, Bitcoins that are funded in QuadrigaCX are stored in cold storage, using some of the most secure cryptographic procedures possible. In other words, it is a very safe place for your bitcoin and other digital currencies.</p>
<p>In order to withdraw money in your local currency, from your e wallet, you are required to locate a bitcoin ATM, which can often be found in local businesses within most major cities. Bitcoin ATM&#8217;s can be located by doing a simple Google search.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 &#8211; Purchase Any Fractional Denomination Of Bitcoin</strong></p>
<p>To buy any amount of bitcoin, you are required to deal with a digital currency broker. As with any currency broker, you will have to pay the broker a fee, when you purchase your bitcoin. It is possible to buy.1 of of bitcoin or less if that is all that you would like to purchase. The cost is simply based on the current market value of a full bitcoin at any given time.</p>
<p>There are a myriad of bitcoin brokers online. A simple Google search will allow you to easily source out the best one for you. It is always a good idea to compare their rates prior to proceeding with a purchase. You should also confirm the rate of a bitcoin online, prior to making a purchase through a broker, as the rate does tend to fluctuate frequently.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 &#8211; Stay Away From Any Trading Platfrom Promising Unrealistic Returns To Unsuspecting Investors</strong></p>
<p>Finding a reputable bitcoin trading company that offers a high return is paramount to your online success. Earning 1% per day is considered a high return in this industry. Earning 10% per day is impossible. With online bitcoin trading, it is feasible to double your digital currency within ninety days. You must avoid being lured by any company that is offering returns such as 10% per day. This type of a return is not realistic with digital currency trading. There is a company called Coinexpro that was offering 10% per day to bitcoin traders. And it ended up being a ponzi scheme. If it&#8217;s 10% per day, walk away. The aforementioned trading platform appeared to be very sophisticated and came across as being legitimate. My advice is to focus on trading your bitcoin with a company that offers reasonable returns such as 1% per day. There will be other companies that will attempt to separate you from your bitcoin using unscrupulous methods. Be very cautious when it comes to any company that is offering unrealistic returns. Once you transfer your bitcoin to a recipient, there is literally nothing your can do to get it back. You must ensure that your chosen trading company is fully automated &amp; integrated with <em>blockchain,</em> from receipt to payment. More importantly, it is crucial that you learn to differentiate legitimate trading opportunities from unscrupulous &#8220;company&#8217;s&#8221; that are experts when it comes to separating it&#8217;s clients from their money. The bitcoin and other digital currencies are not the issue. It is the trading platforms that you must exercise caution with, prior to handing over your hard-earned money.</p>
<p>Your ROI should also be upwards of 1%+ per day because the trading company that you are lending your bitcoin to, is most likely earning upwards of 5%+ per day, on average. Your ROI must also be automatically transferred into your &#8220;e-wallet&#8221; at regular intervals, throughout your contract term. There is only one platform that I feel comfortable using. It pay&#8217;s each bitcoin investor/trader 1.1% per day in interest as well as 1.1% per day in capital. This type of a return is staggering compared to what you would earn with traditional financial markets, however, with crypto currency, it is common. Most banks will payout 2% per year!</p>
<p>If you are required to conduct tedious activities such as logging into your account, sending e mails, clicking on links etc, you definitely need to keep searching for a suitable trading company that offers a set-it-and-forget-it type of platform, as they absolutely exist.</p>

<p>Since digital money is used on the Net, no borders are involved. Typically, you have to pay fees should you want to send money abroad, which excludes the costs for currency conversion. On the other hand, sending digital currency to anywhere in the world costs nothing. You will pay nothing as long as you can wait for a while for the currency to be sent.</p>

And the beauty of the system is that it offers 100% acceptance rate. All you have to do is open the digital currency site on your computer or mobile phone and then create the account. You don&#8217;t have to go to the office of a company for account creation. Within a few minutes, the account will be created.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s an Investment</strong></p>
<p>The conventional form of money tends to lose its value with the passage of time because of several factors, such as inflation. However, the digital currency is a form of investment. Most types of currency features a fixed period upon the creation of new coins.</p>
<p>When more and more people go for digital currency, the demand goes up. As a result, the value of your digital money goes up. This is kind of the return on your investment. So, you don&#8217;t have to go to a rich country just to see the value of your money go up. Since the digital currency is growing at a rapid pace, the number of users is increasing. So, it&#8217;s the right time to make the investment and reap the benefits.</p>
<p><strong>The takeaway</strong></p>
<p>So, if you have been looking forward to investing in digital currency, we suggest that you re-read this article again. Hopefully, you will be able to get the most out of your investment down the road.</p>

<p>Technical analysis has been a part of financial practice for many decades. It is a method of prediction price movements and future market trends by using chart. It is necessary for you to know the pros and cons of technical analysis so that you can trade with complete ease.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that technical analysis is the easiest and most precise method of currency trading. So, let&#8217;s find out the top 3 pros and cons so that you can trade with complete ease.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Provides All Current Information</strong></p>
<p>The current price reflects all currently known information about an asset. While rumors may constantly suggest that the price may plummet or surge, ultimately the current price is the balancing point for all information. As investors and traders sway from one side to the other &#8211; buyers or sellers &#8211; the asset moves reflecting the current perception of value.</p>
<p><strong>2. Prices Move in Trends</strong></p>
<p>If prices just gyrate wildly and randomly it would be very hard to make money. While wild gyrations do occur, overall prices typically move in trends. There is a directional bias to the price which provides traders with an advantage. Much of technical analysis is about determining when a trend is in place, when it isn&#8217;t (called a sideways market, range or correction), and when a trend is reversing.</p>
<p>Most profitable trading methods used by traders are trend following strategies. This means you isolate the trend, and then find opportunities to enter in the same direction as the trend, thus capitalizing on the direction biased price movement.</p>
<p>Trends occur on various &#8220;degrees&#8221;. For example, you may have a long term uptrend on the daily or weekly chart, but on shorter time frames &#8211; or at the far left of a chart &#8211; you may have a downtrend.</p>
<p><strong>3. Timing</strong></p>
<p>A major advantage of technical analysis is that it provides you with ways to &#8216;time&#8217; your trades. With a fundamental approach, your research may dig up some interesting news on a company&#8217;s stock that you think may cause it to rise in the future; but when?</p>
<p>With Forex technical analysis you can wait and use you money for other opportunities until the price tells you the stock is ready to move higher.</p>
<p>As there are both merits and demerits of technical analysis, it is also important for you to know the downside. So let&#8217;s check out the cons now.</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> It can be dangerous to depend totally on the assumption that today&#8217;s prices predict future prices. They often do, but not necessarily.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Replying on charts completely will not help you to pick up the signals about the changing of a trend until the change has actually taken place. This means you could miss up to one-third of the fluctuations in currency trading.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> It is also possible in currency trading to act on a pattern prematurely or in a bit of a panic. If a large number of currency traders do this, it can create a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>Go through the points above on the advantages and disadvantages of technical analysis to get more familiar with Forex technical analysis while trading.</p>

				<p><b>Learning about Forex Trading</b></p>
<p>What is Forex Trading? Very simply put, Forex means the Foreign Exchange Marketplace where you can trade currencies. In order to conduct trade and business, currency needs to change hands. Let us take an example. Suppose you are living in India and want to purchase a perfume from France. So it would be considered as an import and either you, or the company that you buy the perfume from is compelled to pay France in Euros. It implies that the Indian importer of the perfume has to exchange the equivalent amount of Rupees into Euros in order for the exchange to take place. Similarly, if you&#8217;re travelling abroad, your local currency is of no use there because it will not be accepted, you need to convert your currency based on the prevalent exchange rates and that is done via Forex. The Forex market is actually the largest marketplace you can ever find in the world. The currency market eclipses the stock exchange market several times over.</p>
<p><strong>What does exchange rate mean?</strong></p>
<p>When you exchange currencies, you pay the price of a single unit of a particular foreign currency in your own currency. The amount of money in your currency which is equal to a single unit of the currency in question is the exchange rate for that currency in your country.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Forex so important?</strong></p>
<p>If we take statistics into account, the daily trading in Forex is estimated to be at a staggering amount of $5 Trillion each day. This fact alone makes it the biggest market with the most liquidity among any financial marketplace, beating stock exchange trading to a sorry second place. Great Britain holds the biggest share of the Forex markets, with about 40% of all trading happening in London. This happened because in 1979 all foreign exchange control methods were cast off in the country. And there was also a very good infrastructure to induce currency trading. The spine of global investment and international trading is built up on Forex. Forex plays a vital part in supporting exports as well as imports to any country, without which, it would have been worse off. These imports/exports in turn will help in accessing resources previously untapped and create greater demand for services as well as goods. If you were the head of a multi-national company, your prospects would be quite limited and hinder growth. This leads to a stagnation or slowdown in the global economy.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of a trade involving Forex</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take it that you are in the USA and want to play with the Euro. If you believe the Euro will rise in the future, then common sense indicates that you will buy Euros in exchange for Dollars based on the current exchange rates. However if you have some Euros in hand and think their value will decrease in future, you&#8217;ll exchange them against the Dollar, thus making a profit. But however you should always keep it in mind that Forex trading is subject to a high risk of loss, the factors of which are beyond your control. Forex trading takes place round the clock and if you&#8217;re financially savvy and buy/sell at the right time, you have a good chance of walking away with a bundle.</p>
<p><strong>Why trade in currency?</strong></p>
<p>Some of the key reasons why Forex is so popular are;</p>
<p>1. Most firms will not charge commissions but only ask for the bid/ask spreads.</p>
<p>2. Convenience of trading on a 24 hour format, especially in today&#8217;s modern times.</p>
<p>3. Leverage trading is also possible; however this can magnify your potential gains or losses.</p>
<p>4. You can narrow down your focus to the &#8220;best&#8221; currencies, instead of getting lost in the stock market with innumerable options that might mislead you.</p>
<p>5. It is accessible to the common man; you really do not have to be a rich man to be a player in the Forex market. A lot of money is not necessary for starting off.</p>
<p><strong>Behind the scenes action</strong></p>
<p>The Forex market works through many financial institutions and is operative on many a level. The banks which are &#8220;invisible&#8221; so to speak go to a lesser number of financial firms which can also be called &#8220;dealers&#8221; as they are referred to in common parlance. These dealers take an active part in exchanging large quantities of foreign currencies based on the exchange rate. As this takes place behind the eyes of the trader, in this question, you, this mode of market is also referred to as &#8220;interbank&#8221; market.</p>
<p><strong>Major players in Forex</strong></p>
<p>1. Banks: The biggest banks in the world all depend on Forex trading for a large part of their business. They also ease Forex transactions for customers and indulge in speculative trading from trading desks.</p>
<p>2. Central Banks: These are major players in Forex markets. The open market operations as well as the policies of interest rate play a big part in influencing currency rates. I say this because any actions taken by the central bank will act in the interests of the nation by increasing or stabilizing the economy.</p>
<p>3. Investors/Hedge funds: You&#8217;ll find a lot of investors trading currencies in order to bulk up endowments and pension funds. Also, hedge funds may indulge in speculative trades at times.</p>
<p>4. Corporations: Those firms engaged in import and export will have to rely on Forex to ease and facilitate transfer of goods as well as services.</p>
<p>5. Individuals: The Forex market gains popularity by the day among the gentry, who after consultation or research, decide to try their hand at Forex.</p>
<p><strong>Forex opportunities for you</strong></p>
<p>If you have not tried your hand at Forex yet, you can jolly well give it a try. All you need is a sound geo-political knowledge, coupled with some latest feeds on the exchange rates. This is because the exchange rates are dependent on many factors like rate of interest, flow of trade, the volume of tourism, economy of the country, and a lot of other factors. So you have to think carefully before starting off.</p>

				<p>Have you been looking for Forex trading tips for success? If so, you may find this article helpful. While the tips can&#8217;t guarantee success, they can definitely help you get a lot of important things done. Moreover, they can save you a good deal of money. According to experienced Forex traders, many people lose a lot of money just because they have no idea of the basic principles. Given below are 5 tips for beginners of this field. Read on.</p>
<p><strong>Money Management</strong></p>
<p>First of all, you have to learn how to survive. In other words, you need to learn as to how to stay in the game. Next, you need to look for a profitable strategy. Actually, what you need to do is use a powerful money management trading attitude.</p>
<p>If you want to be on the safe side, you should not risk greater than 3% of the capital for each trade. When you are just starting out, make sure your trading capital is enough for a minimum of 40 trades.</p>
<p><strong>Use a stop loss</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps, the stop loss is your most powerful tool as a Forex trader. With this tool, you can get a pretty good idea of your risk. So, we suggest that you use it at all times. As a matter of fact, it spurs on you to consider the trade that you are going to start would be taken as a failure.</p>
<p><strong>Be realistic</strong></p>
<p>If you are lucky, you can&#8217;t close more than 8 out of 10 of your trades with a good deal of profit. Actually, what you need to do is set reasonable expectations. Setting unreasonable expectations will only cause disappointments, failures and frustrations.</p>
<p>You should consider things realistically when you are just starting out. You should determine the amount of time you can invest for learning and trading. Once you have a good idea of your tools and other stuff, you will find it easier to get a lucrative trading strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Get in Touch with other traders</strong></p>
<p>For starters, one of the most underestimated sources of information and inspiration is other traders. There is no doubt that reading books and guides about the subject is important. As a matter of fact, books can help you lay a strong foundation.</p>
<p>Another great tool to help you get the hang of the business is practicing. So, we suggest that you become part of a good Forex community both online and in your locality. You don&#8217;t have to be embarrassed just because you are just starting out.</p>
<p><strong>Control your emotions</strong></p>
<p>While this one is going to be discussed in the end, we can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s not important. As said earlier, Forex trading is fun, exciting and dynamic. However, you don&#8217;t have to get carried away just because you suffered some loss in the beginning. You should go about it like a business and not like a hobby.</p>
<p>So, if you have been looking for some good tips to succeed as a trader, we suggest that you use the tips given in this article.</p>

				<p>A stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator comparing the closing price of a security to its price range over a specific period of time. It is one of the earliest technical oscillators in securities trading used to predict future market direction.</p>
<p>&#8216;Stochastic&#8217; is the Greek word for &#8216;random&#8217;, and in the context of trading refers to using past actions to forecast a future state. The word &#8216;Oscillator&#8217; refers to repetitive variations up or down the equilibrium position.</p>
<p>Below are 3 simple steps to make the most out of a stochastic oscillator you can use when trading the slow stochastic.</p>
<p>The strategies increase in complexity as we progress through each of the examples.</p>
<p>Therefore, it would be wise to approach each strategy with an open mind as they will challenge the conventional thinking of how to use the slow stochastic indicator when trading Forex.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 &#8211; Identify a stochastic oscillator with smooth slopes</strong></p>
<p>Stochastics that have smooth slopes, which move from overbought to over sell, imply that the move down was sharp and without much reaction. This, in turn, strengthens the odds of a counter move up.</p>
<p>While this is potentially the simplest of slow stochastic strategies, it still has its flaws.</p>
<p>For starters, sharp moves up or down can start consolidation patterns prior to continuing the trend. If you were to simply place buy and sell signals because of the smooth slow stochastic slope, you are headed down a rough road.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 &#8211; The Pop Method</strong></p>
<p>Another trading trick is the POP Method. The basis of this system is to enter long trades when the index goes above 70 and sell trades when it goes below 30.</p>
<p>Trades are closed when the stochastic crosses the overbought (for buy trades) or the oversold (for sell trades). This method performed well at the 70&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s and works even today on Forex pairs that trend strongly, such as the GBP/JPY.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 &#8211; Combine the slow stochastics with trendlines</strong></p>
<p>As we just mentioned earlier in this article, the slow stochastics can provide a number of false signals. The best way I have determined to overcome this flaw is to combine the slow stochastics with trendlines in order to identify proper entry and exit points.</p>
<p>So, if you are looking to benefit from stochastic oscillators in your own Forex trading, I recommend that you try out the 3 steps above and see how your trading could improve.</p>
