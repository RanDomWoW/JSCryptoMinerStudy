Be sure to pin it using the share bar at the top![\/caption]\r\n\r\nI get it all the time:\r\n\r\n\"Hi! Where are you from?\"\r\n\r\n\"The UK\"\r\n\r\n\"Cool, where about?\"\r\n\r\n\"You probably haven't of heard of it, it's called Bury St Edmunds\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Near Cambridge\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"OK, you know London?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yeah, is it close to London?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not really, but . . . \"\r\n\r\nI'm sure you get the idea and if you come from a smaller place yourself, you've probably encountered this too. Well, that made me realise something, I spend so much time writing about other places, why not share some hometown pride and introduce the place I call home. Although I don\u2019t live there anymore, I loved growing up there and thought it was only fair to the town that gave me so much to try and get it on your bucket list and tell you all about the things to do in Bury St Edmunds.\r\n<h1>1. Greene King Brewery<\/h1>\r\nBased in Westgate Street, Bury St Edmunds, Greene King is one of the biggest real ale brewers in the UK (maybe even the biggest). They have been brewing in the town since they were established in 1799 and have gone on to own pubs across the country. But this is what you need to know - the brewery operates tours throughout the day, and having been three times, I highly recommend them. You will get to visit the brew house, learn about brewing cask ales, walk out on \u00a0the roof of the brewery for some spectacular views and of course, taste plenty of the product. If you don\u2019t have time for the full tour, you could always pop into the Greene King Beer Cafe where you can sample much of the range and get a bite to eat. Find out more about tours here:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.greenekingshop.co.uk\/brewery-tours\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Greene King Brewery tours<\/a>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2353\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"wp-image-2353 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Brewery-Tour-at-The-Greene-King-Brewery.jpg\" alt=\"Visit Greene King and do a brewery tour\" width=\"600\" height=\"396\" \/> Greene King Beer Cafe[\/caption]\r\n<h2>2. The Theatre Royal<\/h2>\r\nThis wonderful National Trust theatre is said to be the only remaining working Regency playhouse in the country. Originally built in 1819, it has recently undergone extensive renovations to take it back closer to its original Georgian look and it hasn\u2019t lost its charm in the process. Expect to be close to the acts in this intimate performance space that hosts a varied programme of shows and events throughout the year. Take a look at what\u2019s on\u00a0at the Theatre Royal here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatreroyal.org\/upcoming\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shows upcoming at the Theatre Royal<\/a>\r\n<h2>3. St Edmundsbury Cathedral, also known as The Cathedral Church of St James<\/h2>\r\nSo let\u2019s start with a bit of history. Originally the church was known as St Denis\u2019s Church, but in the 12th century, when Anselm was the Abbot of St Edmundsbury, he decided he wanted to make a pilgrimage along the St James\u2019s way, more commonly known around the world as Santiago de Compostela to the shrine of Saint James the Great in Galicia. However, he was persuaded by his peers that it wasn\u2019t a good idea and didn\u2019t do it. But I guess he still felt he had a burning desire to do something a little Saint Jamesey, so he decided to rebuild the old church and rename it \u00a0St James\u2019s Church. I think a walk would have been the easier option and I also feel a little bad for Denis - \u00a0losing his church after James already has so much glory is a shame, but that\u2019s the way it all went down.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2356\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2356\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/St-Edmundsbury-Cathedral.jpg\" alt=\"The Main aisle at the St Edmundsbury Cathedral\" width=\"600\" height=\"486\" \/> The Main aisle at the St Edmundsbury Cathedral[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe church became a cathedral in 1914 and has since kept growing. The roof and the font are stand out features, and there is also a small display room with some local treasures. Interestingly, although you wouldn\u2019t know by looking at it, the St Edmundsbury cathedral tower wasn\u2019t completed until 2005 after funding was granted by the Millennium Commission.\r\n<h2>4. St Mary\u2019s Church<\/h2>\r\nWhile the cathedral is bright and almost feels modern, just up the road is St Mary\u2019s Church which feels like stepping back in time and is a wonderful contrast. The church is one of the largest parish churches in England, it claims to have the second longest aisle, and the largest West Window of any parish church in the country. I think that makes it worth a visit.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2358\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2358\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/St-Marys-Church-Graveyard.jpg\" alt=\"The Graveyard by St Mary's Church in Bury St Edmunds\" width=\"600\" height=\"416\" \/> St Mary's Church Graveyard[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWhat . . . you want more? OK, how about if I also tell you there is royalty buried there? Will that do it for you? St Mary\u2019s Church is the final burial place of Mary Tudor, sister of King Henry VIII. After the death of her first husband, the king of France, (30 years older than her, she allegedly danced him to death three months after their wedding) Mary was immediately promised by her brother Henry to the Duke of Savoy. Mr Eighth sent an ambassador to pick her up from France but on the way she managed to persuade the ambassador to marry her instead. He must have been a brave man as not many went against the famously fragile tempered King, but he seemed to get away with it (after paying a whopping fine to the cash-strapped King) and they lived in Suffolk until she died and was buried in the Abbey before being moved to the church.\r\n\r\nThe tomb itself is quite small and easy to miss (it took me about 10 minutes and I knew where it was!) so look carefully. In the words of the church\u2019s information sign: \u201cIt really is a modest tomb for someone who was the daughter of a King, sister of a King, wife of a King and grandmother of a Queen\u201d.\r\n\r\nPoignantly, the colours of the Suffolk Regiment also hang in the church, recording battle honours over the centuries.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2359\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2359\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/St-Marys-Church.jpg\" alt=\"Discover a royal tomb in St Mary's Church\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/> Mary Tudor's tomb and the stained glass windows[\/caption]\r\n<h2>5. The Great Courtyard and West Front<\/h2>\r\nAs you stand next to the statue of St Edmund, in the middle of the courtyard, you will be surrounded by interesting architecture, most of which stems from The Abbey of Bury St Edmunds (more on that in a bit).\r\n\r\nThe courtyard is built up on three sides, the Cathedral to the North, Norman Tower to the west and confusingly the West Front to the East. I have already written about the cathedral above, so if you skipped it, you can go back now. The Norman Tower used to be the main gateway to the abbey and is still used to this day as the bell tower for the cathedral.\r\n\r\nThe West Front is a small part of the original abbey still standing, it was the main entrance to what must have been a spectacular complex. To the south the courtyard joins the St Mary\u2019s Church graveyard with tombstones dating back hundreds of years.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2360\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Statue-of-St-Edmunds.jpg\" alt=\"The statue of St Edmund in Bury\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/> Statue of St Edmund with the West Front (left) and Cathedral tower behind[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOther interesting sights in the courtyard are the Norman Tower House, a stunning house next to the tower. Built in 1846, if you fancy owning it yourself, it was recently on the market with a guide price of \u2018only\u2019 \u00a31,500,000. There is also the Martyr\u2019s Memorial, a monument to the 17 Protestants who were burnt in the town at the command of Queen Mary the 1st, aka Bloody Mary. Not to be confused with Mary Tudor, who\u2019s buried in the nearby St Mary\u2019s church (as you already know unless you skipped that bit too!).\r\n<h2>6. Abbey Gardens<\/h2>\r\nThe main entrance to the Abbey Gardens is through The Abbey Gate, on Angel Hill. For those of you whose history only goes back a meagre few centuries I would point out that the current Abbey Gate is the new version . . . \u00a0built in the 1300s (rioting townspeople tore down the original one in 1327). The Abbey Gardens contain the ruins of The Abbey of Bury St Edmunds as well as wonderful landscape, flowers and entertainments. It is free to get into and is a great area to unleash the kids with a large playground and aviary.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2350\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2350\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Abbey-Ruins-and-Gardens.jpg\" alt=\"The Abbey Gardens in Bury St Edmunds\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/> The Abbey Ruins and the Gardens overlooked by the Cathedral[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Abbey of Bury St Edmunds was once one of the richest of the Benedictine monasteries in the country and (probably) the burial site of St Edmund the Martyr King, viciously killed by those pesky Vikings. Sadly, after King Henry VIII decided to go a bit anti-monks and create his own version of religion (more to do with replacing a boring old wife with a tantalising new model than any real conviction), the abbey, like many other in the UK thanks to the Dissolution of the monasteries in 1539, was torn down. Much of the building material was pilfered and reused about the town ( you can spot lumps of abbey stone in the walls in many town centre homes) and the ruins are all that remain. The abbey was also the site where a group of Barons came together to discuss forcing King John to sign the Magna Carta aimed at limiting the King's power and establishing a fair law across the country (and which went on to be the basis of other countries\u2019 constitutions, such as the USA and India). Ironic really, that it was a king who ordered the Abbey\u2019s destruction just 100 years later.\r\n<h2>7. Pillar of Salt<\/h2>\r\nDating to the 1930s, it is easy to pass this handsome, tall and white column without even realising what it is. Located on Angel Hill, close to the Abbey Gate, this sign is thought to be the first illuminated roadsign in the country. It is also on the country\u2019s list of nationally important sites, being described as \"individual and probably unique\".\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2349\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2349\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Abbey-Gate.jpg\" alt=\"Abbey Gate on Angel Hill\" width=\"600\" height=\"528\" \/> The Abbey Gate with the Pillar or Salt to the left[\/caption]\r\n<h2>8. A cocktail in the cellars of The Angel Hotel<\/h2>\r\nAs an ex-employee it\u2019s probably a bit cheeky including this, but I have some great memories from working there and for centuries the Angel Hotel has been at the heart of Bury St Edmunds. They have entertained many famous guests through the years here including Angelina Jolie, Pierce Brosnan and even Charles Dickens was a guest there once (he was suitably impressed and decided to include its name in his novel The Pickwick Papers). Since Mr Dickens\u2019 visit, The Angel has undergone many changes and its modern interior belies its old school frontage. In fact, much of it is a little like wandering around a modern art gallery (I\u2019ll leave it for you to decide if you like the art or not). My favourite place \u00a0in The Angel is downstairs in The Wingspan Bar, formerly known as The Vaults.\r\n\r\nLocated in (allegedly) secret undergound tunnels that date back to the 12th century, the comfortable and curious surrounds are a great place to relax with friends and enjoy a cocktail, or two . . . or four?\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2351\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2351\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Angel-Hill.jpg\" alt=\"Angel Hotel on Angel Hill\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/> Angel Hotel on Angel Hill, looks stunning in the summer as it gets overtaken by the ivy[\/caption]\r\n<h2>9. Shop fronts<\/h2>\r\nIt\u2019s easy to understand why you\u2019d be walking around with your eyes looking where you are going, but don\u2019t. . . \u00a0lift your head and look up. In contrast to the modern shop fronts, many of the buildings have wonderful facades above street level, be sure to take a closer look as you wander around the town. An added bonus is that if you walk around looking up, people tend to get out of your way (and you can keep an eye on the pigeon that had a dodgy meal and is looking to get rid of it).\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2355\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2355\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Shop-Fronts.jpg\" alt=\"Bury St Edmunds shop fronts\" width=\"600\" height=\"348\" \/> Don't forget to look up![\/caption]\r\n<h2>10. The Nutshell<\/h2>\r\nThis quirky little pub is the smallest pub in the UK. Well, many have tried to claim to be smaller, but most of them have beer gardens, which in my view, is cheating. Expect to be cramped and uncomfortable, but the beer is always good and the walls are like a mini museum, covered in pieces of stuff that locals have donated from their travels. Oh, touching the mummified cat that hangs above the bar is considered bad luck, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Unless touching ancient dead cats is your thing, in which case, go ahead and give it a stroke.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2362\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2362\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/The-Nutshell.jpg\" alt=\"The Nutshell\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/> The smallest pub in the UK?[\/caption]\r\n<h2>11. Market<\/h2>\r\nThe thriving Bury St Edmunds market is every Wednesday and Saturday, and takes over the town centre, creating a lively atmosphere as the streets fill with people traders try to out shout each other about how cheap their bananas are. It is home to stalls selling everything from locally grown fruit and veg, fresh fish, flowers, clothing, world foods and of course those stalls that all markets have that just seem to sell a whole variety of random crap.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2354\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2354\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Bury-St-Edmunds-Market.jpg\" alt=\"Bury St Edmunds Market\" width=\"600\" height=\"383\" \/> The Market takes place every Wednesday and Saturday[\/caption]\r\n<h2>12. Independent shops<\/h2>\r\nIf you love discovering hidden gems and smaller shops where you never quite know what you\u2019re going to find, St John\u2019s Street is perfect. The gently sloped shopping street leads downhill from the town with many small, independent retailers that cover a huge range of goodies from handmade jewellery, gourmet food, clothing and even a shop called Secrets, but shhh, the town doesn\u2019t like to talk about that sexy little corner. If you visit the town by train this is the street which will give you a delightful introduction to Bury St Edmunds.\r\n<h2>13. The Abbeygate Cinema<\/h2>\r\nOf course there is the Cineworld in Bury St Edmunds, but if you're a movie lover staying for a couple of days then I\u2019d definitely recommend seeing a movie at the Abbeygate. The cinema shows a wonderful mix of movies, from arthouse pictures to major blockbusters. However, what makes it really stand out is the screening rooms come complete with sofas and are licensed. That means you can grab that glass of wine at the bar, take it into the movie and snuggle with a loved one on a couch while enjoying the movie (unfortunately they do not supply blankets). Oh, and one other thing, it also has a great restaurant serving possibly the best burgers in town. See what films are on at The Abbeygate Cinema:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.abbeygatecinema.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What's on at The Abbeygate<\/a>\r\n<h2>14. Moyse\u2019s Hall<\/h2>\r\nThe exact origins of this building are rather sketchy, it may have been a tavern, it may have been the place that a lady\u2019s foot burst into flames and fell rotting from her body, thanks to The Devil. It was definitely a prison of sorts, but it is now a museum. True to its eclectic roots, the collections inside range from clocks and militaria to items of torture (my personal favourites as a fascinated child) and lots about the infamous local Red Barn Murder that had much of country gossiping in the 1800s. I recommend this article for more information if that bit about rotting flesh piqued your attention and the video below is pretty good too. -\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.stedmundsburychronicle.co.uk\/msebuild.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The History of Moyse's Hall<\/a>\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=w28gZqnDTVM&feature=youtu.be\r\n<h2>15. Arc Shopping Centre<\/h2>\r\nAs well as having wonderful independent stores, if shopping is your thing, the arc shopping centre has all the high street covered. A modern development, it is worth checking out if just for the futuristic architecture of Debenhams, which looks a bit like it\u2019s ready to take off and fly away at any moment. I\u2019m also going to throw in that if you need to spend a penny (not in the shopping way) then the arc is home to award winning public toilets, super clean, spacious and free!\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2352\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2352\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/arc-shopping-centre.jpg\" alt=\"arc shopping centre Bury St Edmunds\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" \/> The futuristic looking Debenhams at arc shopping centre[\/caption]\r\n<h2>16. The Apex<\/h2>\r\nLocated within the arc shopping centre, The Apex is a modern concert hall and event space which, while not big on capacity, is big on acoustics. Many of the acts that play there have actually commented that it has the best acoustics in the UK, maybe even Europe. Find out more about that and what\u2019s on and coming up at The Apex on their website: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theapex.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Apex<\/a>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2361\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2361\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/The-Apex.jpg\" alt=\"The Apex Bury St Edmunds\" width=\"600\" height=\"382\" \/> The Apex has a cafe during the day, great for people watching[\/caption]\r\n<h2>17. The Bury Christmas Market<\/h2>\r\nThere\u2019s nothing like sipping a mulled wine to stave off the winter chill while strolling through market stalls in the build up to Christmas. Well, once a year the town gets taken over by Christmas festivities for locals and visitors to sip mulled wine until their hearts\u2019 content. The Bury Christmas Market is regularly touted as one of the best in the UK, stretching from the top of the town all the way down, and into the Abbey Gardens with loads of market stalls, street food vendors, live stage performances and more. The event usually takes place towards the end of November, and if you plan on staying locally, you\u2019d better book your accommodation early.\r\n\r\nBonus tip: The town also holds quite a few other markets and fayres throughout the year, including the Whitsun Fayre and a massive food event, normally in August.

Guided Walk by a Blue Badge Guide<\/h2>\r\nSo you don\u2019t want to go to the effort of discovering it all for yourself? Smart. Luckily, Bury St Edmunds Blue Badge Tour Guides have got your back. There are many benefits to doing a guided tour, they\u2019ll take you to unknown little spots and tell stories and tales of the town throughout the history. I\u2019ll hold my hand up and admit I haven\u2019t done one myself, but I have often walked past and earwigged in, and they know their stuff!

Eat \u00a0&amp; Drink<\/h2>\r\nOne thing you won\u2019t be when visiting the town is hungry or thirsty. With loads of coffee shops, pubs and restaurants you\u2019ll be spoilt for choice. Personally, I like to support independents, so while you can find pretty much all chains in the town, here are a few lesser-known stars in the town:\r\n<h3>Independent Restaurants, Pubs and Bars in Bury St Edmunds<\/h3>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/nineteen-twentyone.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1921<\/a><\/strong> - Recently a winner of Suffolk Magazine\u2019s Best Restaurant award, 1921 follows an unconventional approach with relaxed service and the stunning food reigning supreme.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/peaporridge.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pea Porridge<\/a><\/strong> - With a cosy, homely, laid back ambience the hands-on owners, Justin Sharp (head chef-proprietor) and his wife Jurga (front-of-house), like to keep things lively, fresh and exciting.

That does tours? With tasting?\r\n<h2>Getting to Bury St Edmunds<\/h2>\r\nThe town is located just off the A14 between Cambridge and Ipswich and takes about one hour and fifteen minutes to get to Bury St Edmunds from London by car. Other options include National Express buses, the the Bury bus station located in the middle of town, and train.\r\n\r\nThe railway station is a little further out, located about 1km north of the town centre. Sadly there aren\u2019t many direct trains to Bury St Edmunds, most of the time you will have to change at Ipswich, Stowmarket or Cambridge train station, you can check train times here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thetrainline.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Trainline<\/a>\r\n<h2>Places to stay in Bury St Edmunds<\/h2>\r\nOne thing that Bury struggles with is decent, affordable accommodation. Even with the recent opening of a Premier Inn, it has done little to bring down the average room rates. That said, depending on when you visit, deals can be found. Here is a list of a few places to stay in Bury St Edmunds that I would happily recommend. Note - The links will take you to the booking.com page to check availability. If you book via the link here I make a small commission to help keep the site going but don't worry, it doesn't affect the price.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.booking.com\/hotel\/gb\/the-old-cannon-brewery.html?aid=1286843&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Old Cannon Brewery<\/a>\u00a0- An independent B&amp;B with pub and micro brewery.

It was while visiting myself that I discovered a small project that aims to improve lives through education. Welcome to Jimmy's School.\r\n<h2><strong>The Kids of the Angkor Wat Temples<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nAfter a day of temple trotting in Angkor Wat, as much as I enjoyed it, I was surprised at just how many kids there were trying to sell things to me. Whether small trinkets and souvenirs or food and drink, there was a child that had what you wanted. What was also shocking is just how good they are at it.\r\n\r\nHowever, I couldn\u2019t help but wish they were in school instead. Cambodia has a free school system; however, as in many areas of the world where poverty is common the issue comes when families have to buy school uniforms and textbooks; many simply can\u2019t afford to send their kids to school.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1356\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1356\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/local-933972_640-min.jpg\" alt=\"Buying souvenirs at the Angkor Wat temples\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" \/> Kids of all ages are trying to make money for their parents.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1352 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/20131222_1631-min.jpg\" alt=\"20131222_1631-min\" width=\"504\" height=\"336\" \/>\r\n\r\nAs I was returning to my hotel I passed a place called Jimmy\u2019s School and decided to investigate. I popped in and met Jimmy, tuk-tuk driver by day and educator in the evening.\r\n<h2><strong>Free English lessons in Cambodia at Jimmy's School<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1714\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"200\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1714\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Discovering-1-200x300.png\" alt=\"Discovering Jimmy's School, Siem Reap, Cambodia\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" \/> Please help spread the word and pin this![\/caption]\r\n\r\nJimmy explained to me that he founded the school with the income from his tuk-tuk business with the aim of providing free English lessons to local children in Siem Reap.\r\n\r\nHe went on to explain that many kids are forced to sell things to tourists or beg throughout the day as it is the only way that the family receives an income and are able to feed themselves. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/milk-scam-siem-reap\/\">(Read about the Milk Baby begging scam here)<\/a>.\r\n\r\nHis goal is to educate them in the evenings for free; he hopes that some of his kids can make it to college one day and equip themselves for better jobs but even if the lessons just make them happier and better able to communicate with tourists, Jimmy will be achieving great things.\r\n<h2><strong>Helping to teach in Cambodia<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nI asked if I could attend a class later that evening and Jimmy explained that there was actually no lesson as it was a public holiday, but the kids would still be coming for food, drink and dancing and I was welcome to join them. I accepted his kind offer and headed back to the hotel to find out more about Jimmy\u2019s School.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1354\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"504\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1354 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/20131222_1647-min.jpg\" alt=\"Swinging through Angkor Wat\" width=\"504\" height=\"335\" \/> I caught these kids having a break from selling and loving swinging around on the vines that hang from the trees.[\/caption]\r\n<h2><strong>My Experience at Jimmy's School<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nLater that evening I headed back to school just as the kids were arriving. Smiling and full of life they sat down and paid attention as Jimmy spoke to them. He started talking to the class about the importance of education and how they are the future of Cambodia.\r\n\r\nThe class listened as he continued to tell them that they are so young and can achieve anything they want to if they study hard and help each other. It was an inspiring talk, I was almost welling up. To think Jimmy has made this school from scratch having started off as a tuk-tuk driver wanting to make a difference in his town is so inspiring, the world needs more Jimmys.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1348\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"504\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1348 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/20131222_1521-min.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting Jimmy's School in Siem Reap\" width=\"504\" height=\"358\" \/> The smiling kids just let you know what a great job Jimmy is doing[\/caption]\r\n<h2><strong>My turn to speak to the kids<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nWhen he was done with his talk he invited me to take the mic and talk to the class. I\u2019ll admit, I wasn\u2019t expecting this and I have never done public speaking before so I was a little nervous.\r\n\r\nWatched over by a smiling Jimmy, I introduced myself and talked a little about schools in England and then invited questions. The kids were great as they asked me about my travels, a project I worked on in Africa and what education is like there.\r\n\r\nAll in all, we were probably chatting together for a good 20-25 minutes. After I had finished the food came out. I helped to serve the kids before being invited to also have a meal myself and join them, an unexpected bonus.\r\n\r\nOnce everyone was fed it was time for dancing, the music kicked in and the kids went nuts as a few favourites were played. The little ones were going crazy to Gangnam Style and The Macarena . . . well . . . the big ones were too; I\u2019m not going to lie.\r\n\r\nThe 2 hours I spent with Jimmy in his school flew by and before I knew it I was saying goodbye to the kids as there were smiles everywhere.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1349 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/20131222_1523.jpg\" alt=\"Jimmy's School\" width=\"504\" height=\"338\" \/>\r\n<h2><strong>Please try to help<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nJimmy is still a tuk-tuk driver by day and currently spends about 60% of his earnings on running the school. If you would like to know more, please send me an email and I can put you in touch with Jimmy - hello@thetravelblogs.com.\r\n<h2><strong>The best tuk-tuk tours of Angkor<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nAnother great way to help is that if you are planning to visit the Angkor site,\u00a0 book Jimmy to take you on his tuk-tuk.\u00a0He operates tours and chat to him about what suits you and your time frames. In my opinion, with a good guide, <a href=\"http:\/\/twotalltravellers.com\/angkor-wat-day\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one day\u00a0 in Angkor Wat<\/a> is enough to get a good flavour and see the main temples.\r\n\r\nSadly I only found out about this on my return, although my trip was great, I\u2019d imagine a trip to Angkor with Jimmy would be another level of awesome. He has been able to set up his own website which can be found here:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.jimmysangkortours.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http:\/\/www.jimmysangkortours.com<\/a>\r\n\r\nFind out what other people say about him on Trip Advisor: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tripadvisor.co.uk\/Attraction_Review-g297390-d9553112-Reviews-Jimmy_s_Angkor_Tours-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jimmy's Angkor Tours on Trip Advisor<\/a>\r\n\r\nIt was an honour to come across such a great project and spend a little time with someone as passionate as Jimmy, something that will stay with me forever.\r\n<h2><strong>Are you a Travel Blogger?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nIf you want your blog to be added to our map be sure to check out our submit your blog page here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/submit-your-blog\">http:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/submit-your-blog<\/a>\r\n<h2><strong>More from The Travel Blogs<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n[pt_view id=\"250c6f8kli\"]","post_title":"Discovering Jimmy's School in Siem Reap","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"discovering-jimmys-school-siem-reap","to_ping":"","pinged":"\nhttps:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/milk-scam-siem-reap\/","post_modified":"2017-11-21 08:37:11","post_modified_gmt":"2017-11-21 08:37:11","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/?p=1346","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"40","filter":"raw","animate_tooltips":true,"animate_pinpoints":true,"google_coords":["13.353753828571","103.85142236300999","10"],"pin_image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/The-Travel-Blogs-Original-Content.png","size":{"0":30,"1":40,"2":3,"3":"width=\"30\" height=\"40\"","bits":8,"mime":"image\/png"},"anchor":[15,40]},"pin_city":"Siem Reap","pin_zip":"","data_tags":{"27":27},"popup_enabled":false,"tooltip_enabled":true,"tooltip_close":"auto","tooltip_content":"<p><strong>Discovering Jimmy's School in Siem Reap<\/strong><\/p>\n"},{"ID":2990,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2017-08-19 13:51:02","post_date_gmt":"2017-08-19 13:51:02","post_content":"Discover travel blogs from all over the Middle East and Asia","post_title":"Middle East","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"middle-east","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2017-10-17 08:25:20","post_modified_gmt":"2017-10-17 08:25:20","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/?post_type=map-location&#038;p=2990","menu_order":0,"post_type":"map-location","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","animate_tooltips":true,"animate_pinpoints":true,"google_coords":["20.892827455417","45.612884750000035","10"],"pin_image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Content-e1493362578649.png","size":{"0":39,"1":65,"2":3,"3":"width=\"39\" height=\"65\"","bits":8,"mime":"image\/png"},"anchor":[20,65]},"pin_city":"","pin_zip":"","data_tags":[],"popup_enabled":false,"tooltip_enabled":true,"tooltip_close":"auto","tooltip_content":"<p><strong>Middle East<\/strong><br \/>Blogs from The Middle East and Asia<\/p>\n"},{"ID":1659,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2017-01-31 10:33:59","post_date_gmt":"2017-01-31 10:33:59","post_content":"<h2>Sunsets, Rice Fields and a Hostage in the Monkey Forest<\/h2>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1710\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"200\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1710\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/UBUD-1-200x300.png\" alt=\"The hostage crisis in Ubud Monkey Forest\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" \/> Love it?

As\u00a0long\u00a0as you\u00a0visit\u00a0understanding\u00a0that are many\u00a0markets\u00a0with pushy sellers, men\u00a0on\u00a0corners\u00a0making\u00a0a strange clicky noise and\u00a0shouting\u00a0\u201cTaxi\u201d and\u00a0accept\u00a0for what it is,\u00a0then\u00a0you\u2019ll have a\u00a0blast.

However, you\u00a0don\u2019t have to\u00a0go\u00a0far\u00a0to\u00a0get\u00a0out of the\u00a0way\u00a0to\u00a0find\u00a0a\u00a0little\u00a0piece\u00a0of\u00a0calm\u00a0and\u00a0tranquillity as I found out on day 2.\r\n<h2>Finding hotels in Ubud<\/h2>\r\nMy first day was spent looking for a place to stay, and this was my stand out memory number one. I spent about half a day nosing around various places to stay and enjoyed every minute of it. Most accommodation is hidden behind imposing stone gateways that face onto the narrow streets. You can often walk by without even realising. When you do pass through you\u2019ll find amazing places to stay hidden away in lush tropical gardens. As well as being a great way to find the best value place to stay, it is also a great way to see the town and a cheap way to spend the day exploring the wonderful tropics talking to locals about what to do.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1670\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1670\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/DSC_2111.jpg\" alt=\"Finding cheap accommodation in Ubud\" width=\"640\" height=\"419\" \/> The gardens and pool where I ended up staying[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1669\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1669\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/DSC_2083.jpg\" alt=\"Markets in Ubud, Bali\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" \/> Ubud markets[\/caption]\r\n<h2>Sunsets and Rice Fields<\/h2>\r\nDay two was spent enjoying the markets followed by a massage and making every effort to avoid people clicking at me and offering\u00a0taxis. In until the evening\u00a0I went for a\u00a0sunset walk around the rice fields.\r\n\r\nJust to the north of the main part of the tourist area are wonderful little footpaths that wind their way through the paddy fields. This is my second stand-out memory of Ubud, as I walked and when the orange sun dipped below the palm trees, the light reflected off the flooded fields and filled the air with colour, it was like a moment of magic had struck.\r\n\r\nThen I got bitten by a mosquito which snapped me back to reality, but after re-applying my DEET, I could refocus on capturing pictures and simply enjoying the moment.\u00a0 Note the subtle advice there, take mosquito repellent or go with someone that tastes sweeter than you do.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1672\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1672\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/DSC_2137.jpg\" alt=\"Ubud rice fields in Bali\" width=\"640\" height=\"441\" \/> Flooded rice field of Ubud[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1671\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1671\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/DSC_2127.jpg\" alt=\"Sunset over the Ubud rice fields\" width=\"640\" height=\"434\" \/> Sunset starts to fill the sky with orange.[\/caption]\r\n<h2>Visiting the Ubud Monkey Forest<\/h2>\r\nFinally, day three and my overall highlight. If you have read any much of my stuff or seen many of my photos, I am sure you have realised that I can never miss the chance to interact with my primitive brothers.\r\n\r\nYou can imagine my excitement to visit a place named the Monkey Forest. Now depending whose blog you read you will find mixed reviews about this place. Some people (like me) love it; whereas others recommend avoiding it and you\u2019ll read why in a bit.\r\n\r\nFrom the main tourist area it is probably about a 20-minute walk south, conveniently located at the end of Monkey Forest Road. If you get tired there are plenty of bars and restaurants you can stop for a drink along the way which all have amazing views across the paddy fields behind. The Laughing Buddha is one that was recommended to me although I didn\u2019t get to check it out as it was closed when I passed.\r\n\r\nI visited with a travel friend I met along the way, for the sake of this blog, let\u2019s call him Ronald. We went in the morning; I think the best time to visit the Monkey Forest is either early before it gets too hot or probably late afternoon when it cools down a bit. The Forest is open every day from 8.30am-6pm and the price to get in is 40000 IDR, about $3 at the time of writing.\r\n\r\nOnce we paid at the small hut we entered the forest and followed the footpath for about 200 metres where we found a small stone fountain which acts as an anchor point for various trails starting and ending there.\r\n\r\nThis is also where we encountered our first large group of monkeys, they were diving in and out of the water, swimming and fighting for control of the water on such a hot day. This alone could keep me amused for hours.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1665\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1665\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/DSC_2012.jpg\" alt=\"How much does it cost to go into the Ubud monkey forest\" width=\"640\" height=\"404\" \/> Shake it off[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1663\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1663\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/DSC_1974.jpg\" alt=\"monkey forest ubud\" width=\"640\" height=\"339\" \/> Cooling off in the pool[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWithin the forest are various walks to explore further, none of which I'd say are difficult. As we wandered, we discovered stunning moss covered stone statues and small pagodas dotted around as well as a small river. To be honest, I think a lot of the statues have been imported to appease the tourists rather than having any significant history to it but they are still pleasant to look at. Another quick tip for you, wear good shoes, some of the walks can get rather slippery, especially down by the river.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1664\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1664\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/DSC_1994.jpg\" alt=\"Statues in Ubud Monkey Forest\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" \/> Moss covered statues[\/caption]\r\n<h2>Hostage crisis<\/h2>\r\nAs we explored further, I did get the opportunity to enjoy one girl\u2019s misery \u2013 I know, that sounds pretty heartless, but it was her own fault.\r\n\r\nA young Spanish tourist decided it would be a good idea to give a baby monkey a small snack. A very bad idea. What she didn\u2019t realise is that mummy was watching and promptly stole the gift from her little one. I know, not nice mum.\r\n\r\nAnyway, as mummy walked off, she dropped the food on the floor, whether deliberately (I like to think so) or not, the Spanish girl sensed an opportunity to pick it up and give it back to the baby. But it was a trap. No sooner had she touched the food, that mummy was back on the scene and planted a ninja kick to her face, threw an uppercut and went for a bite on the shoulder.\r\n\r\nScreaming as loud as anyone would when under attack from ninja monkey the girl ran away, sadly the wrong way and got herself cornered! She had her back to a building with the only way out next to the wall that mummy monkey now guarded.\r\n\r\nThis is when mummy started to tease her, she sat there with her back to the girl pretending to be uninterested, every movement the girl made she spun around and hissed at her. Meanwhile, the baby monkey just sat there looking desperately at his little monkey paws that only a minute ago had a delicious morsel of food, now nothing.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1673\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1045\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1673\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Monkey-Forest-2.jpg\" alt=\"Can you feed the monkeys in Ubud monkey forest\" width=\"1045\" height=\"628\" \/> Sometimes a mother, sometimes hungry, always protective[\/caption]\r\n\r\nLuckily some of the crowd thought it would be best to get help and tracked down a park attendant who arrived with a big stick to negotiate the release of the hostage.\r\n\r\nGiven ninja monkeys previous moves I thought a stick would not pose much of a problem, but she must know that sticks hurt and after a couple of swings she fled bringing the Ubud monkey hostage crisis to an end. It turns out the tourist did get bitten on the shoulder but the skin wasn\u2019t broken so she should be safe from rabies.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, this is the exact reason that you\u2019ll find some bloggers recommending that you stay away from the place as the monkeys can be aggressive. I\u2019d counter that by saying if you are sensible, hide your food, remember that the monkeys, no matter how fun and cute, are still wild animals you\u2019ll be fine. Zip up your bags, hide your food, don\u2019t tease them, don\u2019t try to feed them, be sensible and you'll be fine.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1666\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"580\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1666\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/DSC_2048.jpg\" alt=\"Can you play with the monkeys in the Ubud monkey forest\" width=\"580\" height=\"480\" \/> Heed the warning[\/caption]\r\n<h2>I wish I took my own advice<\/h2>\r\nHaving said that after our entertainment was over we wandered a bit further and felt a little peckish. I found a safe spot to eat a biscuit; I checked every direction and was feeling confident.\r\n\r\nWe were in an alleyway, no monkeys in front, none behind, an 11-foot wall to the left and long building to the right; we were as secure as we possibly could be. Within seconds of the unwrapping our snack . . . BOOM . . . I received a killer blow as a monkey from nowhere landed on my head.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he touched down that he launched himself at Ron, who was in possession of the packet of biscuits, 360 flipped in mid-air, cartwheeling over his head and snatching the biscuits out of this grasp and fled to the wall. We had just been mugged.\r\n\r\nThen, to rub it in, he just sat there staring at us, munching on my biscuits, eyes saying to me \"come and take these delicious oat cakes back . . . I dare you.\" Luckily the torment didn\u2019t last long as seconds later a group of four more monkeys swooped down, stole the biscuits off him and scarpered . . . Karma bitch!\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1667\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"423\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1667\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/DSC_2053.jpg\" alt=\"Monkey steals things in the monkey forest\" width=\"423\" height=\"640\" \/> Look at him, so proud of stealing my biscuits[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIf only I had had the opportunity to read this blog before visiting the Monkey Forest in Ubud. I would have known do not to get my food out, no matter how safe I thought I was, they are watching, they are always watching, you can't see them, but trust me, they see you!\r\n\r\nDefeated and hungry we left the Monkey Forest to find some real lunch. Sitting at one of the many restaurants overlooking Ubud\u2019s rice fields, we cracked a beer, watched another amazing sunset and laughed. Will Spanish girl will ever go near a monkey again? Lucky little buggar got my delicious oat cakes? Who knows? Cheers!\r\n\r\nLove monkeys too?

I recently visited for a third time with a couple of UK friends. With its stunning Roman aqueduct, imposing Cathedral and impenetrable castle, it never disappoints. So with that said, here are my memories of the day with some tips and information to help you plan your visit.\r\n<h2>Getting the train to Segovia from Chamart\u00edn Station<\/h2>\r\nThe train to Segovia leaves from Madrid\u2019s Chamart\u00edn Station which is easily reachable on the Metro Line 1, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.metromadrid.es\/en\/viaja_en_metro\/red_de_metro\/planos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">click here for the Metro Map<\/a>.\r\n\r\nJust remember, although the Metro is simple to understand, some of the stations appear twice. If you look at the Metro, you\u2019ll notice that there is Chamart\u00edn and Pinar de Chamart\u00edn, the train station is the first one. If you have people visiting and send them to the wrong one, well, that would just cause chaos, not that I have ever done that (sorry Mum and Dad) ?.\r\n\r\nTickets for the train can be bought either <a href=\"http:\/\/www.renfe.com\/EN\/viajeros\/horarios.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">online to be printed at home<\/a> (tickets will be available a maximum of two months before departure) or at the ticket office in Chamart\u00edn Station, located in the middle of the building. Usually you have to grab a number from the machine and wait to be called to purchase your ticket, however, the magic number dispensing machine wasn\u2019t working for us on this visit, so we just joined the queue and hoped for the best.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2201\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2201\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/DSC_0036-640x401.jpg\" alt=\"Buying train ticket for Segovia in Chamartin train station in Madrid\" width=\"640\" height=\"401\" \/> Find the ticket office next to the departure information in the middle of the station[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThere are two sales sections in the ticket office, one for tickets for travel on the day and another for future travel. Be sure to queue at the right one (Spanish for \u2018today\u2019 is \u2018Hoy\u2019 - look for that). The tickets cost just over \u20ac20 for a day return on the high-speed train which takes 28 minutes to reach Segovia.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2202\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2202\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/DSC_0037-640x393.jpg\" alt=\"Buying tickets in Chamartin train station in Madrid\" width=\"640\" height=\"393\" \/> Look for the magic number machine (sign top left in this image) then wait to be called.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nTip - The Spanish rail system is very efficient, I\u2019d recommend buying your tickets a minimum of 15 minutes before travel as you\u2019ll need to get to the platform and go through security checks. Also, try to get to Chamart\u00edn early, as there are often queues at the ticket desk. If you end up with spare time, there are a few little cafes in the station where you can grab a coffee and relax, or go for a wander outside where you can get some great views of the four skyscrapers, iconic of Madrid\u2019s financial district.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2203\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2203\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/DSC_0038-640x409.jpg\" alt=\"Madrid Bull Horn towers\" width=\"640\" height=\"409\" \/> If you have some spare time, take a wander outside of the station to see some of Madrid's iconic buildings such as the 'Bull Horns'[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2204\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2204\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/DSC_0040-640x417.jpg\" alt=\"The Madrid financial district sky scrapers\" width=\"640\" height=\"417\" \/> The financial towers that dominate Madrid's skyline[\/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2217\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"wp-image-2217 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Madrid-24-640x315.jpg\" alt=\"Train from Madrid to Segovia\" width=\"640\" height=\"315\" \/> Spain's big nosed, high-speed trains.[\/caption]\r\n<h2>Getting to Segovia from the train station<\/h2>\r\nThe high-speed train stops at the Segovia-Guiomar station which, rather inconveniently, is located about 8 kms away from the city centre. However, it\u2019s super easy to get to the city, so have no fear. There are two buses that will be waiting, numbers 11 and 12, which both cost \u20ac2 per person. Both will take you to the city centre, the only difference is that the 11 drops you right at the aqueduct (but takes longer) whereas the 12 drops you about a 5 minutes walk away. Don\u2019t worry about where you should get off either, just follow the herd. If you want to see the <a href=\"http:\/\/segovia.avanzagrupo.com\/mapas-de-lineas-y-horarios\/lineas\/linea-12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bus timetables click here<\/a>, select line 11 or 12 and click on Horarios en PDF.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2206\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2206\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/DSC_0043-640x447.jpg\" alt=\"Getting the bus to Segovia from the train station\" width=\"640\" height=\"447\" \/> Buses are likely to be waiting but if there is more than one of you I'd recommend the taxi option[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAnother option would be a taxi. There are normally plenty lined up, waiting for the train drop-offs and expect to pay in the region of \u20ac7 to get to the centre. If there are 4 of you, or you find some people to share with, not only is this option cheaper, it is also a lot more comfortable and quicker.\r\n\r\nTip 2 (go me!) - Now I\u2019m never one for encouraging fast disembarkment. I hate it when an aeroplane lands and so many people do weird yoga-style contortions to grab their luggage and then hang around crushed in the aisle while the crew fiddle with the door. I really don\u2019t understand it. Just relax a few more minutes in comfort - you won\u2019t be trapped in your seat forever to be left to die. Sorry, I got distracted. So, I\u2019m not a fan of rushing to get off, but here I\u2019d recommend it. The bus fills up quickly so to make sure you can get on (and hopefully not have your nose in someone\u2019s sweaty armpit) try to get to it quickly.\r\n\r\nWe only just made it onto the bus and it was a squeeze, I don\u2019t think they have upper safety limits. Even with everyone packed in like a tin of Malagan sardines, there were probably about 40 people left behind to wait, and by the time the bus left, there were no more taxis.\r\n<h2>Segovia\u2019s Aqueduct<\/h2>\r\nAs we left the sweaty armpit fest of the bus we walked up the helpfully named Avenue Aqueducto to the Plaza Azoguejo, where you find the iconic Aqueduct de Segovia as well as Tourist Information and numerous bars and restaurants.\r\n\r\nThe aqueduct is one of Segovia\u2019s main attractions and unmissable. It is why I love the city and what gives it that little extra to make it stand out among many other Madrid day trip options.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2207\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2207\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/DSC_0045-640x440.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting the Aqueduct in Segovia\" width=\"640\" height=\"440\" \/> The aqueduct teases as it slowly comes into view[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe bit you see is just a small part of a stunning construction built by the Romans around the 100AD mark. The original construction was 17 kms long dropping at a consistent 1 degree decline to bring water to the city from the Rio Frio. At its tallest it is nearly 30 meters high and consists of 167 arches. How did they do that? I\u2019m always amazed that with such primitive technology and over rough terrain the Romans delivered 17 kms of water trickling at exactly the right rate to deliver it to a thirsty population - and a fair chunk of their work is still standing. How much do you reckon of what we\u2019re building today will still be around in a couple of millenniums?\r\n\r\nIf you would like to know more about the Aqueduct of Segovia and the legend of how it was built by Lucifer himself, check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spain.info\/en\/reportajes\/el_acueducto_de_segovia_la_huella_del_imperio_romano_en_castilla.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Info Spain page<\/a>.\r\n\r\nOn the far side of the arches you can find the little statue of the she-wolf suckling Romulus and Remus, founders of Rome, that you see on many of the postcards while you wander the city. It was placed here in 1974 and the inscription reads \"Roma a Segovia en el bimilenario de su acueducto MCMLXXIV\". Or in English - \"Rome to Segovia in the bimilenary of its aqueduct 1974\". Kind of tells you all you need to know about it.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2208\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2208\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/DSC_0055-640x427.jpg\" alt=\"Segovia wolf statue of Romulus and Remus\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" \/> The suckling wolf statue of Romulus and Remus, founders of Rome, gifted to the town of Segovia in 1974, from Rome.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nBeing awe-inspired is fine but it was time to get some lunch. One of the oldest and most famous eateries in Segovia is at the base of the Aqueduct called <a href=\"http:\/\/mesondecandido.es\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mes\u00f3n De C\u00e1ndido<\/a>. I have been told it has fantastic cochinillo, the traditional Segovian dish of whole roasted pig. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s delicious . . . but for us it was too expensive so we explored further.\r\n\r\nWe wandered up the street next to it named Calle de San Francisco for about 400 metres where we found a restaurant called Alma Nostra. I\u2019ll often head away from the main area to find restaurants, generally, they will be cheaper and often nicer as they rely on quality rather than location to get customers. We ordered 2 beers, a coffee, three pieces of tortilla and a raci\u00f3n (larger than a single tapas portion) of croquettes to share. All lovely and total bill was just \u20ac13. I\u2019d recommend this place in a heartbeat - we even had very friendly service.\r\n<h2>Walking to the castle<\/h2>\r\nAfter feeding we walked to the opposite side of the historical city core ( a few minutes\u2019 walk), heading towards the castle, or Alc\u00e1zar of Segovia, to give it its proper name. The route takes you up the steps behind the Tourist Office to the top of the aqueduct with some stunning views along the way.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2209\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2209\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/DSC_0057-640x427.jpg\" alt=\"Stunning view of Segovia's Aqueduct\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" \/> Looking back after climbing the steps behind the Segovia Tourist Office[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAs we walked through the backstreets, gaps in the tall, sand coloured buildings either side of us teased with glimpses of what was to come. Before long, narrow streets gave way to the wide open Plaza Mayor, home to lots more restaurants serving cochinillo and Segovia\u2019s impressive 14th century cathedral. Entrance to the Catedral de Segovia costs \u20ac2.50 (no time to go in during this visit but I have heard good things about it).\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2210\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2210\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/DSC_0063-640x427.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting Segovia Cathedral\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" \/> The Cathedral of Segovia dominates the Plaza Mayor[\/caption]\r\n\r\nFrom here it was about an 8-10 minute downhill stroll to Segovia\u2019s castle along Calle Marqu\u00e9s del Arco which became Calle Daioz as we reached the end. On the way, we stopped for a minute or two in Plaza La Merced, a small park which offers nice views looking back to the Cathedral.\r\n<h2>The Segovia Alc\u00e1zar tour<\/h2>\r\nFrom whichever way you look at it, Segovia Alc\u00e1zar is a pretty impressive site. It\u2019s one of the few castles in Spain that currently remain undefeated and has never been taken by enemy forces. Looking at the city walls that need to be conquered before even reaching the moat, I\u2019m not really surprised.\r\n\r\nThe castle tour is definitely worth doing. Entry to the castle is \u20ac5.50 and an extra \u20ac3 for the audio guide which I\u2019d recommend getting as there isn\u2019t too much in the way of explanations or descriptions to read. The guide is full of interesting stories about the history of the castle as well as the local area while still being short enough to hold your attention.\r\n\r\nFor an additional \u20ac2.50, you can buy a ticket to climb the 153 tower steps for spectacular views - the cathedral towering over the city with the snow-capped mountains on the horizon is well worth the fee alone. As I have done the whole tour twice before, I sent my friends into the castle, while I mooched around outside, before joining them to go up the tower. If you\u2019d like more information about the Alc\u00e1zar, check out their website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alcazardesegovia.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http:\/\/www.alcazardesegovia.com<\/a>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2214\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2214\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/DSC_0091-640x427.jpg\" alt=\"Climbing the Segovia Castle tower\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" \/> Stunning views can be found from the top of Segovia's castle.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWhile mooching, I found a small path that led me down below and around the outside of the walls. I walked for a while and was rewarded with some lovely views looking back to the castle. The path continued down to the river below in a circular walk but, conscious of time and growing a thirst, I headed back to the castle caf\u00e9 to enjoy a beer while I waited. The views from the caf\u00e9 garden are pretty impressive too.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2213\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2213\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/DSC_0079-640x416.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting Segovia Castle\" width=\"640\" height=\"416\" \/> Looking to the castle from below the walls[\/caption]\r\n<h2>Wandering the back streets of Segovia<\/h2>\r\nOnce we were finished at the Alc\u00e1zar, we headed back to the main plaza by walking around the walls and stopping off for various refreshment breaks. With so many bars and tapas places trying to tempt us in, it would have been rude not to. I also noticed many boutique food shops selling fantastic locally produced food, including hams and cheeses, as well as wine and beer.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2215\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2215\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/DSC_0101-640x427.jpg\" alt=\"Wandering the streets of Segovia\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" \/> Tall buildings tower over the tiny streets[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOur final stop of the day was back at the aqueduct, this time we did use one of the plaza caf\u00e9s. Sitting down, admiring the ancient feat of engineering while sharing a large jug of sangr\u00eda was a fitting end to a busy, but enjoyable day.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2216\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"wp-image-2216 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/DSC_0106-640x427.jpg\" alt=\"The aqueduct next to Mes\u00f3n De C\u00e1ndido\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" \/> Parting shot, enjoying sangria while looking up and wondering just how?[\/caption]\r\n<h2>Getting back to Madrid<\/h2>\r\nOf course, as much as I\u2019d have loved to have sat there all night enjoying sangr\u00eda while watching the ever evolving hues of the stone aqueduct change as the sun set, we had a train to catch.\r\n\r\nWhether driven by laziness or not wanting my nose pushed in more sweaty armpits (even sweatier at the end of the day) we opted for a taxi back to Segovia-Guiomar train station. They can be found easily with the taxi rank being right next to the aqueduct, opposite the suckling wolf statue. The taxi cost just \u20ac6.80 between us, so only 80 cents more than a bus would have been.\r\n\r\nOur train departed at 6:22pm to get us back in Madrid before 7pm. We arrived a little early to the Segovia train station in the middle of nowhere, but just meant we had time to enjoy one last beer in the station bar.\r\n<h2>In summary<\/h2>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2378\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"200\"]<img class=\"wp-image-2378 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/\u2022segoviain-aday-trip\u2022-1-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting Segovia in a day - check out this pin, it sounds amazing!\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" \/> Love it? Be sure to pin it using the share bar at the top![\/caption]\r\n\r\nSegovia is a wonderful town and I think you\u2019ll be able to see enough of it to be satisfied in a day trip. If visiting for longer (and the place is worth it) there are plenty of cheap, or swanky, hotels in Segovia, whatever suits your budget. There are loads more churches to see, a couple of museums, easily enough to keep you occupied for a few days.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve visited three times now and whenever I have people visit me in Madrid, I will always recommend it to them just as I am recommending to you now.\r\n\r\n<strong>Are you a travel blogger?

Even if I come from Greece, this country still manages to keep me fascinated. The endless summers, the bougainvillea, the whitewashed cobblestone streets of the Cyclades, the bluest skies, the divine beaches, the delicious food, the beautiful unspoiled nature\u2026 how can you not love this country?\r\n\r\nWhen I was asked to write a guide with 20 must see places, initially, I thought damn . . . it\u2019s too much. But when I started typing, 20 seemed like such a small number! But somehow I managed it and here we go:\r\n<h2><strong>Athens<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nPlaka, The Acropolis and the museum, Mt Lycabettus, Benaki Museum, Monastiraki, Syntagma Square, the Parliament and its guards\u2026 just a few places to get a glimpse of Old Greek architecture, history, heritage, and culture. You can\u2019t possibly visit Greece and not pass by its capital city!\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3075\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Parthenon-in-Athens.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting the Parthenon in Athens, Greece\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" \/>\r\n<h2><strong>Santorini<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nOia, Imerovigli, Kaldera, Fira, the black and the red beaches and, of course, the breathtaking sunset. Picturesque, beautiful, popular, amazing, Santorini is worth every penny.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3076\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Santorini-2.jpg\" alt=\"The iconic picture blue rooftops of Santorini\" width=\"640\" height=\"403\" \/>\r\n<h2><strong>Lake Prespa<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nA biosphere reserved site, 2 freshwater lakes shared by 3 countries (Greece, Albania, FYROM). So big, so beautiful and so important due to the endemic species and the wildlife. A must-see natural park, unlike any other \u2013 hey, there are Byzantine monuments!\r\n<h2><strong>Lake Plastira<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nAn artificial lake of blissful landscape and tremendous beauty where you can swim, enjoy, gaze, swim, ride bicycles or horses while admiring the alpine peaks around it! No wonder why they call it \u201cLittle Switzerland\u201d.\r\n<h2><strong>Pelion <\/strong><\/h2>\r\nIt combines the beautiful mountainous Greek landscapes with amazing turquoise water beaches \u2013 because yes, in Greece, that is possible. This mountain has something to offer all year long. Skiing, horseback riding, swimming, hiking... these are only some of the activities you can do there. Amazing hidden villages with traditional guesthouses and gorgeous panoramic views - definitely put Pelion in my top 20 list.\r\n<h2><strong>Meteora<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nShifted focus via the hit series the Game of Thrones but this UNESCO-listed monastery complex was beautiful long before that. The scenery is out of this world and the pictures do not do justice to how amazing this place is. Religious or not, you\u2019ll love it.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3070\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Meteora-Greece.jpg\" alt=\"Meteora is a filming location for Game of Thrones\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" \/>\r\n<h2><strong>Monemvasia<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nThis castle town located in the very south part of Greece's mainland, is carved entirely on a rock in the middle of the sea! Its beauty is undeniable and it oozes romance! Old mansions transformed to traditional or luxurious guest houses, cobblestone streets, and medieval feelings\u2026 one of my absolute favorites worldwide.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3072\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Monemvasia.jpg\" alt=\"The old town of Monemvasia\" width=\"640\" height=\"425\" \/>\r\n<h2><strong>Elafonisos<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nImagine a small island with cloudless skies, golden sand and Caribbean style emerald waters. Peaceful, extremely beautiful and still very pure \u2013 you\u2019ll want to stay there forever! Reachable by a 5-minute ferry ride from the southernmost part of the mainland.\r\n<h2><strong>Lefkada<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nPorto Katsiki and Egkremnoi, Lefkada\u2019s trademark are 2 of the most photographed beaches in the world, are just enough to get you there. But there is more! Nice food, unbelievable sceneries, diversity and quality tourism.\r\n<h2><strong>Mykonos<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nWhat do Little Venice, Nobu, Alessandra Ambrosio, Giorgio Armani and several million dollar yachts have in common? Mykonos, of course. This island is one of the most famous in Europe \u2013 not only Greece \u2013 and for good reasons: magical beaches, epic parties, racism free, Cycladic architecture and a shopper\u2019s paradise.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3069\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Lefkada-Greece.jpg\" alt=\"The beaches of Lefkada Greece are stunning\" width=\"640\" height=\"428\" \/>\r\n<h2><strong>Nafplio <\/strong><\/h2>\r\nI grew up just 12km away from this city and I never appreciated it until I left away from it! Now I can\u2019t wait to go back to my hometown on the weekends and visit Nafplio\u2019s romantic and picturesque old town \u2013 one of the most beautiful in all of Greece, stroll around its little alleys where you feel like you are lost in Venice (due to its architecture) and of course eat gelato and drink coffee in the promenade by the port with views of Boutzi, one of the most photographed sites in Greece. There is great history behind this city and many landmarks and sites of cultural value you can visit. Think about it ;)\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3073\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Nafpilo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" \/>\r\n<h2><strong>Halkidiki<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nLocated in the northern part of the mainland and shaped like Poseidon\u2019s trident, Halkidiki is definitely a must see. Green forests going all the way down to meet the golden sandy beaches with crystal clear waters. An autonomous polity, Mount Athos \u2013 the most important center of Orthodox monasticism. Luxurious resorts, epic parties, and scrumptious food fairly put Halkidiki on the top Greek places list. (PS: part of my honeymoon was spent in Sani.)\r\n<h2><strong>Thessaloniki<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nWe are the only country in the world that has a \u201cco-capital\u201d and that is our beautiful, second largest city, Thessaloniki! There, time flows slower, coffee is a ritual and the food oh-so-good. A cosmopolitan destination with great shopping streets, beautiful architecture, Ottoman and Byzantine monuments \u2013 all in one city. Ps: a walk at Ladadika, a night at any bouzoukia and a pitta with gyro at Savikos are must dos.\r\n<h2><strong>Koufonisia<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nThis two-island complex is ideal for quiet and peaceful vacays away from the crowds. They offer what we Greeks are most proud of: exotic, amazing, endless, pure, beautiful, irresistible beaches. Period.\r\n<h2><strong>Crete<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nElafonisi, Chania, Rethymno, its popular beaches (Kedrodasos, Falassarna, Balos, Elafonisi, Preveli), Knossos and Festos archeological sites and my favorite cuisine from all over Greece. Crete could easily be a country of its own and you should definitely dedicate a few weeks to see everything.

It simply left the road, onto the footpath, honking like crazy as pedestrians fled to get out of the way. begun. Luckily no-one was hurt as the bus sped out of sight leaving the taxi driver and I considering our options as we sat in traffic, motionless, chewing on the dusty pollution wondering whether it is better to bake in a car with no air conditioning or shorten our life expectancy by a few minutes through the onslaught of carbon fumes. Welcome to Nairobi, welcome to my fist ever solo trip, welcome to travelling.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I landed in Nairobi less than 24 hours before on my first ever solo travelling trip. The plan was to fly into Nairobi, out of Johannesburg with a whole lot of adventure in between. Looking back, as a first solo trip it one hell of a learning experience, particularly having lost my wallet, phone and Passport in Dubai airport, but that\u2019s another story.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1912\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/nairobi-354282_640.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1912\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/nairobi-354282_640.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting Nairobi, Kenya\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" \/><\/a> Nairobi from a distance[\/caption]\r\n<h2>Getting a visa at Nairobi Airport, Kenya, is easy<\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nairobi airport, Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, is rather straightforward. You just follow everyone off the plane to the visa desk, pay $50 and pass on through. There are several options on visas into Kenya, so make certain you get the correct one. I had a simple Kenyan tourist visa, but you can also get a transit visa if you are travelling straight through and out of Kenya which I believe is $30 or a multiple entry visa for $70. If you plan to leave Kenya and re-enter make certain you get this one otherwise you will end up paying the full $50 again upon re-entry. Bear this in mind if you are considering of doing a gorilla trek in Uganda and coming back. All of these visas are available for UK citizens at the airport, although other nationalities should probably double check before flying. If is also possible to avoid all this by getting an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thetravellingpinoys.com\/kenya-e-visa\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">e-visa before your visit<\/a>.<\/span>\r\n<h2>Getting a taxi from Nairobi airport is not<\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After clearing immigration I gathered my bag and wandered out of the airport. As soon as I emerged I was accosted by about 15 people all crying \u201cTaxi Taxi\u201d - very intimidating. I didn\u2019t want to get in the first one I came across as I wanted a bit of time to gather my thoughts so I strolled around for a bit but every other step there was someone else wanting you to get into their taxi. The first man to approach me grabbed my arm and tried to drag me to a car, he was leading me to the car park, pointing at his car. It was away from the main taxi area and seemed to be pretty beat up so I chose not to trust him and moved on, in fact, I was somewhat wary about most of them so I made sure I got into one with an official sticker on it. It dawned on me later that I had no idea what an official sticker should look like but I guess the idea was there. After picking my taxi and nearly causing a fight between the guy I chose and the first man that talked to me (apparently if you lie and tell them you are not after a taxi to try and lose them and then get in someone else\u2019s they take offence). Anyway, safely in the cab I was on my way to downtown Nairobi.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ride from the airport turned out to be okay. The taxi driver was a nice guy, we chatted as we sat in traffic, trying our best to stay cool. His driving was pretty erratic, but nothing compared to the aforementioned minibus, I'm still amazed that no-one was destroyed in that manoeuvre, on or off of the bus. It seems that you make your own rules here and I think that will be quite an adjustment.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1914\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/nairobi-647347_640.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1914\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/nairobi-647347_640.jpg\" alt=\"Getting from the airport to Nairobi city\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" \/><\/a> I was in the kind of traffic you see on the left![\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I stayed at The New Oakwood Hotel, very basic and cheap but right in the middle of the city which was convenient but quite loud and unfortunately the TV only had one working channel playing some awful music. I use the term music very liberally. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h2>Walking the streets of the city<\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That evening I went for a walk. The aim was to find the Nairobi train station and buy a ticket for my onward train from Nairobi to Mombassa, but I got lost. As I walked I felt very uncomfortable, I was certainly not in a tourist area and I noticed that almost every shop had guards brandishing an AK-47 or a shotgun outside. Most of the people I walked past on the busy streets seemed fine but every now and again I felt myself receive a look and it just made feel uneasy. As the sun set, I started to feel very nervous, I think this was culture shock setting in, and it was a lot scarier than I expected. I decided it\u2019d be best to head back to the safety of the hotel as I didn\u2019t really know anything about Nairobi, and didn't want to be out alone after dark. I spent the rest of the evening in my hotel, enjoying a meal in the hotel restaurant and the first of many Tusker beers, a rather nice Kenyan brew, while looking ahead to a fresh start in the morning.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1913\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/nairobi-647332_640.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1913\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/nairobi-647332_640.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" \/><\/a> There is currently a lot of investment in the Kenyan Capital[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next morning I thought was an ideal day to do a spot of exploring around Nairobi but I didn\u2019t know where I was. I asked the receptionist in the hotel if they had a map, which they didn\u2019t, but he told me of a tourist information place just around the corner where I could get a map of the city, so off I trotted.<\/span>\r\n<h2>Finding a map of Nairobi is harder than you think<\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the problems with Nairobi seems to be everyone wants to \"offer\" you something, be it a whistle to get your attention followed by calls of \"taxi taxi\" or just a quick chat and then ask for money. My destination was within 400 metres and as I was walked I counted three separate people offering me taxi before a guy came up to me, right outside the tourist office, and asked me what I was after. I explained that I just wanted a map and walked straight past him into the tourist office.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once in there, the lady told me they had no maps but told me someplace else that would and pointed to the guy who I ignored outside as someone who could show me where. I thought it strange that a place advertising tourist information had no maps, but given that the hotel I stayed in pointed me this way I trusted the place and wandered off with the guy from outside and learnt his name was Charles and he would go on to become a good friend.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you would like to continue reading about my experience in Nairobi, how to buy a train ticket and whether I survived the whole experience, please follow the link to be taken to part two and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/guided-walking-tour-nairobi\/\">my walking tour of Nairobi.<\/a>\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h2>Find more in my book<\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The blog above is based on a chapter of my Kindle book: How To Clean Your Underwear in Africa; Diary of an unskilled traveller.

The nice manicured tarmac turned into a winding mountain road, often narrowing to a single lane with steep drops off the edge. The views were spectacular, the pointed mountain tops on the horizon beyond the tree covered valley in front . . . although I couldn\u2019t pay too much attention for the fear of mistiming a switchback corner to an untimely death.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suddenly from nowhere our home for the evening, Monsagro, appeared. The whole village is \u00a0hidden by the mountains until you turn the final corner into it. The only sign of life was the smoke rising from the chimney pots to counter the chill on this cool Spring evening.<\/span>\r\n<h2><strong>The village of Monsgaro<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3231\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Monsagro-004.jpg\" alt=\"The village of Monsagro\" width=\"650\" height=\"370\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monsagro is one of many handsome villages scattered throughout the Sierra de Francia, a range of foothills acting as the entrance to Spain\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sistema_Central\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sistema Central mountain range<\/a>.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most famous landmark in the region is the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spain.info\/en\/que-quieres\/arte\/monumentos\/salamanca\/santuario_de_nuestra_senora_de_la_pena_de_francia.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Santuario de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Pe\u00f1a de Francia<\/a>\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(from here on referred to simply as La Pe\u00f1a as I really can\u2019t be bothered to write all that out every time). It is a Catholic Church and Sanctuary which sits atop the Pe\u00f1a de Francia, and is visible from many of the surrounding villages. Pe\u00f1a de Francia<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is the common term people use when referring to the monastery, although Pe\u00f1a actually simply means rocky hill.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3232\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Monsagro-016.jpg\" alt=\"View looking back to Monsagro in the Sierra de Francia Mountains, Salamanca Spain\" width=\"650\" height=\"315\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We were staying in the small village of Monsagro, just 17kms away from La Pe\u00f1a. We are lucky Raquel\u2019s (my other half) parents live here when they are not in Madrid so we have a place to stay. However, there are a couple of great options aside from Raquel\u2019s mum (although I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be happy to look after you too!). There are some self-catering apartments, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.booking.com\/hotel\/es\/apartment-sierra-de-francia.html?aid=1286843&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=2&amp;room1=A%2CA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apartamentos Sierra de Francia<\/a>, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or a small hotel, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.booking.com\/hotel\/es\/rural-valle-agadon.html?aid=1286843&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=2&amp;room1=A%2CA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hotel Rural Valle Agadon<\/a>, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">run by the lovely Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9, complete with dining room and terrace with stunning views over the village.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the centre of the village is a small village square, home for the many celebrations held throughout the year, as well as a small museum that celebrates the local wildlife and the family history in the village. However, the village's claim to fame is the use of fossils in the buildings. In fact, it has its own fossil route and downloadable app, you can find out more about this soon in my post about the villages of Sierra de Francia.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Visiting the Santuario de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Pe\u00f1a de Francia <\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So after a good catch up with the family and a hearty breakfast, we were ready to head to La Pe\u00f1a. From Monsagro it\u2019s about a 4-hour hike with a couple of different route options, so if you set off early you can be there in time for a mid-morning snack or lunch. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternatively, you can do what we did and do the 20-minute drive.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The road continued to impress as the scary drops to oblivion kept me focused. If you\u2019re lucky you may spot some of the mountain goats and their impressive curved horns scurrying up and down the mountainside.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3233\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"650\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-3233\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Mountain-goat-Salamanca.jpg\" alt=\"Mountain Goats in the Sierra de Francia's\" width=\"650\" height=\"400\" \/> This one wasn't too horny, but others are[\/caption]\r\n<h2><b>Mirador de los Lobos<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just before the turn to head up to La Pe\u00f1a, there is a great viewpoint, Mirador de los Lobos, a spot to take some lovely pictures looking up to the monastery or of the expansive views beyond.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3237\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Pena-De-Francia-10.jpg\" alt=\"Looking up to La Pena de Francia\" width=\"650\" height=\"377\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the outside, La Pe\u00f1a is nothing special to look at. No amazing architecture (if you look past the fact it\u2019s built on a 1700m mountain) and I only felt a tinge of disappointment when I discovered that the tall tower is actually for the region's TV signal, not a rocket ship to heaven. However, as I mentioned, it is built up high, and here\u2019s why.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3230\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"650\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-3230\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/La-Pena.jpg\" alt=\"The Tv Tower at La Pena de Francia\" width=\"650\" height=\"400\" \/> TV tower, not a rocket ship to Heaven[\/caption]\r\n<h2><b>How Simon Vela founded La Pe\u00f1a de Francia<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to legend, the location of La Pe\u00f1a isn\u2019t a random accident. There was this guy, <a href=\"http:\/\/www2.dominicos.org\/pdefrancia\/pagines\/SimonVela.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Simon <\/a>Vela<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who was of great religious devotion and he found a Romanesque image of the Virgin Mary on the spot that La Pe\u00f1a now sits in 1434 after having a dream and being told where to find it. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What makes the Virgin of the Rock of France (its English name) special is that it is a <a href=\"https:\/\/udayton.edu\/imri\/mary\/b\/black-madonnas-origin-history-controversy.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Black Madonna<\/a>.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0There are only about 500 of these in Europe and seem to have an almost cult-like status. In fact, the Virgin of La Pe\u00f1a has shrines dedicated to it in many countries including Brazil, The Philippines, India, Mexico and more.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3228\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"650\"]<img class=\"wp-image-3228 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/La-Pena-1-e1507406233759.jpg\" alt=\"Salamanca and La Pena de Francia\" width=\"650\" height=\"359\" \/> As you climb the view are stunning[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So once Simon had the icon he built a chapel on the spot (which still exists) and the rest of La Pe\u00f1a built up around that. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The original Virgin was actually stolen in 1872 but then returned under the seal of confession in 1889. Sadly it had heavily deteriorated and a new one was made. However, the original is actually encased in the new version and if you look closely, apparently you can just about see the original one inside through a small hole on the left-hand side.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3236\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"650\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-3236\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Pena-De-Francia-08.jpg\" alt=\"The Courtyard of La Pena de Francia\" width=\"650\" height=\"359\" \/> The Courtyard[\/caption]\r\n<h2><b>The Church<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once we had parked our car, it was just a short uphill stroll the church. We immediately noticed the dip in temperature, the additional 900 metres altitude from Monagro had really put a nip in the air of an otherwise cloudless, blue sky day.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I loved the church as it is very understated. There are no large gold-covered altars or jewel-encrusted icons, just a simple church with a Black Madonna. I\u2019ll be honest, sometimes I get really angry with how much wealth the church have sitting around in the form of gold and other decorations. They are not really needed, especially when so many of the church's followers live in poverty. Sell some of it and help them out. Sorry, rant over.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opposite the church is a large building that has bedrooms (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.booking.com\/hotel\/es\/hospederia-pena-de-francia-el-cabaco.html?aid=1286843&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=2&amp;room1=A%2CA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">you can actually <\/a>stay)<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a small Caf\u00e9 which has tables outside for the warmer days and the obligatory gift shop.<\/span>\r\n<h2><strong>The views from\u00a0La Pe\u00f1a<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3229\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"650\"]<img class=\"wp-image-3229 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/La-pena-de-Francia-cafe.jpg\" alt=\"View from the outside cafe tables\" width=\"650\" height=\"400\" \/> View from the outside cafe tables[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the true beauty of La Pe\u00f1a is the site itself. The far side of the complex is where there are panoramic views of the landscape and villages for miles into the distance. A really nice touch are the helpful markers on top of the wall which told us which village we were gazing down upon from our high vantage point.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3239\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"650\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-3239\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/View-from-La-Pena.jpg\" alt=\"The Villages of La Pena de Francia\" width=\"650\" height=\"433\" \/> Handy markers tell you what village you are gazing upon[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s rare these days to find such a site that is free to enjoy. I\u2019d highly recommend it as a stop on any visit to the region, even if simply to stand and absorb the calm peaceful feeling and you admire the expansive views as eagles soar below you. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OK, that last bit about eagles may be overselling it, but an eagle definitely flew below our line of sight while we were there.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3234\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"650\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-3234\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Pena-De-Francia-05.jpg\" alt=\"Above the eagles in La Pena\" width=\"650\" height=\"411\" \/> See, eagle, just about below us[\/caption]\r\n<h2><b>Getting there<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">La Pe\u00f1a de Francia is around a 1 hour 20-minute drive from Salamanca or about 45 minutes from Ciudad Rodrigo. There are buses that go there but I\u2019d imagine if you find yourself in this area you will probably be in a car, that\u2019s a much better recommendation. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for when to visit, I\u2019d recommend spring or autumn as it does get rather popular in the summer months. But remember to check the conditions before heading there because there can be late snow and the road becomes almost impassable.<\/span>\r\n<h2><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/pvGa95Xcb6Y\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n<strong>Are you a Travel Blogger?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nIf you want your blog to be added to our map be sure to check out our submit your blog page here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/submit-your-blog\">https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/submit-your-blog<\/a>\r\n<h2><strong>More of The Travel Blogs original content<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n[pt_view id=\"cd68648ga2\"]","post_title":"La Pe\u00f1a de Francia - A mountaintop Monastery","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"la-pena-de-francia-mountain-monastery","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2017-10-11 09:49:16","post_modified_gmt":"2017-10-11 09:49:16","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/?p=3225","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"10","filter":"raw","animate_tooltips":true,"animate_pinpoints":true,"google_coords":["40.510729","-6.175797200000034","10"],"pin_image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/The-Travel-Blogs-Original-Content.png","size":{"0":30,"1":40,"2":3,"3":"width=\"30\" height=\"40\"","bits":8,"mime":"image\/png"},"anchor":[15,40]},"pin_city":"Monsagro","pin_zip":"","data_tags":{"543":543},"popup_enabled":false,"tooltip_enabled":true,"tooltip_close":"auto","tooltip_content":"<p><strong>La Pe\u00f1a de Francia - A mountaintop Monastery<\/strong><br \/>Hidden gem in Western Spain, stunning mountaintop monastery<\/p>\n"},{"ID":1937,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2017-04-04 08:43:44","post_date_gmt":"2017-04-04 08:43:44","post_content":"I have my first award! Cue the trumpets, unroll the banners, I have finally made it. Let this be the first of many!\r\n\r\nI want to start by saying a massive thank you to Lena Dre, from - <a href=\"https:\/\/fouronaworldtrip.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/fouronaworldtrip.com<\/a> - for nominating me for this award. Of course, I am more than happy to receive it and help spread the love!\r\n\r\nSo what is a Liebster Award? OK, so I don\u2019t have a golden medal in my trophy cabinet just yet, well, for blogging anyway, but what\u2019s cool about the Liebster Award is that is is not something that you apply for, it is something that is given to you by fellow bloggers, it\u2019s recognition from a peer within the blogosphere which means a lot to me. Unless you have ever blogged, you probably do not realise how much work goes into running these things. We all started like \u201cYeah, it will be awesome, I\u2019ll share my stories, people will love them\u201d. Next step you get your URL and start writing. Then nothing. You realise people don\u2019t come to you, you have to find them. So you spend the next couple of month trying to become an expert in SEO (Basically waving to Google shouting \u201cOi, over here, that person that searched for that would love to read this\u201d). Then after two months, you realise you hate the design of your website and spend days playing with themes, tweaking this and that until it\u2019s perfect at which point you realise you haven\u2019t actually written a blog for three weeks.\r\n<h1>My Liebster Award Questions<\/h1>\r\nWhat I guess I\u2019m trying to say is it feels good to be found. So what do I do next? Well as part of my Liebster nomination I get to answer 11 questions that were given to me by Lena about my travels, followed by 11 random facts and finally I get to nominate people myself for the award. So without further ado, here goes:\r\n\r\n<strong>1. How many countries have you visited so far?<\/strong>\r\n36\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Why are you blogging?<\/strong>\r\nWhile travelling I found it difficult to find enjoyable blogs from an area I was in. That\u2019s when I thought it would be cool to have loads of great blogs based on a map so you can find where you are and then find blogs from the local area. I wanted it to be a hub to share blogs as well as a place for my own content.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Name your top 3 items that you consider most useful when travelling?<\/strong>\r\niPad for keeping my diary. Camera, I never go anywhere without it and a bottle opener, you never know when you may be called upon to be a hero.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. What was your best trip?<\/strong>\r\nTrip is such a big word so I\u2019ll shift it down to moment. Although there were so many highlights one hat stands out was my visit to the Monkey Temple in Lopburi. I love the cheeky little buggers, and watching them run, play and terrorise other visitors was a lot of fun. I particularly enjoyed watching the two bank security guards trying to retrieve a mobile phone from the monkey sat up a pole. Check it out here if you want to read more about it!\r\n\r\n<strong>5. What was your worst trip?<\/strong>\r\nThe disappointment of Ha Long Bay. It is one of those images that I have had in my head my entire life, an image that inspired me to travel. We were in Hanoi and short on time so we booked a day trip. It involved waking up at 4 am in the morning and a 3 and a half hour bus ride each way. When we finally got the dock to board our day cruise through the iconic limestone towers, we were told all boats were cancelled due to an impending typhoon. We spend three hours on the dock in \u2018will we won\u2019t we\u2019 stasis before boarding the bus for a three and a half hour drive back to Hanoi.\r\n\r\n<strong>6. What is your advice for people new to travelling?<\/strong>\r\nIf you are going to a country, do some research and respect their customs. If you walk along the street in Myanmar wearing a mini-skirt, don\u2019t be surprised if people stare at you and you feel uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n<strong>7. What do you find most annoying when travelling?<\/strong>\r\nPeople who put their aeroplane seats all the way back. Yes, I know you can, but to me, it just shows a lack of empathy for the people behind you, it\u2019s a real dick move. That and people listening to headphones too loudly.\r\n\r\n<strong>8. What is your dearest travel memory?<\/strong>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has to be meeting Jimmy at Jimmy\u2019s school in Siem Reap. He runs a school for street children. So many families can\u2019t afford to send their kids to school as they have to be out on the streets, selling to tourists, trying to make money just to survive. Jimmy\u2019s place is an evening school that is free and teaches English to the kids. His dream is to one day have some of his students go to university, but just by giving the kids a place to meet in the evening with other kids, learn the language, feel safe and have fun, he is doing something amazing. He often provides food for the kids as well, relieving some of the pressure from the families and he does it all with money made from his Tuk Tuk business and donations. If you would like to know more about Jimmy I\u2019d love you to take a look at my blog about it here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/discovering-jimmys-school-siem-reap\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/discovering-something-special-siem-reap<\/a><\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>9. Do you prefer to travel solo or with a friend\/partner and why?<\/strong>\r\nHonestly, I prefer travelling solo, I like the freedom of being able to make a decision of where you want to go without having to agree all the time. I have travelled both ways and have had great experiences. Having a travel buddy definitely has its plus points, but I like the adventure.\r\n\r\n<strong>10. How are you choosing your travel destinations?<\/strong>\r\nI don\u2019t really know if I have a method. I guess based mainly on recommendations.\r\n\r\n<strong>11. What're your preferred means of transport?<\/strong>\r\nI love to travel by train, watching the world pass by from the track. It could be to do with being the son of a train spotter, but probably more that I actually hate flying and although I wouldn\u2019t compare myself to those that have a genuine phobia, I get very nervous and do not enjoy it.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1938\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/20131222_0846-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"how to win a Liebster Award\" width=\"600\" height=\"341\" \/>\r\n<h1>11 Random facts for the Liebster Award<\/h1>\r\nI have a wine qualification\r\nI play hockey and until recently American Football (I have a medal for that)\r\nI love having my back scratched\r\nI have a book on Amazon called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/gp\/product\/1492397717\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=1492397717&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=totalmarli-21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How To Clean Your Underwear in Africa<\/a>\r\nI support Torquay United Football Club\r\nWhenever I see the video to Gangnam Style I get kind of hypnotised and can\u2019t turn it off.\r\nMy dad was a photographer and my mum a journalist before they retired\r\nI was born in Bury St Edmunds\r\nI have lived in Florida, Colorado and now live in Madrid, Spain\r\nI eat way too many sweets\r\nI really miss British beer living in Spain\r\nI am too lazy to count\r\nI always make the sensible decision when buying things like buying the higher spec computer rather than the pretty one the spins and then always regret it.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1939\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Liebster-Award-blog.jpg\" alt=\"Liebster award nomination what is it\" width=\"800\" height=\"458\" \/>\r\n<h1>Liebster Award rules<\/h1>\r\nOnce you accept a nomination, you are expected to complete the following steps:\r\n* Thank and link to the blogger who nominated you.\r\n* Create a post on your blog, displaying the Liebster Award logo.\r\n* Answer the 11 questions assigned by the blogger who nominated you.\r\n* Give 11 random facts about you.\r\n* Provide rules\/instructions for accepting the award.\r\n* Nominate at most 6 new favourite bloggers for the Liebster Award.\r\n* Come up with a list of 11 new questions for your nominees.\r\n* Notify the nominees.\r\n* Post your Liebster Award blog post link in the comments of your nominator\u2019s Liebster Award Post\r\n<h2>Questions to my nominees<\/h2>\r\nWhere are you right now?\r\nWhere are you going next?\r\nWhat ignited the fire inside of you that burns for travel?\r\nWhat is the funniest thing that you ever witnessed in an airport?\r\nWhat is the best food you have had outside of your own country?\r\nWhat is your favourite animal and why?\r\nHow long have you blogged?\r\nWhat camera do you use?\r\nBeach, mountains or city?\r\nWhat is the furthest you have ever been from home?\r\nWhere do you see your blog in 12 months time?\r\n<h2>So who to nominate?<\/h2>\r\nWe live in a time where we are spoilt for choice in travel blogging, so many great writers sharing their love of travel.

I was there on an overnight stop as part of a five day organised safari tour that started in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/visiting-devils-pool-victoria-falls\/\">Livingstone, Zambia<\/a>, and ended in Johannesburg, South Africa. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tour was the final leg of my trip through Africa and was a great way to end it, especially as I had to fly home from J\u2019berg. Not only did it make sure I was in J\u2019berg on time, the day before my flight (something that can\u2019t be said very often when talking about African transport) but I also got to meet great people along the way and really enjoyed the final days of my solo African adventure.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3730\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/The-overland-safari-vehicle.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" \/>\r\n<h2><b>It always starts with a bloody tent<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with most stops on these safaris, the first job after arriving is putting up the tents. After a few days, it becomes a\u00a0real pain in the arse. I would love to be able to say I got better at it each day and it got easier . . . but it didn\u2019t.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily I could rely on the help of the others. On reflection, it must have been that I had a bad tent.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another tenting skill I also didn\u2019t master was choosing the right spot. A day earlier I had managed to camp on an ants nest and was still finding hundreds of the little buggers hitching along with me. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the ground hard and dusty, if I hadn\u2019t been so poor, due to a complete lack of budgeting skill, I would have certainly ended up in one of Elephant Sand\u2019s lodges rather than my ant-ridden tent.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After receiving the very welcome safety advice, I finally decided on a safe place to pitch my tent before heading to the bar area for a couple of well-earned beers and a spot of elephant watching.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3728\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/The-pool-at-Elephant-Sands-Campsite.jpg\" alt=\"Elephant sands swimming pool\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" \/>\r\n<h2><b>The Elephant Sands watering Hole<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campsite (and more importantly campsite bar) is on a raised terrace area with a swimming pool and located about 20 metres away from a watering hole. When our group arrived there must have been at least 12 elephants, bathing, spraying and in general having a pretty good time. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They would often inquisitively wander over to us, within touching distance, I had to keep reminding myself that they are wild elephants, so although I really wanted to grab some trunk, I thought I best err on the side of caution.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3726\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Getting-close-to-wild-elephats-at-elephant-sands.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" \/>\r\n<h2><b>Attack of the African wild dogs<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was while watching the elephants I noticed something on the horizon, smaller than an elephant. Then a second and a third, it was a pack of wild dogs and they wanted what the elephants had . . . the water.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A couple of the wild dogs approached, but the elephants didn\u2019t want to share and chased them off. I thought that\u2019s pretty cool, wild dogs are quite rare to see.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3725\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-3725\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/African-wild-dogs-lurk.jpg\" alt=\"Wild dogs attack elephants\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" \/> Wild dogs lurk in the trees, wish I could have taken a better photo[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But before I could get my next beer I heard a commotion as the whole pack, around 25 dogs, charged the watering hole. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Startled, the elephants retreated and stood back, watching the dogs. Every now and again an elephant would make a half-hearted attempt to scare the dogs away, running towards them, trumpeting and putting on a show. But it would take just one dog to growl and stand its ground and the elephant would slink back off.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>The elephants fight back<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, after about 10 minutes of watching the dogs, they decided enough was enough. A group of them charged together as the dogs stood firm, but this time, as two pulled up, the third elephant, a bull and the biggest of the bunch kept on going, water and dogs flew in every direction! The rest of the elephants saw their opportunity and dashed into the water. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With no other option, the dogs retreated.

wasn\u2019t until I knelt down to take a photo of an exceptionally handsome monkey that they decided to investigate me.\r\n\r\nWhile checking that my aperture was set I felt an unexpected jolt on my back which coincided with an abrupt squeak from my friend. I knew right away I had a monkey on my back.\r\n\r\nLuckily in the aforementioned blog that I read, it suggested that to remove monkeys, simply rotate at speed and the monkeys will fly off you in all directions. It worked; monkey on \u2026 spin \u2026monkey off.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1429\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1000\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1429 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/FotorCreated.jpg\" alt=\"Groomed by a monkey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"459\" \/> Being bombarded by the little buggers[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIt seemed after this initial breach I was now thought of\u00a0as\u00a0fair game. I am not sure if the others saw and assumed I was carrying something\u00a0worth having but all of a sudden I had three monkeys bundling on me.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, I learnt\u00a0to accept\u00a0it and enjoy the experience, especially the one that sat on my back and groomed me hunting for ticks, I felt a genuine closeness to nature, almost as if I was one of their crew. In total, we spent about an hour\u00a0in the monkey temple before we had a wander around the town.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1434\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1434 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/20131222_0815-1.jpg\" alt=\"monkey stole a phone\" width=\"640\" height=\"458\" \/> Where do I find the phone book on this thing?[\/caption]\r\n<h2><strong>Then this happened . . .<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nAs we made motions to leave and head back to the train station, I noticed\u00a0a lady pulling up to the local bank on her moped with an interesting looking plastic bag on her handlebars.\r\n\r\nWithin moments, a curious little bugger had ripped the bag open and grabbed what was inside. The immense disappointment was clear on both sides as the poor lady had just lost her brand new mobile phone and the monkey; as much as he tried, couldn\u2019t eat it.\r\n\r\nSensing the imminent danger from the bank security he scarpered with his bounty, edible or not, straight to the top of a post.\r\n\r\nThe bank team were extremely helpful in trying to get the phone back. The tactic they used was tossing a small packet of rice at the monkey in the hope that he would catch the rice and drop the phone.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1435\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"355\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1435 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/20131222_0817-1-e1483810752874.jpg\" alt=\"Monkey with phone\" width=\"355\" height=\"450\" \/> Hello . . . anyone there? I'd like to report a robbery.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of throws, they were right in one sense; the monkey caught the rice, however now he had a phone and a bag of rice.\r\n\r\nThe guards, seeming disappointed, had to play their trump card . . . a fine ripe mango . . . game on.\r\n<h2><strong>Mango Vs. Rice Vs. Phone<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nThe first mango toss got the monkeys attention but was off target. The following attempt was a big success; you could see the monkey making a calculation in his brain, rice vs. mango . . . versus calling his mum.\r\n\r\nIt was no contest, as he seized the mango out of mid-air he dropped the phone and the guard\u00a0was able to catch it, aside from a couple of teeth marks; good as new.\r\n\r\nBetween the lady losing a bag of food and the monkey stealing a phone it was rather an eventful trip and with that number of monkeys around I\u2019m sure there will always be some shenanigans going on.\r\n<h2>Loburi Monkey Temple Festival<\/h2>\r\nIf you want to know more about Lopburi and the locals' attitude to the macaques be sure to watch this quick little video.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/J9ki0mK6NQ0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n<h2><strong>Are you a Travel Blogger?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nIf you want your blog to be added to our map be sure to check out our submit your blog page here:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/submit-your-blog\">https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/submit-your-blog<\/a>\r\n<h2><strong>Latest Travel Blogs Original Content<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n[pt_view id=\"cd68648ga2\"]\r\n<h2><strong>More from The Travel Blogs in Asia<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n[pt_view id=\"7f3015djep\"]\r\n<h2><\/h2>","post_title":"Visiting the Lopburi Monkey Temple Thailand","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"lopburi-monkey-temple-thailand","to_ping":"","pinged":"\nhttps:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/exploring-monkey-temple-lopburi-video\/","post_modified":"2018-02-15 08:17:26","post_modified_gmt":"2018-02-15 08:17:26","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/?p=192","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"23","filter":"raw","animate_tooltips":true,"animate_pinpoints":true,"google_coords":["14.803035","100.6139958","10"],"pin_image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/The-Travel-Blogs-Original-Content.png","size":{"0":30,"1":40,"2":3,"3":"width=\"30\" height=\"40\"","bits":8,"mime":"image\/png"},"anchor":[15,40]},"pin_city":"Lopburi","pin_zip":"","data_tags":{"406":406,"22":22},"popup_enabled":true,"tooltip_enabled":true,"tooltip_close":"auto","tooltip_content":"<p><strong>Visiting the Lopburi Monkey Temple Thailand<\/strong><\/p>\n"},{"ID":4099,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2018-01-04 10:00:46","post_date_gmt":"2018-01-04 10:00:46","post_content":"As Colombia continues it's travel renaissance, Cartagena de Indias is quickly emerging as one of\u00a0the worlds hot destinations.\u00a0This guide to the city has been written by Sasha who, with his wife Rachel, runs the travel blog\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gratefulgypsies.com\/\">Grateful Gypsies<\/a>.\r\n\r\nStarting off with a little bit of history, the post continues with the best places to visit in Cartagena as well as advice about where to stay, what to eat, nightlife and so much more.

Thanks to its strategic location, Cartagena became a major trading port that helped to expand the Spanish empire. Silver from Peru was exported, while African slaves were imported. This made it an easy target for pirates, which led to the building of a defensive wall and several fortifications along the coast. For further protection, the Castillo de San Felipe was built in 1657. You won\u2019t find pirates in Cartagena these days, but you can still walk on the old city walls and visit the fortress.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4112\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"700\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4112 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Simon-Bolivar.jpg\" alt=\"A statue of Simon Bolivar\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" \/> A statue of Simon Bolivar - a common sight in South America.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nFast forward to November 11, 1811, and Cartagena became only the second city in South America to claim its independence from Spain. It took a few more years, but independence became official with the help of \u201cThe Liberator\u201d Simon Bolivar when he incorporated Colombia into the confederation of Gran Colombia. In Bolivar Park, you\u2019ll find a statue of him on horseback with one of his famous quotes - \u201cCartagenians: If Caracas gave me life, Cartagena gave me glory.\u201d\r\n<h2><strong>Free Walking Tours<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4110\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"700\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4110 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Explore-Cartagena.jpg\" alt=\"Free walking tours of Cartagena\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" \/> Explore the town with a local guide to learn more.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe best way to learn about the city\u2019s history is by joining one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freewalkingtourcartagena.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">daily free walking tours<\/a>. They\u2019re led by friendly, knowledgable local guides every day of the week at 10 AM and again at 4 PM. Even though the tours are free, it\u2019s advised to reserve a spot ahead of time as they cap the group size. Tours last a few hours and provide a fantastic introduction to the city. If you enjoy the tour, be sure to leave a decent tip for your hardworking guide.\r\n<h2><strong>Exploring the Old Town<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nOnce you\u2019ve learned all about Cartagena on the tour, exploring the Old Town on your own will be even more rewarding. For example, you\u2019ll know what the several different designs on the door knockers mean. These beautiful door knockers (known as aldabas) signify what the family living there was known for. A mermaid or seahorse signifies a merchant, a lion is for military members, and a lizard is a sign of royalty.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4108\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"700\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4108 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Colourful-door-Cartagena.jpg\" alt=\"Colourful doors can be found all over the city\" width=\"700\" height=\"525\" \/> Royalty must have lived here![\/caption]\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s plenty more to see and do in the Old Town, including several museums, churches, and art galleries. In between, you can just walk around and admire the beautiful homes covered in bougainvillaea - a tropical, shrub-like vine covered in colorful flowers. Make sure you have your batteries charged up, because these make for some great photos.\r\n\r\nThe Old Town is very much the center of tourism in Cartagena, and this is where you\u2019ll find the bulk of accommodation, shopping, dining, and nightlife. Places here tend to be a bit on the pricier side, though. Backpackers may want to consider basing themselves in another funky neighborhood not far outside the city walls.\r\n<h2><strong>Getsemani<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4111\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"700\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4111 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Getsemani-street-art.jpg\" alt=\"Discover amazing street art in the area of Getsemani\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" \/> Cool street art is around every corner in Getsemani.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThis traditional Colombian \u2018hood is quickly emerging as a backpacker hotspot in Cartagena. Full of hostels, street art, and super friendly locals, it\u2019s a very welcoming place to call home for your visit. The main square here is buzzing at night with locals and tourists alike. Here you can grab some cheap street food and hit a Happy Hour while you watch break dancers bust a move. If you\u2019re looking to class it up a bit, there are several great restaurants to choose from here as well.\r\n<h2><strong>Bocagrande<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4101\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"700\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4101 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Bocagrande-beach-Cartagena.jpg\" alt=\"The Beach at Bacagrande\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" \/> Beach lovers will want to stay here in Bocagrande.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThose looking for more sun and sand on their Cartagena trip may want to consider staying in the Bocagrande area. You don\u2019t have to stay in one of the fancy hotels to base yourself near the beach, as you can find furnished apartments on Airbnb for a fraction of the price. The beaches here aren\u2019t the best, but it\u2019s hard to beat sipping on cold beers, munching on seafood, and listening to the sounds of the ocean and wandering musicians.\r\n<h2><strong>Out of Town<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for those white sand beaches with crystal clear water, you\u2019ll have to head out of town a bit. Every travel agent in the city has day trips to Playa Blanca, or you can just catch a boat from the port in the morning. Another popular option for a day tour is the Volcan del Totumo, where you can jump in the mud bath that's said to rejuvenate your skin.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4106\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"700\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4106 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Casa-en-el-Agua-Cartagena.jpg\" alt=\"Visit the Casa En El Agua in Cartagena\" width=\"700\" height=\"525\" \/> The amazing Casa en el Agua.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThose with a few days to spare may want to consider booking a stay at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gratefulgypsies.com\/casa-en-el-agua\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Casa en el Agua<\/a>. This eco-hostel out in the middle of the ocean is the perfect place to chill out after a busy couple of days exploring the city. Spend your days sunbathing, snorkeling, and visiting nearby beaches, and then enjoy dinner and drinks with the other lucky travelers who managed to snag a coveted spot at this little slice of paradise.\r\n<h2><strong>Food and Drink in Cartagena<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nAs it\u2019s on the coast, it should come as no surprise that seafood is big in Cartagena. Those on a budget will want to stick to local joints called corrientes, which feature set menus that typically run about $3-4 and include fish, coconut rice, fried plantains, and salad.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4107\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"700\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4107 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Ceviche.jpg\" alt=\"Eating in Cartagena\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" \/> Mmmm\u2026 ceviche![\/caption]\r\n\r\nWith so many good restaurants here, you\u2019ve got to splurge on at least one meal. Fans of American chef and TV star Anthony Bourdain may want to check out <a href=\"http:\/\/lacevicheriacartagena.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">La Cevecheria<\/a>, where the host dined on an episode of his former show \u201cNo Reservations.\u201d It ain\u2019t cheap, but it\u2019s well worth it.\r\n\r\nDown in Bocagrande, there\u2019s a fantastic local joint called Guatila. It\u2019s very unassuming and easy to miss from the outside, but don\u2019t let the simple appearance fool you. This is real deal Colombian home cooking. Sit down to a perfect plate of seafood coconut rice or a bowl of the mouth-watering mote de queso - a rich cheese soup typical on the coast.\r\n<h2><strong>Nightlife<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nIf you\u2019re looking to let loose at night, Cartagena is a damn good place to be. Once the sun goes down, you\u2019ll start to hear the roar of the Chiva buses. These colorful open-air buses whisk tourists around town with music blasting and cocktails flowing. They\u2019re a great way to meet people and get a little tour of the city at night while you get your buzz on.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4109\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"700\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4109 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/dancing-in-Cartagena.jpg\" alt=\"Salsa parties in Cartagena\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" \/> People are dancing everywhere in Cartagena.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nCartagena is all about the salsa, and there\u2019s no shortage of places to go tear up the dance floor. One of the most popular spots to dance the night away is Cafe Havana, which is packed to the brim on weekends. If you\u2019ve got two left feet, never fear - there are plenty of places where you can take lessons before trying out your moves in public.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4104\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"700\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4104 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Cartagena-Nightlife.jpg\" alt=\"Where to go in the evening\" width=\"700\" height=\"525\" \/> One of the coolest bars in town.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe city is also home to a wide variety of bars and clubs. One of the most interesting places to grab a drink has to be the <a href=\"https:\/\/cartagena.tips\/en\/best-themed-bars-in-cartagena-kgb-kofee-gallery-bar\/\">KGB Bar<\/a>. Located opposite one of the city\u2019s many churches, this theme bar is full of Soviet Union-era decorations and propaganda. The back room even looks like you\u2019re in a submarine! It\u2019s a great spot to have a few drinks and snap some cool photos before heading out to dance.\r\n<h2><strong>Practicalities<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nWhile a trip to South America can seem like such a difficult task to pull off, visiting Cartagena is actually quite easy. There are direct flights here from Fort Lauderdale, Miami, Atlanta, and New York in the US, as well as some seasonal flights from a few Canadian cities.\r\n\r\nFor continuing your South America journey, there are super cheap flights from here to other cities in Colombia such as Bogota and Medellin. As far as visas go, citizens from 95 different countries are allowed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.colombia.travel\/en\/practical-information\/visa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">90 days visa-free in Colombia<\/a> on arrival.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4103\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"700\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4103 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Cartagena-fort.jpg\" alt=\"The view from Cartagena city walls\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" \/> The fort as viewed from the city wall.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWith its historical walled city, beautiful beaches, delicious cuisine, and legendary nightlife, Cartagena makes an excellent choice for a vacation. It\u2019s also a great way to get your feet wet when traveling in South America, as it\u2019s got a very developed tourism industry and is quite safe. A few days of exploring the Old Town, lounging on the beach, and wining, dining, and dancing the night away here is the perfect warm-up for all the epic adventures this continent has to offer.\r\n<h3><strong>About the author<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nBio: Sasha is an English teacher, videographer, and blogger from the suburbs of Detroit.

Located just 6 km from the small town of Laguardia, it comes highly recommended as a stop on any trip through this region of Spain.\r\n\r\nWith a tour booked at 10:30 am (I love getting the day started the right way!), we decided to spend a night in a hotel nearby. The vineyard actually has an onsite luxury hotel, however, as always luxury comes as a price (rooms start at \u20ac300). If like us, you are looking for something a little less pricey, then there are plenty of cheaper options in the regional capital, Logro\u00f1o, but we opted for the nearby picturesque small town of Laguardia.\r\n\r\nWe were celebrating a special occasion (I won't bore you with the details) but as a result, I decided to splash out a little more than I usually would and stayed at the boutique hotel <a href=\"http:\/\/hotelcollado.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\">Castillo El Collado<\/a> (\u20ac119). The building dates from the 19th century and is constructed on the site of a 12th-century fort complete with an imposing tower as a symbolic nod to the past. As soon as we walked in it felt as if we had stepped back in history, the dark wooden staircase, stone walls, and impressive artworks; welcoming, yet slightly intimidating. However, as we entered our room, all that faded away. Each of the ten rooms is individually decorated; ours felt warm and romantic with wooden paneling on the walls, a fireplace, bed big enough for a whole family and a luxurious Romanesque bathroom with a tub big enough to sink the Titanic (though not the iceberg). Oh, I haven\u2019t mentioned the complimentary bottle of wine that all guests also receive!\r\n\r\nAfter a glass of red, we set out to discover more. We didn\u2019t have to go very far; the hotel allows guests to ascend to the top of the tower. The wooden staircase creaked beneath our feet as we circled our way to the top of the tower. Old bottles of wine are displayed on the wall as a reminder of where you were . . . in case you\u2019d forgotten that you were in the centre of one of Spain\u2019s most famous wine regions.\u00a0 As we emerged onto the roof of the tower we were greeted by the sight of the Obarenes-Sierra de Cantabria mountains running along the horizon to the north, their exposed rock faces glimmering in the sunlight as if capped in snow. In every other direction were expanses of vineyards, flowing to the horizon as far as the eye can see. When I travel places I always love to find the highest viewpoint and take it all in so this was a bonus. However, as usual, something happens to dent the moment, this time, it was my inability to remember to charge any of my camera devices leaving me unable to capture the view \u2013 this one will have to be left as a memory.\r\n\r\nAs we headed away from the hotel, we took a walk in the surrounding gardens (free to access) and onto the thin streets enclosed by towering facades. Although all the shops were closed by the time we arrived, there were many bars open serving pinchos and tapas, of course, accompanied by the local wine at excellent prices \u2013 70 cents for a glass in some places!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/La_Guardia,_Spain\" target=\"_blank\">Laguardia is a charming<\/a>, peaceful place that is ideal for exploring the region and we loved it, however, if you're after a little more life in the evenings, Logro\u00f1o would be a better place to stay. As for the hotel itself, I wholeheartedly recommend it as a place to stay, I didn\u2019t see any other rooms, but ours was amazing, and the staff were fantastic.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1064 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_20161004_113435740.jpg\" alt=\"Marques de Riscal vineyard\" width=\"448\" height=\"252\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe next morning we headed to the vineyard in the small village of Elciego. When looking for vineyards to visit I generally try to do tours of smaller producers as I feel they offer a more personal experience. You can discover some real gems while supporting local small businesses. However, as in a previous period of my life, when I worked in hotels and restaurants, we used to stock the Rioja Reserva (and was one of my faves) I thought a chance to visit the vineyard was too good to pass up.\r\n<h2>Finding the Vineyard<\/h2>\r\nIt took less than 10 minutes to get there, even after navigating a tricky roundabout where a signpost pointed us in completely the wrong direction. It\u2019s hard to miss the vineyard; the horizon is dominated by two features, the village\u2019s dual-towered church, the Parroquia San Andr\u00e9s Ap\u00f3stol and the contrastingly modern titanium roof of the new hotel at the Marques De Riscal Bodegas. As with many modern designs, I\u2019m sure the striking style has attracted much praise, and as many insults, personally I love it. Designed by Frank Gehry, the same architect that created <a href=\"https:\/\/www.guggenheim-bilbao.es\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bilbao's Guggenheim Museum<\/a>, the roof reflects the sun with a mixture of pink, gold and silver hues. We were later to find out the reason for this.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1057\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"448\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1057 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_20161004_104919060_HDR.jpg\" alt=\"Stunning architecture of the Marques de Riscal hotel\" width=\"448\" height=\"226\" \/> The titanium roof of the Marques de Riscal hotel[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWe parked the car and headed straight to the visitor centre to check in for our tour (advanced booking is highly recommended). The shop sells a myriad of local arts and crafts as well as all of their wine and a rather nice caf\u00e9 alongside serving local tapas and a good selection of their wines by the glass. It offers an opportunity to try some of the higher end ones without having to splash out on a whole bottle.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1067\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"417\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1067\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_20161004_105431342_HDR-min.jpg\" alt=\"Looking back from the vineyard\" width=\"417\" height=\"336\" \/> Looking back from the vineyard[\/caption]\r\n<h2>Marques De Riscal Vineyard Tour<\/h2>\r\nThe tour itself was very enjoyable. I have been on many, and this definitely ranks alongside the best if you have a genuine interest in wine. It began with a short video detailing the history of the brand before our guide led us to a vineyard with fantastic views of the architecture and we were even invited to try some of the Cabernet Sauvignon grapes straight from the vine. They were surprisingly sweet!\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1060\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"448\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1060 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_20161004_105454200_HDR.jpg\" alt=\"Marques de Riscal vineyard\" width=\"448\" height=\"270\" \/> Cabernet Sauvignon grapes grow and we were invited to try the. ... which we did![\/caption]\r\n\r\nWe were lucky as at the time of our visit (October) the harvest was in full flow and the vineyard thriving with life. The guide explained the process of making the wine before taking us into the cellars and finally the bottling room.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1059\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1059 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Grapes.jpg\" alt=\"Marques de Riscal wine production\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" \/> Wine making in full flow[\/caption]\r\n\r\nTo see the production on such a scale is somewhat mind-numbing. I found the machine that puts the wire mesh around the bottles particular fascinating. Now just a part of tradition - and an annoyance to bar staff everywhere when trying to remove it in a hurry \u2013 the mesh was an antifraud device. The story goes that as their wine was one of the better ones, bars would sometimes simply refill the Marques De Riscal bottles with cheap plonk and sell it again. The mesh was there as a customer guarantee, so they know they are getting the real product. What stood out most from that room was the noise. In my old industry whenever I heard bottles clunking together like that it sent a shiver down the spine as I waited for the inevitable follow-up smashing of glass. Here it never comes, but the noise still puts me on edge!\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1062\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"252\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1062 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_20161004_115522504.jpg\" alt=\"Marques de Riscal vineyard\" width=\"252\" height=\"448\" \/> Bottles whizz aroung the labeling machine[\/caption]\r\n<h2>The bottle room<\/h2>\r\nBefore we headed for the bit everyone was there for (the tasting) we had one last highlight \u2013 the bottle room. It is in this cellar that the vineyard has kept bottles of every vintage dating back to the very first run in 1863. They keep up to 3000 bottles depending on how good they feel the vintage was in that year. When VIP\u2019s visit the vineyard, they will still open a bottle for them. For example, when celebrating the opening of the hotel with Mr. Gehry, they were able to enjoy a bottle of 1928 vintage with him \u2013 the year of his birth. Sadly I didn\u2019t make the list.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1061\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"448\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1061 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_20161004_114421668.jpg\" alt=\"Bottle cellar at Marques de Riscal vineyard\" width=\"448\" height=\"238\" \/> The stunning cellar ... so much wine![\/caption]\r\n\r\nAs we concluded the tour, we headed to a room set up for tasting enjoying one white and one red with a group discussion encouraged. As usual with these tours that gather up groups of strangers, most people seemed reserved and wouldn\u2019t speak out loud for fear of embarrassing themselves . . . Myself included. As the final sip of the 2012 Reserva slid down my throat, that was the end of the tour, and we re-entered the visitor centre as the next group was heading out to start their journey.\r\n<h2>After the tour<\/h2>\r\nWe did stay for a bit longer after the tour.

Show it some love and pin it on Pintrest[\/caption]\r\n\r\nYou can hike to Devil's Pool on the Zambian side of the Victoria Falls. The nearest town in Zambia is Livingstone, although you could also stay in the town of Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe. Just bear in mind you'll need to cross the border and pay for a one day visa to enjoy the hike to the pool.\r\n\r\nI was staying in Livingstone and had arrived a few days earlier having caught the bus from Lusaka. The Lusaka bus station is quite a metal place (as all seem to be in Africa) but it was quite straightforward to book a bus and find out where to go, they are all clearly numbered.\r\n\r\nI had booked to stay at the <a href=\"https:\/\/backpackzambia.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jollyboys Backpackers<\/a>. I had been recommended it by some other travellers I met earlier in my trip and I wasn\u2019t disappointed.\r\n\r\nThere is a nice swimming pool (very well received after the 28-hour slog of an overland journey), a bar, restaurant and garden with mango trees. I didn't think I was ever going to leave this little oasis!\r\n<h2 id=\"Livingstone\">Welcome to Livingstone town<\/h2>\r\nLivingstone is a great base for a visit to the Devil's Pool. As you\u2019d expect from a place as close to the Victoria Falls, it is a little bit touristy, but it still holds on to its authentic small-town vibe. It felt a little more affluent than the other towns I had visited, but again, that\u2019s probably due to the tourism.\r\n\r\nMy first day here was just strolling around. I visited the craft market which is constant harassment \u2013 the traders tell you how poor they are and how they need you to buy something so they can afford the bus home.\r\n\r\nJust be ready for it as they are good and it really pulls at your heartstrings, making you feel really guilty if you don\u2019t buy something from them. I ended up caving in and buying a carved giraffe statue that was made by a local trader.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2514\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2514\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Jollyboys-Tropical-Garden.jpg\" alt=\"Places to stay in Zambia, Jollyboys Hostel, Livingstone\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/> The tropical Garden in Jollyboys Backpackers[\/caption]\r\n<h2>Are they really unique?<\/h2>\r\nWell, he told me he made it but it looks suspiciously similar to the ones on all the other stalls, just with a different name carved on the bottom.\r\nIt\u2019s almost like they get the same stock and just carve their own name on it, but they wouldn\u2019t do that, would they?\r\n\r\nLittle did I realise that by doing this I now had a bag, a signal to others that I had money to spend and the calling definitely stepped up a notch.\r\n\r\nIf you can deal with it and are in a patient mood the craft market is worth a visit; if you are having a bad day I\u2019d stay away. I find some days I will be really patient and handle them with ease but other days I get angry with them. It\u2019s difficult emotionally as I know they are only trying to make a living.\r\n<h2>Lots of other things to do in Livingstone<\/h2>\r\nI was in Livingstone for a total of five days, before I made the trip to Devil\u2019s Pool. I was worried I\u2019d be bored but this wasn\u2019t the case. Between the activities organised by the hostel, including a football game with kids in a local orphanage, visiting lions and cheetahs, lounging by the pool, and going to all the local sites, the time flew by.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2519\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2519\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Playing-football-at-the-orphanage.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting an orphanage in Zambia\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/> Playing football with the locals.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2520\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"wp-image-2520 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Playing-football-with-the-local-kids.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting an orphanage in Livingstone\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/> They weren't that interested in the football![\/caption]\r\n<h2>Want to know more about my African adventure?<\/h2>\r\n<strong>Quick plug<\/strong> \u2013 if you want to know more about this area in depth, this post is based on a chapter from my book: How to clean your underwear in Africa; Diary of an unskilled traveller.

Their answer; a booked excursion and balls of steel!\r\n<h2 id=\"wherewhen\">Which country offers the best views of Victoria Falls?<\/h2>\r\nI spent that day visiting the park that surrounds the falls; they were beautiful but it was difficult to get a good view from the Zambian side. It\u2019s kind of like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/niagara-falls-ponchos-hornblowing\/\">visiting Niagara Falls<\/a>, to see the best views you have to go to the Canadian side . . . same with the Victoria Falls; you need to go to the Zimbabwean side.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to cross the border for a day to see the Victoria Falls from both sides, but you will have to pay for an entry visa, something in the region of $50.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2526\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2526\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Where-Livingstone-first-saw-the-falls.jpg\" alt=\"Which side is better to see the Victoria Falls?\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/> The view from the Zambian side and the spot Livingstone first set eyes on Victoria Falls[\/caption]\r\n<h2>Mixed Feelings about the best time to visit Victoria Falls<\/h2>\r\nIn truth, I was a little disappointed as I was there in the dry season so the falls weren\u2019t in full flow, but I did find out you can\u2019t visit the Devil\u2019s Pool when it is, as it\u2019s too dangerous, so I got over my disappointment pretty quickly.\r\n\r\nIf you just want to see the falls, you'd have to go at the end of the wet season to see it in all its glory. But, if you want to visit Devil's Pool? Then you may have to think a bit harder. Rainy season is from November to April. I was visiting at the end of October, possibly the driest possible time!\r\n\r\nWhile wandering around the park surrounding the falls there are plenty of nods to David Livingstone, considered the first European to see the falls and naming them after his Queen at the time, Queen Victoria.\r\n<h2>Victoria Falls original name<\/h2>\r\nWhat\u2019s nice is that more and more the original name of the Victoria Falls, Mosi-oa-Tunya\u2014\"The Smoke That Thunders\"\u2014 is coming back into use.\r\n<h2 id=\"howto\">Heading to Devil's Pool<\/h2>\r\nIt was an early start to get to Devil\u2019s Pool; I had met another guy at the hostel who was going to take the jump with me. We agreed that should the worst happen to one of us, we would deliver a message to our families personally that he died in a stupid way but it was worth it.\r\n<h2>Get a bus with the locals<\/h2>\r\nTo save money we got the local mini bus to the falls, which is always an adventure. There often isn\u2019t a time it leaves. They wait until the bus is full, let a few more people on, chuck in a few chickens for fun and then go.\r\n\r\nBy this point, I was very used to this method of transport and how it all works. I think the reason African people are so chatty is they pack everyone on so tightly, it feels more uncomfortable if you don\u2019t spark up a conversation.\r\n\r\nI got chatting to a chap in a Denver Bronco's shirt. Turns out he runs one of the local stalls selling tourist souvenirs at the entrance to the Victoria Falls.\r\nWhen we arrived we had a quick look at Bronco's man\u2019s stall out of courtesy and then met up with our Devil\u2019s Pool group; there were six of us.\r\nThe meeting point is at the main entrance and after a worryingly brief safety chat, we were on our way.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2518\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"wp-image-2518 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Meeting-the-guide.jpg\" alt=\"Booking a tour guide and how to get to Devil's Pool\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/> Our guide for the hike[\/caption]\r\n<h2 id=\"thehike\">How hard is it to hike to Devil's Pool?<\/h2>\r\nThe hike over to the falls was pretty epic. It starts on the normal paths but then you veer off toward the river.\r\n\r\nLots of other tourists who were on day trips were watching our little posse inquisitively as we approached the river. This turned quickly into a mixture of concern and confusion, their faces saying \u2018can they do that? They\u2019ll surely die\u2019.\r\n\r\nThe hike starts off with a bit of rock hopping. Fortunately, the African sun had ensured they were dry and grippy as about seven metres to our left was a fall to certain oblivion. But it wasn\u2019t long before we reached our first tricky bit.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2521\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"wp-image-2521 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Rock-hopping.jpg\" alt=\"This was the easy bit of the hike to Devil's Pool\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/> Starting off easy[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThere is a local power station which syphons off a lot of the water from this area of the river; however, when we were passing our guide explained that they were cleaning the turbine so there was more water than usual.\r\nThe result? We had to cross about a 30m section of concrete, about the width of a balance beam, with a couple of inches of water rushing over our ankles.\r\n\r\nThe guide told us to all hold hands and inch across. He said it was for safety, but I\u2019m not sure if it was more a case of if one goes, they all go, leave no witnesses to his crazy sense of a safe crossing point.\r\n\r\nI don't think I have concentrated so hard on anything in my life.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2513\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"wp-image-2513 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Everyone-focussing.jpg\" alt=\"Hiking to the Devil's Pool\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/> Pure concentration[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWe all managed to pass safely and about another 30 mins of rock hopping, wading and jumping all within a few metres of death we made it to the pool.\r\n\r\nThe views on the way were spectacular. At one point we found ourselves standing right on the edge with the spray from the falls creating rainbows that felt so close I could almost reach out and grab them.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2524\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2524\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Views-from-the-hike.jpg\" alt=\"Standing atop Victoria Falls\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/> The views on the way were magnificent[\/caption]\r\n<h2 id=\"jumpingin\">Arriving at the edge of the falls<\/h2>\r\nThe actual pool is about three metres deep, right on the cusp of the falls, with a natural wall to stop you from getting swept over the 100-metre drop.\r\n\r\nFirst in was our guide, he pulled off a stunning somersault with distinction. Once he was in, I assume to catch us if we jumped too far, it was our turn.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2522\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"wp-image-2522 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Sat-at-the-edge-of-the-falls.jpg\" alt=\"Getting close to the edge of Victoria Falls\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/> Sat at the edge of the falls during a quick 2-minute break.[\/caption]\r\n<h2>One after another we held our breath and jumped in.<\/h2>\r\nAs my turn approached, I couldn\u2019t get the story I had read out of my head about an accident at Devil's Pool where a guide died after being swept over. To be fair, given the reckless abandon our guide was showing by standing up on the edge I wasn\u2019t surprised.\r\n\r\nI cleared my mind of all thoughts and jumped. I thought the somersault would have been too easy so instead, I opted for a cannonball and boom, I was in.\r\n\r\nThe feeling was a mixture of complete exhilaration and fear, I could only equate it to a skydive I did in The Florida Keys a few years ago.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2515\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2515\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Jumping-into-Devils-Pool.jpg\" alt=\"Jumping into Devil's Pool\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/> Here comes the thunder![\/caption]\r\n\r\nI surfaced and, much to my relief, I was still at the top of the falls and so was the rest of the group. The mini tsunami my entrance had caused didn\u2019t sweep everyone off the edge as I feared it may.\r\n\r\nSuddenly it was all worth it. The fear, the trepidation, the worries all washed over the falls and the exhilaration kicked in. I was in the Devil\u2019s Pool. I had been looking forward to this moment from the second I began planning my trip and it did not disappoint.\r\n\r\nTo be sat in a pool, staring down from the top of one of the biggest waterfalls in the world was a true bucket list moment.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2527\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2527\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Zimbabwe-behind.jpg\" alt=\"Going to Devil's Pool Zambia\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/> I can't even remember who was taking these photos.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2517\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-2517\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Looking-over-the-edge-of-the-falls.jpg\" alt=\"Looking over the edge of Victoria Falls\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/> Looking over the edge[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn total we were in the pool for about 10 minutes, posing for pictures and being bitten by very annoying little fish before it was time to head back.\r\nAs we returned, the water had been re-diverted to the power station again so most a lot of the hike was now dry. It only took 20 minutes to get back before continuing on to the hostel to enjoy a well-deserved celebratory beer.\r\n\r\nThe Devil\u2019s Pool is an amazing trip that I would highly recommend to anyone and everyone. Even if you just do the hike and not the jump it is well worth it.\r\n\r\nIf you get to Victoria Falls early in the morning, you should be able to book the trip and do it on the same day, although I would always recommend visiting or calling ahead of time to make sure that the trips are happening and that they have space. Your hostel\/hotel should be able to help you with this.\r\n\r\nCheck it out, accommodation in Livingstone: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.booking.com\/searchresults.html?city=-2290790&amp;aid=1286843&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Places to stay in Livingstone<\/a>\r\n<h2 id=\"allyouneed\">Seven top tips for visiting Devils Pool:<\/h2>\r\n1 - Don't wear flip-flops, the hike the Devil's Pool isn't really difficult but there are a number of long steps\/jumps between rocks so best wear something sturdy on your feet.\r\n\r\n2 - Make sure your footwear is waterproof, it will probably get wet.\r\n\r\n3 - Book your tour unless you want to pay the entry fee to get into Victoria Falls park twice.\r\n\r\n4 - Take a camera, you will want to look at the pictures over and over again.\r\n\r\n5 - The hike to Devil's Pool is actually quite straight forward, I'd almost say easy, so don't worry too \u00a0much.\r\n\r\n6 - You have to book a tour to Devil's Pool, you are not allowed to hike there on your own.\r\n\r\n7 - DO IT!\r\n\r\nSo - would you like to jump with The Devil?

Probably not! Now, I've grown up spending lots of time at the seaside, but last year when I went to North Norfolk, UK, I just fell in love with Horsey Beach. It is completely spotless, surrounded by dunes to clamber over and it feels like it stretches for miles. It honestly felt like I had stepped onto a beach somewhere exotic. And to put the cherry on the cake, during the winter months Horsey beach is home to a colony of Grey Seals! You can see them swimming along the water's edge and basking in the sun on the shore. There are no barriers or restrictions here; it has been left completely spotless and you can throw yourself into the natural beauty of it all. It\u2019s a proper gem and a must-see beach for a trip to the UK!<\/span>\r\n\r\nKatie Featherstone, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.featherytravels.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Feathery Travels<\/a>, gets lost in the drama of the Scottish Islands. Her best beach is in Port nan Gallan, The Oa, Isle of Islay, Scotland:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/3.-Scotland-2.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting Port nan Gallan, The Oa, Isle of Islay\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A strange growth of land, almost detached from the rest of the island in both landscape and geography, the Oa descends a sharp hundred meters into the sea. The cliffs are so dramatic it looks like the setting for an unwritten adventure, fantasy novel. With these bizarre rock formations, a crashing waterfall and a good fifty wild goats, I return to Port nan Gallan every time I visit my family on the Isle of Islay. Often overlooked in favour of mountains and castles, Scotland's coastline is sprinkled with treasures like these, but the real beauty is that you'll probably have them to yourself.<\/span>\r\n<h2>Top European Beaches<\/h2>\r\n<span id=\"Europe\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So who would have thought there would be three UK beaches in the list?

Praia Grade de Pera stretches between Ribeira de Alcantarilha and Lagoa dos Salgados, a natural reserve featuring a lake and several rare species of water birds. Although this beach offers all modern amenities such as hotels, beach bars and restaurants, you'll have the pleasure to find a few secluded and private spots. On Praia Grande, you can have the best of both worlds, wildlife and modern comfort. Camping in your own RV is also possible. The nearest bigger town is Albufeira. You can reach this area by flying to Faro, Portugal, and by renting a car or by using the public transport.<\/span>\r\n\r\nToccara &amp; Sam, <a href=\"http:\/\/forgetsomeday.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http:\/\/forgetsomeday.com<\/a>, had quite an adventure to reach the crystal clear waters of Grandovac Beach on the island of Vis in Croatia:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1728\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/5.-Vis-37.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting Vis, Croatia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grandovac Beach on the island of Vis in Croatia may not be the easiest beach to reach, but the effort to get there is certainly worth it! To reach the island of Vis from Split, hop on the public ferry for the 2h20m journey for a low cost of less than $10 USD. We personally recommend you spend a few days on the island to make your journey worthwhile! To get to Grandovac Beach from the harbour town of Vis, you have two options \u2013take a taxi or walk! (Note, the road to get to the beach is a little treacherous and not all taxis will go there. Also, for this reason, rented scooters are not permitted on this road.) For the sake of ease (and your wallet), we recommend walking. It\u2019ll take about 20 minutes and you\u2019ll pass through the lovely village of Kut along the way. You\u2019ll forget all about whatever effort it took you to get there the instant you arrive at Grandovac Beach. Even during the summer, this beach remains uncrowded and the crystal clear water of the Adriatic will take your breath away. Swim, snorkel, or simply relax as you take in one of Croatia\u2019s most gorgeous beaches!<\/span>\r\n\r\nSilvia Galvan, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.findingupendi.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.findingupendi.com<\/a>, finds year round blue sky in Playa de Sotavento on Fuerteventura, one of the Canary Islands:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1729\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/6.-Canary.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting Playa de Sotavento on Fuerteventura, one of the Canary Islands\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The island of Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands is known for having some of the best beaches in Spain, and although it is not easy to pick one, I'd have to go with Playa de Sotavento. This beach covers most of the southern coast of the island, boasting of nearly 10 kilometres of clean white sand and clear blue waters. Given the permanent state of summer that the island seems to be living under, you will also be guaranteed a clear blue sky about 350 days a year. The beach is especially popular among windsurfers and kitesurfers, and it actually plays host to the World Windsurf Championships every year during the months of July - August. No matter the time of the year, you can always count on a peaceful blue overdose with some kites splashed over it at this beach.<\/span>\r\n\r\nPascal, <a href=\"http:\/\/Truevoyagers.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Truevoyagers.com<\/a>, finds some divine views while visiting Monastiriou beach in Amorgos, Greece:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1730\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/7.-Greece.jpg\" alt=\"visiting Monastiriou beach in Amorgos, Greece\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amorgos is a Greek island in the Cyclades with white houses, crystal clear waters and a peaceful atmosphere. During your visit to the island, you shouldn\u2019t miss the monastery of Panagia Hozoviotissa and its gorgeous beach. Monastiriou (Monastery) beach is a secluded bay which is mostly reachable by boat as the path that leads to the beach is extremely steep. The beach itself boasts the most brilliant blue waters humans could have laid eyes upon. It\u2019s no wonder that this area (which includes the famous Agia Anna beach as well) has been the perfect scene for Luc Besson's cult movie \u201cThe Big Blue\u201d. The monastery right above is built into the face of a cliff, thus you will need to climb 1000 steps to get to the top, but once you arrive, you will be rewarded with one of the most spectacular views you have ever seen, the endless blue of the Aegean Sea.<\/span>\r\n\r\nGiulia, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blocal-travel.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http:\/\/www.blocal-travel.com<\/a>, couldn\u2019t single out one beach but instead, recommends the whole of Albania:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1731\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/8.-Albania.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting Albanian beaches\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Albania is one of Europe\u2019s best-kept secrets, especially when it comes to unspoilt beaches. The country stretches along the Mediterranean Sea, with a few big harbours in the north and several small villages in the south. My favourite beaches are in the area surrounding the picturesque village of Himare, as far as the more touristic area of Sarande, where you also find an UNESCO-listed archaeological site (Butrint). Dotted with abandoned bunkers from the Enver Hoxha era, the Albanian Riviera is rough and wild. Its beaches are sometimes secluded (such as in Gjipe, where you will find massive red cliffs), sometimes vast and quite sandy (such as in Borsh). Often, they are towered by ancient villages made up of stone houses, which are silent and suspended in time, if it weren\u2019t for the herds of either goats or cows wandering around them.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read more about Albania\u2019s beaches here: \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.blocal-travel.com\/balkans\/albania\/albanian-riviera-html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http:\/\/www.blocal-travel.com\/balkans\/albania\/albanian-riviera-html<\/a><\/span>\r\n<h2>Beaches in the Philippines<\/h2>\r\n<span id=\"Philippines\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OK, I think it\u2019s time for a special mention.

This tropical paradise, located in the Philippines, is famous for its white powdery sand and azure water. The most well-known beach in Boracay is White Beach, and this is the centre of tourist activities. White Beach is perfect for party-goers and beach lovers. It has night bars and pub crawls, as well as a wide range of restaurant options. It also offers numerous activities that can fill up weeks of a schedule, such as island hopping, helmet diving, parasailing, mermaid swimming and a whole lot more. For beach bums who prefer a little more solitude, Boracay doesn\u2019t come up short. There are lesser-known, quieter locations such as Puka Beach, which are great for relaxation and idyllic activities such as sunset viewing.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read their full blog about Boracay here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.taraletsanywhere.com\/surprise-we-actually-like-boracay\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.taraletsanywhere.com\/surprise-we-actually-like-boracay<\/a><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Margherita Ragg, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thecrowdedplanet.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http:\/\/www.thecrowdedplanet.com<\/a>, recommends Solangon beach:<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1733\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/10.-Solangon.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting Solangon beach, Philippines\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I've seen many nice beaches in my life, especially in the Philippines, a country that in my opinion is home to some of the most beautiful seascapes in the world! Solangon beach on Siquijor may not be the most photogenic beach in the country, but it's definitely my favourite. Why? Actually, there are two reasons. Because it's the first Filipino beach we visited, we spent 5 wonderful days chilling in a local resort, doing nothing except swimming, relaxing, drinking fresh juice and eating fresh fish! The second reason is because of its wonderful sunsets. Every day nature put on a different show for us, and they're still the best sunsets I've ever seen!<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christine Vigonte<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1734\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/11.-Caramoan.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting Caramoan beach in the Philippines\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caramoan is a small town in the Philippines endowed with untapped natural resources. It is a land of many caves, rivers, lakes, lagoon (found through hiking within the island) and a sea of crystal clear waters decorated by many beautiful unexplored islands. In the recent years, it was featured in the local and foreign programs, one of which is the TV show \u201cSurvivor\u201d, which eventually gained tourism popularity. Local and foreign travellers started to explore and love the beaches of the town. Apart from the beauty of nature, visitors are captivated by the warmth and family-like culture of the locals.

Part of El Nido\u2019s charm is its remoteness but there are plenty of amazing activities to be had too. \u00a0You can stay on land and rent a motorbike to a secluded beach or waterfall. \u00a0Jump on a paddleboard or go island hopping and kayak in gorgeous aquamarine lagoons! \u00a0El Nido has it all and should definitely be on your bucket list! <\/span>\r\n<h2>Best beaches in Australia<\/h2>\r\n<span id=\"Australia\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming a close second and another country that is synonymous with beach life is, of course, Australia. Blessed with a little over 16,000 miles of coastline, there are sure to be some stunning Australian beaches. Here are some of our blogger's suggestions:<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carla &amp; Jarratt, <a href=\"http:\/\/Eathiketravel.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eathiketravel.com<\/a>, recommend the wilderness of Wineglass Bay in Freycinet National Park, Tasmania:<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1736\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/13.-WIneglass-Bay.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting Wineglass Bay, Tasmania, Australia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With translucent turquoise waters lapping against the fine white sand of the crescent shaped beach, it\u2019s no surprise that Wineglass Bay in Tasmania is regarded as one of the finest beaches in the world. Located in Freycinet National Park and with the Hazards mountains as the backdrop, this picturesque beach truly is in the wilderness. Accessible only on foot or by boat, you\u2019re sure to find a moment to have the beach to yourself if you get started early enough.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On foot, the Wineglass Bay lookout can be reached by a 1.5-hour return climb (uphill!) and this is where most visitors will finish, content to marvel at the spectacular view. Allow another hour (return) to visit the beach itself and wade in the crystal-clear ocean. Quite often your only swimming companions will be a pod of dolphins!<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Del, <a href=\"https:\/\/delabroad.blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/delabroad.blog<\/a>, explores Caloundra, Queensland, Australia:<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1737\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/14.-Caloundra.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting Caloundra beach Australia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caloundra is my favourite beach to escape and travel to in the sunny state of Queensland and is only about a short 2-hour drive north of Brisbane, Australia. Bulcock beach in Caloundra, especially along the esplanade is a very popular beachside area with both the locals and tourists\u2019 alike. Not only does it offer superb views but also a great selection of dining options, after a busy day of sun, sand and surf. It has the \u201cCoastal Pathway\u201d which is a beautiful boardwalk that you can take for a few kilometres along to Kings Beach, Shelly Beach and Moffat Beach and all the way up to Dicky Beach. You will experience stunning beach views throughout and a wonderful sense of wellbeing, that only being by the sea can give you.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rain Campanilla, <a href=\"http:\/\/wordsandwanderlust.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http:\/\/wordsandwanderlust.com<\/a>, loves Soldiers Beach in Norah Head, New South Wales:<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1738\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/15.-15.-Soldiers-Beach-2.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting Soldiers Beach in New South Wales, Australia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soldiers Beach in Norah Head, NSW is my ultimate favourite amongst the innumerable beaches along the east coast of Australia. It boasts of a long strip of white sand amongst rocky platforms and low bluffs. It is often eclipsed by the more popular Norah Head Lighthouse and The Entrance Pelican Feeding Park and is mostly known only to locals. It is a delight for more morning walkers, swimmers and surfers. The area also has a coffee shop where one can enjoy a cuppa before a picturesque vista. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maia Pesayco, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.passportandpostcards.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.passportandpostcards.com<\/a>, takes us back to the Gold Coast and Currumbin Beach:<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1739\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/16.-Currumbin.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting Currumbin Beach in Australia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An up and coming beachfront community, Currumbin Beach is very different from most Gold Coast seaside suburbs. Here, homes are built on the hillside, overlooking the beach or by the Pacific Parade enveloping the hillside. The Currumbin Creek and Alley serve not only as an entryway to the ocean but also provide a protected and patrolled haven for different kids of active water sports such as kayaking and stand-up paddle boarding. Every September, Currumbin Beach also plays hosts to 'The Swell Sculpture Festival' where sculptures are placed along the Pacific Parade and directly on the beach to observe, touch, feel, and take photos of. Some artists even allow for kids to play with their creations, making the wonderful event perfect for the whole family. With a number of Lookouts to view the gorgeous beach and watch some surfers ride that perfect wave, modern caf\u00e9s sharing the beachfront vistas and the famous Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary just metres away, you'll easily find yourself spending a whole day here! <\/span>\r\n<h2>Stunning beaches in The Caribbean<\/h2>\r\n<span id=\"Caribbean\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where next?

Not everybody expects to sit at the beach and have aeroplanes whiz by only 100 feet above your head. Yet that is exactly what Maho Beach on the Caribbean island of St. Maarten is. Dubbed one of the most dangerous beaches in the world, it is a top attraction for thrill-seekers and those who want to relax and watch aeroplanes. Some people choose to even stand directly behind the planes as they take off, while others prefer to swim in the crystal clear waters and admire the planes as they land just overhead. This extraordinary destination certainly earns Maho Beach the title of one of the top beaches in the world.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jessica Festa, <a href=\"http:\/\/jessieonajourney.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http:\/\/jessieonajourney.com<\/a>, gets a boat at Exuma Caves, Bahamas:<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1741\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/18.-SwimmingPigs.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting the swimming pigs in the Bahamas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a quirky beach experience, head to the lesser-known Exuma Cays in the Bahamas and take a boat out to Big Major Spot Cay.

My favourite part about Muuido is the sunset. \u00a0It\u2019s by far the best sunset I\u2019ve ever seen in Korea and pretty close to #1 in all of Asia. \u00a0Maybe we just got lucky but this picture doesn\u2019t need me to elaborate on how stunning the orange and red hues are on Muuido Island!<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tracy Chong, <a href=\"http:\/\/peekholidays.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http:\/\/peekholidays.com<\/a>, loves Wayag island in Indonesia, check it out and you\u2019ll soon see why:<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1745\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/22.-Indonesia.jpg\" alt=\"visiting the stunning Wayag island in Indonesia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raja Ampat in West Papua is claimed as the heaven for the divers due to the richness of its marine life. As shown in the photo is part of Wayag island, the icon of Raja Ampat. To get this view, there is a little bit climbing involved; to the top of the karst hill which has quite harsh and sharp surface. But as long as you watch your step, getting to the top of the hill to enjoy the view, is not an issue at all. Wayag is about 2-3 hours away from Waisai, the capital of Raja Ampat, by speed boat. Besides enjoying the view, you can also enjoy snorkeling or just casually swimming around the island.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wendy, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldwidewendy.be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.worldwidewendy.be<\/a>, Dreams of being shipwrecked in the Maldives:<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1746\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/23.-Maldives.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting Maldives as one of the best beaches in the world\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did you ever dream of experiencing the Robinson Crusoe feeling? In that case, the Islands of the Maldives have to be your next destination. Numerous atolls are floating just above the surface of the Indian Ocean. Everywhere you look, you see landscapes postcard-worthy. \u00a0White sandy beaches, abundant palm trees and crystal clear water are everywhere. Bandos is the biggest and most popular island and Olhuveli and Kuda Huraa are the most exclusive. I have been to many places but the Maldives beaches are unbeatable. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rishabh Shah, <a href=\"http:\/\/gypsycouple.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http:\/\/gypsycouple.com<\/a>, loves the variety that Goa, India, has to offer:<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1747\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/24.-Football-on-the-beach-Only-in-Goa.jpg\" alt=\"Playing Football on the beach in Goa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goa is an enigma and has gone through multiple personality changes over the past few decades. From being a hippie hub in the 70's-80's to being a party hotspot in the 90's-00s to its present avatar of a lost child finding its way back. However one thing about it remains constant, it\u2019s wonderful array of beaches remain one of the best in the world. One of the few destinations we've visited which has rocky beaches, black beaches, muddy beaches and white sand beaches within its periphery and all of them world class beaches to boot. Some of them perfect for long romantic walks, others for getting a tan, yet others for a spell of self-introspection, some beaches a haven for partygoers and some maybe to join locals for a game of football. To cap it up, Goa in monsoons is a whole new destination in itself. A beach for everyone and all seasons making it our top beach destination. <\/span>\r\n<h2>Beaches in Oceania<\/h2>\r\n<span id=\"Oceania\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How a few more beaches in Oceania?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kay &amp; Gelo, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jointhetravellingpair.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.jointhetravellingpair.com<\/a>, tell tales of Whale Bay on the Tutukaka Coast, New Zealand:<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1748\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/25.-Whale-Bay.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting Whale Bay in New Zealand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whale Bay Beach is tucked in the Northeast coast of New Zealand's North Island. It is quite a small and secluded spot and we reckon it's the best beaches in the world. Why do you ask? Well, let's start with some of the most common and essential attributes that make up a good beach. Whale Bay Beach has fine white sand and crystal clear turquoise waters, it is also in a sheltered bay so the water is calm and perfect for snorkelling or a relaxing swim. Now for most folks, such traits would be more than enough for a great swimming spot but this little gem goes way beyond that. It is surrounded by lush greenery and has no direct road access, you'll actually have to walk a \u00a0good 15 minutes through native bush to get to the actual beach. Consequently, the beach tends to be more tranquil compared to more popular shores, even during summer. Furthermore, it is relatively untouched by development and the only infrastructure present is a single toilet facility. The sheltered bay is home to many of the native marine species in New Zealand which makes it an incredible snorkelling location. Dolphins and the occasional orca whales also frequent the place to hunt small fish and stingray. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Juliette Siversten, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.snorkelstosnow.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">www.snorkelstosnow.com<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, marches with sergeant fish in Fiji:<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1749\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/26.-Fiji.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting the islands of Fiji\" width=\"1000\" height=\"749\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Natadola is one of the few public access beaches on the mainland of Fiji\u2019s Viti Levu. It's just a 40minute drive from the popular tourist resort area Denarau Island, near Nadi. With long stretches of white sand gently fading into the turquoise waters, the snorkelling right off the beach is among the best in Fiji, with plenty of colourful tropical fish darting in and out of their coral hidey-hole. Expect to snorkel with parrotfish, schools of sergeant fish and plenty of brightly coloured little damselfish. Along the beach, refresh and rehydrate with a fresh drinking coconut or a beachfront massage at any of the local stalls next to the Intercontinental Resort, which is situated on the beach. You can go horse riding along the sand or even try surfing. The usually calm waters make this beach ideal for stand-up paddle boarding. Natadola is a favourite in Fiji because of its easy location and excellent swimming and snorkelling so close to the mainland. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aleney de Winter, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boyeatsworld.com.au\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.boyeatsworld.com.au<\/a>, adores the fish poop of Amedee Island, New Caledonia:<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1750\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/27.-New-Caledonia.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting the gorgeous beaches of New Caledonia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amedee Island - A tiny coral atoll about 24-kilometres south of New Caledonia\u2019s Noumea, Amedee Island is one great big, ridiculously beautiful beach. \u00a0Surrounded by swaying palm trees, pristine white sand (which is basically a giant pile of fish poop, or minute excrements of coral sediment, to be more precise) and retina-searingly blue water filled with coral gardens, Amedee Island is also home to one of the tallest lighthouses in the world. It is from its soaring antique tower that visitors can best take in the beauty of this impossibly pretty patch of the Pacific. \u00a0An abundance of marine life and its surrounding lagoon has seen Amedee Island classified on the UNESCO World Heritage List. \u00a0Just metres from the beach you\u2019ll find yourself snorkelling alongside dozens of graceful green sea turtles, all of whom are absolute pros at selfies. Or maybe, if you are lucky, you can try stand up paddle boarding alongside a friendly dugong. \u00a0That is when you aren\u2019t dodging the sea snakes slithering up and down the beach. They\u2019re non-aggressive but venomous and it is advised to give them a wide berth. Shame no one told the bolshy sea serpent that swam right between my legs on its way to sunbake on the irresistibly pretty beach. <\/span>\r\n<h2>And one beach in\u00a0California<\/h2>\r\n<span id=\"USA\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, somewhat surprisingly, I only had one submission from the USA<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nisha Hood, <a href=\"http:\/\/wherenishagoing.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http:\/\/wherenishagoing.com<\/a>, enjoys the Californian vibes on Manhattan Beach:<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1751\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/28.-California.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting Manhattan Beach in California\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I visited many beaches in the last few years. I always get asked which one is my favourite. Without hesitant, I reply Manhattan Beach in California. Some of my friends and family are shocked at my answer because I currently live about thirty minutes away from Manhattan Beach. \u00a0Before I moved to California I had an image in my mind that all beaches are perfect and relaxing. Like most people visiting Los Angeles, the first beaches I visited were Santa Monica Pier and Venice Beach. My picture perfect beach image was shattered at these interesting and very crowded beaches. Theses beaches are still nice just not what I pictured. The first time I visited Manhattan Beach I instantly feel in love. The whole city of Manhattan Beach is welcoming and has California beach vibes written all over the place. The beach is picture perfect with amazing blue water. My favourite is spot is up by the viewpoints aligned with turquoise rails, perfect area to watch the local surfers catch waves, and people on the sand playing volleyball. I recommend everyone to visit Manhattan Beach when in the Los Angeles area to experience a more authentic California beach. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So there you have it, 28 of the best beaches as recommended by travel bloggers. As I mention throughout there are some surprising inclusions and exclusions. I thought there would be more from Europe, I noticed that beached in Italy are missing and I thought there would be more Spanish beaches included. You may have noticed two continents are missing, has anyone been to the beach in Africa or South America \u2026 I thought Brazilian beaches would be here for sure.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I just want to finish with a big thank you to all the bloggers who helped to create this post, be sure to check out their pages for loads of great travel stories and advice.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1761\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"735\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1761\" src=\"https:\/\/www.thetravelblogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/28-of-the-Worlds-Best-Beaches-as-chosen-by-travel-bloggers.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"735\" height=\"1102\" \/> Love it?
