            These terms and conditions are our “Terms of Use” and represent a legally binding agreement between you and us regarding your use of our
            Websites. These Terms of Use, however, are not the only terms and conditions that apply to you and your legal agreement with us includes our Privacy Policy
            and other terms and conditions that we refer to in these Terms of Use or our Privacy Policy or those that we disclose or notify you when you use or attempt
            to use some of the features and functions that may be available to you as a user of any of our Websites (“Additional Terms”). Our Websites
            include all web pages within the Website and also include backup, mirror, replacement or substitute sites or pages we make available as part of the
            services we provide. We will refer to each and every feature, function, service, activity, promotion and content on our Websites, individually and/or
            collectively as “Content” and when we use the term “Website” it also included Content unless we specifically say otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Advertising Council, Inc. or the “Ad Council”, its sponsors, suppliers and agencies may also be referred to individually and/or
            collectively as “we”, “us” or “our” and we will refer to users of our Websites, our features, functions and services
            individually and/or collectively as “users”, “you” or “your” to make reading these materials easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you see the word “use" or "using" we mean any time you, directly or indirectly, with or without the help of any device, attempt to or actually
            do access, interact, display, view, browse, print or copy, transmit, receive or exchange data, messages, content or you otherwise communicate with us or
            anyone else, including another user, advertiser or any person, firm or business you may encounter. We will also consider you to be using our Website if you
            utilize, benefit, take advantage of or interact with any feature, function, service, activity, promotion or content in, on or available through any of our
            Websites, for any purpose, or if you try to do any of these things.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you use any of our Websites you are acknowledging you have read and understand the legal agreement you have with us, including these Terms of Use, our
            Privacy Policy and any Additional Terms and that unless you immediately stop using or trying to use all of our Websites, you will be signifying your
            agreement to be legally bound by and comply with all of the terms and conditions that apply to you so you are aware of the current rights and obligations
            that apply to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>WE CAN CHANGE OUR WEBSITES AND OUR TERMS OF USE</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We reserve the right, at any time and from time to time, for any reason in our sole discretion, to add to, delete or modify any or all the terms of the
            Terms of Use that apply to you, as well as any of our Websites and/or any Content. We will post or display a notice of material changes to any of our Terms
            of Use on any and all Websites affected by the change and once we post them, these changes on the effective date specified. If you use any of the affected
            Websites after the changes become effective, it means you are agreeing to be bound by the changes. You should check on a regular and frequent basis and
            review the terms and conditions that apply to you so you are aware of the current rights and obligations that apply to you.

            <strong>PRIVACY</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We respect your privacy. Our Privacy Policy is incorporated into and forms a part of these Terms of Use and part of our agreement with you. Read it
            carefully since it describes, among other things, how we collect and use information we obtain when you use our Websites.

            <strong>WHO OWNS THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER CONTENT RIGHTS</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Each of our Websites and, except as described below, all Content, is either our property or the property of our affiliates, licensors, suppliers,
            operational service providers, advertisers, agencies or promotional partners, and are legally protected, without limitation, under U.S. federal and state
            laws and regulations, as well as applicable foreign laws, regulations and treaties. To avoid any doubt, when we use “Content” it includes, but
            isn’t limited to, such things as software, code, design, text, images, photographs, illustrations, animations, audio, video and audio-visual
            material, art, graphic material, proprietary information, data, databases, service marks, trademarks, trade names, distinctive identification such as
            logos, the selection, sequence, 'look and feel' and arrangement of items and all copyrightable or otherwise legally protectible elements of any and all of
            our Websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            You keep ownership to any and all Content that is yours and if you submit or provide Content, these Terms of Use do not deprive you or any holder of your
            or their rights. However, when you do submit or provide Content to us or any of our Websites, you are giving us an unconditional, irrevocable,
            transferable, royalty free worldwide license to use, display, reproduce, perform, adapt, translate, modify, create derivative works, publish, distribute,
            disseminate and/or broadcast that Content (“license”) and you are representing and warranting to us you have the right to give us such license.
            If you do not have the right to license Content to us (or if you are not sure), do not submit or provide Content to us.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may only use our Content and Content of other users for your own personal use and you have no right to transfer, assign or use the Content for any
            other purpose or allow or enable anyone else to do so. Personal use means nothing commercial or even charitable, whether or not money or other compensation
            or consideration is involved and whether or not it is for your benefit or for someone else. This also means you are not allowed to use, display, reproduce,
            perform, adapt, translate, modify, create derivative works, publish, distribute, disseminate and/or broadcast Content that is not yours without our express
            prior written consent. You may not alter, delete or conceal copyright or other notices, even if we let you download, display, print or share the Content
            with others. Unauthorized or prohibited use of Content may subject you to civil liability, criminal prosecution, or both under federal, state and local
            laws.
          </p>

            <strong>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you see or use any links or conduits on our Websites which allow you to browse, redirect or visit any other websites, web pages or other internet or
            web-based locations, that does not mean we are associated with or have endorsed, reviewed or even know anything about that site or page and we have no
            obligation, responsibility or liability to you or anyone else if you go to another web site, page or address outside our Websites, even if a link on our
            site allowed you to do so. When you leave our Websites, you should inquire and confirm from them the terms and conditions, privacy and other policies that
            apply to you since we neither control, nor have any responsibility for any third party sites, their practices or anything associated with their operations.
            In fact, even if another web site or web page has our name, logo or other identification normally associated with us, it may or may not be authorized and
            you should not assume it is our Website, unless it actually says so and the terms of use that apply to you are these Terms of Use.

            <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            THIS IS OUR OFFICIAL PRIVACY POLICY, WHICH IS PART OF OUR TERMS OF USE AND FORMS A PART OF YOUR LEGAL AGREEMENT WITH US. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY SINCE IT
            DESCRIBES THE TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT, HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION, THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WE DISCLOSE OR SHARE INFORMATION AND HOW YOU
            CAN ACCESS, UPDATE OR DELETE CERTAIN INFORMATION WE HAVE COLLECTED ABOUT YOU.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any terms not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in our Terms of Use.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            When you access or visit any of our Websites, we and our operational service providers and others who host our Websites often use technology that can
            recognize, collect and/or transmit information that is associated with you, but which do not personally identify you. Although the term “cookie”
            specifically refers to a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes, we will use the term “cookie” to refer
            generically to any technology that can recognize, collect and/or transmit information about your visits to our Websites. This type of information includes
            such data as the Internet or web domain that referred you, the type of operating system and browser you are using, the date and time of your visit, data
            relating to activities on our Websites (e.g., so-called ‘clickstream’ data) and other technological attributes about your visit to our Websites. This
            information is used to analyze trends, administer our Websites, track user movements on our Websites, gather aggregate demographic information about
            visitors so we can continually improve our Websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies also allow our Websites to recognize a users’ computer or access device each time it is used to visit a particular Website and cookies can keep
            count of how often you return. Cookies can also track how you use our Websites, your preferences for features and functions and, for Websites that have
            registration or similar features, cookies can store information such as your user name and password so you don’t have to re-enter them each time you return
            to visit. Cookies don’t personally identify you or any particular user or individual.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can disable or turn the cookie feature off by changing the settings on your Internet browser and you can also change the settings to stop your browser
            from automatically accepting cookies. Although changing these settings may not affect your ability to browse, it may affect your ability to use certain
            features and functions of our Websites and it may also require you to re-enter certain information each time you visit or attempt to use our Websites. You
            should consult the operating instructions that apply to your browser to determine how to best configure your browser settings for your needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We use the term “Personal Information” to refer to any information you provide in connection with your use of any of our Websites by which you can be
            personally identified. Personal Information may include such things as your name, street address, telephone number, date of birth, e-mail address and any
            other information which might reasonably be used to identify you. We only obtain Personal Information from you when you submit it to us or provide it on
            one or more of our Websites that require it in order to allow you to register, subscribe or take advantage of certain features, functions, services,
            activities, promotions and content on our Websites (these are referred to as “Content” in our Terms of Use). You may also email us with a question or for
            more information and we will use your contact information (which includes Personal Information such as an email address) to help us respond and for
            customer service purposes. Unless you voluntary provide or send us Personal Information, we will always ask you to submit or provide it to us before
            collecting your Personal Information, although you may not be able to use the particular Content, if you choose not to provide your Personal Information.
            If you provide or submit your Personal Information to any of our Websites, we will always give you the right to review, update and/or delete your Personal
            Information, subject to our obligations to comply with legal, regulatory our internal audit and record-keeping requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to this Privacy Policy, each of our Websites that ask you to submit or provide Personal Information, will have additional disclosures and
            information (“Supplemental Privacy Policies”) that describe how that Website collects, uses, shares and maintains your Personal Information and each of
            those Supplemental Privacy Policies are incorporated and form a part of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use when you use that Website and provide or
            submit Personal Information.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>SPONSORS, ADVERTISERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Websites may contain or display information from our sponsors, advertisers, operational service providers (see Disclosure to Third Parties below) or
            others (each, a “Third Party”) that offer to make information, goods or services available, provide opportunities to participate in promotions or engage in
            activities or that link or redirect your browser to other websites, materials or organizations. We may also use Third Parties to display or serve
            advertising on our Websites, as well as for distributing our online, email, messaged or web-based newsletters and other information. Third Parties often
            also employ cookies to measure advertising effectiveness. You should be aware that even if you encounter an advertisement, link or reference to a Third
            Party website on one of our Websites and even if we have a relationship with them, we do not control them, their websites or their policies and practices
            regarding use of their websites or any rules they have regarding the use of cookies or collection, use or disclosure of your information (including
            Personal Information). These are within their control and not ours and the terms and conditions, as well as the privacy policies that apply to these Third
            Parties and their websites are their responsibility, not ours.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>DISCLOSURE TO THIRD PARTIES</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not sell, rent, lease, provide or otherwise disclose your Personal Information to unaffiliated entities unless the Supplemental Privacy Policy that
            applies to your use of a particular Website. We will always let you know if we intend to provide any of your Personal Information to a Third Party, you
            will always have an opportunity to read and review the Supplemental Privacy Policy that applies and we will ask you to consent ("Opt in") whenever we
            intend to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            We always have the right to disclose your Personal Information to any Third Party we engage for the purpose of administering, operating, configuring site
            design, maintaining and providing internal support for our Websites and Content on our Websites. These Third Parties are called operational service
            providers that provide internal support to operations and activities and/or for Site design, development, hosting and operations. We always request that
            our operational service providers protect your privacy and not disclose your Personal Information to third party marketers that are not associated with our
            Websites, nor are they permitted to use your Personal Information for their own marketing or promotional purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also reserve the right to make your Personal Information available:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When we are compelled by a governmental agency, law, regulation, a court or other legal process;
            </li>
            <li>
              If we believe you are, have or may violate any law, regulation, our Terms of Use;
            </li>
            <li>
              If we believe you are or may be a threat to safety, property, interests or rights of us or others;
            </li>
            <li>
              In order to investigate, respond to or resolve problems or inquiries or defend our interests;
            </li>
            <li>
              In a merger, acquisition, change of control, joint venture or other business combination.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You should also be aware we are public service organization and simply because a website or web page includes our logo, name or otherwise refers to us,
            does not mean the website or web page is ours or under our control. We work with sponsors, advertisers and government agencies to bring you public service
            advertising and if you enter, provide or submit Personal Information on or to a co-branded website or web page you may be subject to the terms, conditions
            and privacy policies of the Third Party sponsor, advertiser, government agency or co-branding organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We only use information that we collect or obtain when you use our Websites as described in this Privacy Policy, for our internal research purposes or to
            ensure compliance with our Terms of Use. If we or any of our Websites collect, maintain, use or intend to share your Personal Information for other
            purposes than as described in this Privacy Policy, we will ensure that is included within the Supplemental Privacy Policy that applies to the Website or
            Websites involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>SECURITY</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We maintain reasonable standards of security and confidentiality. We also try to limit information access to individuals who need to have such access to
            perform their responsibilities associated with our Websites and the Content on our Websites. Any employee found violating our standards of security and
            confidentiality is subject to our disciplinary processes. We request our operational service providers to follow the same policy. The Internet, however,
            and communications cannot be guaranteed to be secure and it is possible that others may unlawfully intercept or access information, transmissions or
            communications to, from or within our Websites.

          <p>
            <strong>YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING PERSONAL INFORMATION.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to any terms, conditions or rights that are described in any Supplemental Privacy Policy applicable to particular Websites, you always have the
            right to request that: (i) we correct or update your Personal Information; (ii) we not share your Personal Information with third parties; or (iii) your
            Personal Information be removed from our active marketing databases. Although we will usually provide you with the ability to update or delete Personal
            Information directly online, some Personal Information may not be changed or deleted by you and requires you to contact us for verification (e.g., birth
            date, email address, name). The Supplemental Privacy Policy that applies to the Website will provide you with the email address or contact information that
            applies to that Website so that you can contact us with a request to change that type of information.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are a resident of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, you have the right to request information on how to exercise your
            disclosure choice options from companies conducting business in California. For each Website that collects or obtains any Personal Information from you,
            our Supplemental Privacy Policy will provide you details, as well as contact information for the Privacy Administrator for that Website and specifics
            regarding how to send us a request for information. All requests sent via postal mail must be labeled "Your California Privacy Rights" on the envelope or
            post card and clearly stated on the actual request. We will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile and we are not responsible for requests
            that are not labeled, are not sent properly, or that do not have complete information.
