<div class='title'>Cooler Master Real Power Pro 1000W PSU 10 Year Redux</div>
<div class='description'>Doing computer PSU reviews for over a decade, and keeping full documentation on those, gives us ability to do something that whets computer PSU enthusiasts' appetites. We get to take some of those PSUs that have been in service for 10 years and retest those. Cooler Master is back on the load bank! How does it look after a decade of service&#63; </div>

<p><span id='intelliTXT'>The good news just keeps coming for Nvidia. In an article from Notebookcheck, they are advising people purchasing an ultrabook with GeForce MX150 graphics to be on the lookout for an underclocked, less powerful GPU hiding under the same name, and not advertised as such. They have discovered two variants of the MX150 in various laptops, the standard has an ID of 1D10, and another with the ID of 1D12. The 1D12 has been found in 13 inch ultrabooks, and has a 36% lower base clock, and 20-25% less performance than the 1D10. Things like this make me wonder if someone thinks I'm an 1D10T. </p><p>

<blockquote><p>While we don't have an issue with selling multiple variants of the same silicon, it's disappointing to not see any marketing material differentiating between the two versions especially since their performance deltas are more than marginal. Casual gamers or heavy users looking for full performance out of the MX150 should double-check new notebooks before committing to a full purchase.</p></blockquote></p><p>

<p><span id='intelliTXT'>Long time HardOCP reader, Eric Crowley of Stockton, California, had a dangerous moment with his Samsung Note 8 this morning. His daughter has been making good grades at school so she was awarded with a new pair of earrings. Eric was taking a couple of pictures with his Samsung Note 8 so he could show his daughter how those looked on her. On snapping his third picture, he heard pop similar to what popping shipping bubble sheet sounds like. As you can see below, the glass cover over the Note 8's rear facing cameras "exploded" outward onto this daughter. The explosion was akin to an old fashioned flash bulb! Eric explained she had glass residue on her that was of a "dusty shiny particle" consistency from her cheek back to her ear. Thankfully none of the glass particles got into her eyes, but to be on the safe side due to the size of the tiny fragments he had her eyes irrigated just in case. He said she is fine and not injured, thankfully. Erik has been using his Note 8 for about 7 months, was at 98% charge, and previously undamaged.</p><p>

</p><p>
Looking around the net, it does not seem to be terribly common, but some other instances of "self breaking glass" on the Note 8 are out there. Something to keep in mind before you go stuffing your camera in someone's face. Thanks for sharing Erik, and we are glad you daughter is OK. We are happy about her grades as well. And having a good dad supporting that achievement. Just don't try to blind her with your camera next time! </p><p>

<p><span id='intelliTXT'>Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has broken his silence on the <a href="https://www.hardocp.com/news/2018/03/18/50_million_facebook_profiles_harvested_for_cambridge_analytica_in_major_data_breach" target="_blank">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> today in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104712037900071" target="_blank">Facebook post</a>. Zuckerberg basically gave a timeline of events, starting at the creation of Facebook, leading up to the event. Zuckerberg states that "This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook." Alleging that Cambridge Analytica got the data from a personality quiz app made by Aleksandr Kogan, and both Kogan and Cambridge Analytica were supposed to have deleted the data.</p><p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
Sounds like a lot of "it wasn't our fault" lip service to me. I understand that under their previous rules, apps could get user data from the friends of people who had installed it (why that was ever a "feature" remains a mystery), but even so, how does 300,000 people installing this quiz app equate to 50 million profiles&#63; Zuckerberg will have an interview tonight on "Anderson Cooper 360" on CNN at 9PM ET.</p><p>
</p><p>
<blockquote><p>We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you. I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again. The good news is that the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago. But we also made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.</p></blockquote></p><p>

<p><span id='intelliTXT'>Electronic Arts has released the official PC<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/a-way-out/news/system-requirements" target="_blank"> system requirements</a>, as well as a launch trailer for the upcoming <i>A Way Out</i>. <i>A Way Out</i> is a cinematic so-op only game, designed for playing in split screen, either locally or online, where you and a friend escape from prison. </p><p>
</p><p>
The system requirements seem fairly friendly as well. </p><p>
</p><p>
MINIMUM PC REQUIREMENTS: 720P 30 FPS AT LOW SETTINGS </p><p>
<blockquote><p>CPU: Intel core i3-2100T @ 2.5GHz/AMD FX 6100, or better</p><p>
RAM: 8GB</p><p>
GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650Ti 2GB, AMD Radeon HD 7750 2GB</p><p>
Hard Drive: 25GB</p><p>
Input: At least one Xbox-compatible/PlayStation-compatible controller</p></blockquote></p><p>
</p><p>
RECOMMENDED PC REQUIREMENTS: 1080P 60 FPS AT HIGH SETTINGS</p><p>
<blockquote><p>RAM: 16GB</p><p>
CPU: Intel Core i5 3570K; AMD Ryzen 3 1300x or equivalent</p><p>
GPU: Nvidia GTX 960; AMD R9 290 or equivalent</p><p>
Hard Drive: 25GB</p><p>
Input: At least one Xbox-compatible/PlayStation-compatible controller</p></blockquote></p><p>

</p><p>
Game looks like it is going to be a lot of fun, but what is up with the requirement of using a controller&#63; One very cool thing is quoted below, apparently you can invite a friend to play the game, even if they don't own it. Still doesn't make up for Battlefront II, but it's a very nice step. </p><p>
</p><p>
<blockquote><p>As a full game owner, you can also invite your friends to play A Way Out for free. All you need to do is send your friend a game invite, and then they will need to download the friends pass free trial from the digital store. That's it! After this is done, you're all set to experience the entire game online with your friend playing for free.</p></blockquote></p><p>

<p><span id='intelliTXT'>After reading this interview, with <i>The Stanley Parable</i> game creator, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-stanley-parable-creator-wants-his-next-game-to-defy-the-rules-of-games/" target="_blank">at PC Gamer</a> I came away not sure if the game dev knows what his next game is or will be. Then that got me thinking about how many years it has been since I "played" <i>Stanley</i>, and looked it up; almost five years ago. Then I saw that I "played" <i>Stanley</i> for 31 hours (almost 2 hours per ending), and that made me hope that I had alt-tabbed out of the game and just left it open on my desktop for a full day or so. Otherwise that 31 hours of play-time truly drives the satire home.</p><p>

<blockquote><p>"What would a game be like where you make interesting choices, but you can't get better at making those choices, or you can't make more optimized choices&#63; What about a game where you're growing or making progress in an interesting way, but where the outcomes are obscure enough that you can't see what the outcomes will lead to&#63; What about a game that has a story, but you don't need to see every piece of content to get the story&#63;</p><p>
</p><p>
"All of these sound counterintuitive, but that's why I'm so excited. The bizarre, impossible-sounding goal I've set for myself is to create a game that does all of these things. I don't have a good answer yet as to how exactly I'll do that." </p></blockquote></p><p>

<h3><a target='_blank' href='/news/2018/03/20/amd_responds_to_cts_labs_vulnerability_claims' title="AMD Responds To CTS Labs Vulnerability Claims">AMD Responds To CTS Labs Vulnerability Claims</a></h3>
<p><span id='intelliTXT'><a href="https://www.hardocp.com/news/2018/03/13/amd_cpu_attack_vectors_vulnerabilities" target="_blank">Last week</a> we wrote about possible AMD security flaws that were announced by CTS Labs. Today, AMD has released their assessment of CTS Labs' claims in a <a href="https://community.amd.com/community/amd-corporate/blog/2018/03/20/initial-amd-technical-assessment-of-cts-labs-research" target="_blank">community post</a>. AMD makes it clear that the issues identified by CTS Labs have nothing to do with Meltdown and Spectre, but are associated with the firmware that manages the AMD Secure Processor, as well as the chipset used in some AM4 and TR4 motherboards. </p><p>
</p><p>
AMD Notes that all issues raised in the CTS Labs report require administrative access to the machine in order to implement, meaning before any of these exploits could be used, an attacker would already have full control of the system, and can essentially, do whatever they want. Despite this, AMD is releasing a firmware patch that will be available via BIOS update, and will not have any expected impact on system performance to address the issues. An article on <a href="https://www.pcper.com/news/Processors/AMD-finalizing-fixes-Ryzen-EPYC-security-vulnerabilities" target="_blank">PCPer </a>goes into more depth. </p><p>
</p><p>
In addition CTS Labs has posted a video on YouTube, showing proof-of-concept for the Masterkey-1 exploit. In the video CTS Labs shows them installing a modified BIOS for a TYAN motherboard which makes the screen flicker during boot. </p><p>
</p><p>
<div align="center"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RrhVhFHTe9o" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p><p>
</p><p>
The integrity of CTS Labs has <a href="https://www.hardocp.com/news/2018/03/14/much_amddo_about_nothing" target="_blank">come into question</a>, since they published the vulnerabilities last week, to where even<a href="https://www.hardocp.com/news/2018/03/16/linus_torvalds_gives_his_opinion_on_latest_amd_security_bugs" target="_blank"> Linus Torvalds</a> spoke about it in his signature style. I find it interesting that CTS Labs has decided to disable comments and hige the like/dislike ratio for the video above. And I find it impressive that AMD is going to release a patch for this, despite the fact the attacker must already have full access to the machine, as well as know what motherboard it is using in order to write a custom BIOS. Still seems quite shady to me. </p><p>

<p><span id='intelliTXT'>Just over two weeks after Kyle broke the story of the <a href="https://www.hardocp.com/article/2018/03/08/geforce_partner_program_impacts_consumer_choice" target="_blank">Geforce Partner Program</a> and its potential anti-consumer policies, the silence from Nvidia and it's partners has been deafening. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/03/20/new-clues-suggest-msi-and-gigabyte-are-aligned-with-geforce-partner-program/#69df53f4c6a1" target="_blank">Forbes published an article today</a>, in which writer Jason Evangelho outlines that is isn't just Kyle who has been getting the cold shoulder. Jason states that while performing his own follow-up to the HardOCP investigation, all of his contacts have gone dark, including a few who had agreed to speak off the record. However Jason does state "I had two brief conversations that made it obvious the program was troublesome, to put it mildly."</p><p>
</p><p>
Jason also points out a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/85n378/nvidia_gpps_first_victim/&#63;sort=new" target="_blank">Reddit thread</a> that was posted today, pointing out the GPP had claimed its "first victim." Further digging found nothing amiss at Asus' website, with plenty of ROG Radeon offerings. However the MSI product page for their "Gaming X" branded GPUs are devoid of Radeon cards. As well Gigabyte has released a new external GPU enclosure, housing an RX 580, which is suspiciously devoid of any AUROS branding, unlike the NVIDIA counterparts. <a href="https://www.computerbase.de/2018-03/gigabyte-gaming-box-rx-580/" target="_blank">ComputerBase.de</a> reached out to Gigabyte about why this model was not under the brand for "players," and were told by Gigabyte that the focus of the RX 580 enclosure is not on "players."</p><p>

</p><p>
It is quite telling how many outlets, as well as YouTubers have picked up on this story, without one official response from NVIDIA or any AIB partners. Personally it makes me wonder if they are hoping that the outrage will blow over, or if they are preparing for possible litigation. When you have outlets like <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/03/08/report-alleges-new-nvidia-program-engages-in-monopolistic-anti-consumer-practices/#9698a7122419" target="_blank">Forbes</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch&#63;v=HkqpRrzUxQI" target="_blank">Jayztwocents</a> all investigating and keeping the GPP in the news, the lack of response is disconcerting. </p><p>

</p><p>
The article on TorrentFreak also states that the average number of malware files found on a pirate's machine is 1.5, compared to 1.4 for people who never visit any pirate sites. So if you are getting your Linux isos from 3rd party places, it seems like malware shouldn't be much of a concern. </p><p>
</p><p>
<blockquote><p>The research estimates that, when someone doubles the amount of traffic spent on a pirate site, this person adds an extra 0.05 of a piece of malware per month, with the average being 0.24. So, most people encounter no malware in a typical month. This means that pirate sites are an increased a risk, but it&rsquo;s not as extreme as sometimes portrayed.</p></blockquote></p><p>
