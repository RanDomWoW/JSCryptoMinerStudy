<font face ="arial"><font size="3"> <font color="white">Hello there, and welcome to Gaming Hell, the video game website with guts! <i>Huge</i> guts!</center><br>

To be honest, pal- can I call you pal? I know we probably don't know each other but you've essentially entered my home, so we might as well drop formalities- if you've clocked the site's name, then yes, it's what you think it is. Just another video game review/archive website, hosted by your <s>intrepid reporter</s> lackwit writer, Ant Cooke, and 'helped' into 'print' by the long-suffering editor (affectionately known as Ed) who spends most of his time crying into his safety blanket when he sees what I've left for him to edit this time. <font size="1">[Watch it, or I'll knock you spark out! - Ed]<font size="3"> It can be flippant here, and there's the odd swear word (I mean, have you <i>seen</i> some of the crap I've played?) but at its heart, Gaming Hell has only two objectives:<br><br>

<center><font color="white">
To <i>entertain</i> and <i>inform</i> its readership!<br><br></center>
<font color="white">
With that in mind, please, enjoy your stay. On this site, I type a lot of words about (mostly old) video games that interest me. Note that I said <i>interest</i>, not necessarily <i>like</i>. If I can get fired up about it, I'll write a thing on it in the hope that you, the reader, find it interesting too. Furthermore, every game covered on this site in any capacity- be it <a href="games.html">a full play-through</a>, <a href="articles.html">a short article</a>, or <a href="guides.html">a guide</a>- is given as thorough a going-over as I can. I like going into detail! It's fun! Especially since these are usually the kinds of game no-one really cares about- I'd call them mid-tier, as they're not super-obscure but you've probably forgotten their names already. We've got a few sections here, so make your way to the individual hub pages to look at all articles of a specific type, or just dive right into <a href="fullenglish.html">The Full English</a>!<br><br>
<font color="white">
I hope you find this site useful. Just remember, though, that while games are taken seriously here, everything else is a pack of lies. Well, most of it. Oh, and it's updated oncTe a month, give or take, so look forward to it. Comments, suggestions, death threats, etc., can be sent to <b>TheMetalSlug at Gmail dot com</b>.<br><br>

<hr><font color="white">
<center><i><b>Updates!! Fun!!<br><br></i></b>
<font face="arial"></center><font color="white">
<i><b>14th March, 2018</b></i> - 
Two months in a row! It's almost like we have a proper update schedule. This month it's a game you might be familiar with, but a version you need to see- <a href="TimeGalIOS.html">Time Gal on the iPhone</a>. It's a very good port, as it happens! Now, there won't be a 'proper' pdate next month beyond our April Fools' Day update, so please look forward to that. In May though, we'll make our counterattack for our 10th anniversary! Oh God, why is this site 10 years old?!
