						<p>Iron Carbide Iron carbide is a high melting point, non-pyrophoric, strongly magnetic synthetic compound obtained in granular or powder form. It is composed of three atoms of Fe and one atom C and its chemical formula is Fe3C. The commercial iron carbide consists of around 90 % total iron and around 6 % to 6.5 % of total carbon. The primary use of the product is as a metallic charge during steelmaking for substitution of hot metal, direct reduced iron, or steel scrap. Iron carbide is an intermetallic compound of iron and carbon. It is, more precisely, intermediate transition metal carbide. Its stoichiometric composition consists of 6.67 % carbon and 93.3 % iron (Fe) by weight. It has an orthorhombic crystal structure (Fig 1). It is a hard, brittle material and normally classified as a ceramic in its pure form. It is a frequently found and important constituent in ferrous metallurgy. While iron carbide is present in most steels and cast irons, it is produced as a raw material by the iron carbide process, which belongs to the family of alternative ironmaking technologies. Fig 1 Crystal of iron carbide Iron carbide is a premium quality feed for steelmaking in electric arc furnaces and basic oxygen furnaces. It is available as dark gray granules or powder. It offers matchless metallurgical advantages and outstanding cost savings. It has a density of 7.64 kg/cu m and is thus slightly denser than the liquid iron, which has a density of 6.98 kg/cu m. The iron carbide is composed of three atoms of Fe and one atom C and is also known as cementite. Cementite is an intermetallic compound which is hard, brittle, and metastable because it tends to decompose in ferrite (or austenite) and graphite according to the reaction Fe3C = 3 Fe + C. In fact, this transformation is not... </p>

						<p>Competencies and development of competency framework for organization The greatest strength of an organization, and the key to its success, is the quality of its employees and their ability to thrive and fulfill their potential while delivering the output expected from them. The competency framework enables the organization to clarify expectations and to set standards for performance throughout the organization. It is a guide to help management and the employees to understand the behaviours and skills expected of them and what they are to strive for achieving them. The concept of competencies emerged during the early 1980s as a response to the organizational changes. This concept drives the organization towards higher performance levels. During the subsequent decades, competency frameworks have become an increasingly accepted part of modern HR (human resource) practice in the organizations. Competencies A competency is considered to be a cluster of related knowledge, skills, abilities, and characteristics which are related to the performance of a significant aspect of the practice of a profession. The term ‘competency’ is usually defined as a combination of skills, attributes and behaviours which are directly related to the performance on the job. They are important for all the employees regardless of occupation, function, or level. Competencies normally focus on the personal attributes or inputs of employees in the organization. They are the behaviours (and technical attributes where appropriate) which employees are to have, or are to acquire, for their effective performance at work. Competencies are broader concepts which encompass demonstrable performance outputs as well as behaviour inputs, and relate to a system or set of minimum standards required for the performance at the work. Competencies are means to provide organizational focus, as building blocks for human resource systems, and as methods for certifying attainment of various... </p>

						<p>Process for Manufacturing of Iron Carbide Iron carbide (Fe3C) is a high melting point, non-pyrophoric, strongly magnetic synthetic compound obtained in granular form. It consists of around 90 % total iron (Fe) and around 7 % total carbon (C). The primary use of the product is as a metallic charge during steelmaking for substitution of hot metal (HM), direct reduced iron (DRI), or steel scrap. The iron carbide process involves conversion of preheated fine iron ore particles to iron carbide. It reduces iron ore to iron carbide in a fluidized bed reactor, by contacting the iron ore with process gas consisting primarily of methane (CH4) and hydrogen (H2). The process for the manufacturing iron carbide was originally designed and developed at Hazen Research Inc. in Golden, Colorado, USA by the technical vice president Dr. Frank M. Stephens. The process involves reduction of preheated fine iron ore particles (0.1 mm to 1.0 mm) in a closed circuit fluidized bed reactor by preheated process gas containing CH4, H2, CO (carbon mono oxide), CO2 (carbon di oxide) and water vapour(H2O) at 600 deg C. A 50 mm diameter batch reactor was used for the laboratory tests. This was followed by continuous tests on a 600 mm diameter reactor. Iron ore samples from several countries were tested at Hazen. The product was successfully converted to steel by MEFOS in Sweden in a basic oxygen furnace (BOF) in 1979. After the initial laboratory tests at Hazen Research, Inc., Dr. Stephens applied for a patent and was issued on October 11, 1977 ‘US Patent No. 4,053.301’ by the Patent office of the United States. In 1985 Dr. Stephens retired and acquired the rights to the patent on the iron carbide. He formed a company by name ‘Iron Carbide Development Corporation’... </p>

						<p>Tensile Testing of Steel Sample of steel is subjected to a wide variety of mechanical tests to measure their strength, elastic constants, and other material properties as well as their performance under a variety of actual use conditions and environments. Tensile test is one of them. Other tests are hardness test, impact test, fatigue test, and fracture test. These mechanical tests are used to measure how a sample of steel withstands an applied mechanical force. The results of such tests are used for two primary purposes namely (i) engineering design (e.g. failure theories based on strength, or deflections based on elastic constants and component geometry), and (ii) quality control either by the producer of steel to verify the process or by the end user to confirm the material specifications. Uniaxial tensile test is known as a basic and universal engineering test to achieve material parameters such as ultimate tensile strength (UTS), yield strength (YS), % elongation, % area of reduction and young&#8217;s modulus. Tensile testing is done for many reasons. The results of tensile tests are used in selecting materials for engineering applications. Tensile properties are often included in material specifications to ensure quality. Tensile properties are also normally measured during development of new materials and processes, so that different materials and processes can be compared. Also, tensile properties are generally used to predict the behaviour of a material under forms of loading other than uniaxial tension. Safely withstanding the expected maximum load without permanent deformation (or to stay within the specified deflection) is a basic requirement for a steel product. The ‘resistance’ against the load is a function of the cross-section and the mechanical properties (or in other words the ‘strength’) of the steel material. Tensile testing is done to determine the mechanical... </p>

						<p>Organizational Competencies  Organizational competencies are the competencies needed in the organization so that it can excel and remain competitive in the market. The competencies provide an inventory of expected behaviours, skills and attitudes which lead to the successful performance of the organization. Organizational competencies depend heavily on the competencies of the employees of the organization. Organizational competencies, in the most general terms, are those ‘things’ which the employees of the organization are to demonstrate to be effective in their job, role, function, task, or duty. These ‘things’ include (i) job-relevant behaviour (what the employees say or do which result in good or poor performance), (ii) motivation (how the employees feel about a job, organization, or geographic location), and (iii) technical knowledge/skills (what the employees know/demonstrate regarding facts, technologies, their professions, procedures, jobs, and the organization, etc.). Competencies are identified through the study of jobs and roles. The term ‘competency’ is usually defined as a combination of skills, attributes and behaviours which are directly related to successful performance on the job. They are important for all the employees regardless of occupation, function, or level. An efficient organization keeps into focus the competencies on performance development/which enables its employees to align their individual performance with values and strategy while maximizing the individual performance in the pursuit of specific work-related objectives and behaviours. Organizational competencies can be broadly divided into (i) core values, (ii) technical competencies, and (iii) core competencies. Core values are the organizational values which are the shared principles and beliefs. These principles and belief unite all the organizational employees and guide them in their actions. Technical competencies are those specific competencies which are usually required to perform a given job within a job family. Technical competencies cover the various fields of expertise relevant to... </p>

						<p>Circored and Circofer processes of ironmaking Circored and Circofer processes of ironmaking are fluidized bed based iron ore fines reduction processes. These processes completely avoid agglomeration process and make direct use of iron ore fines. Since the processes use non coking coal, necessity of coke oven battery is not there. Fluidized bed technology is ideally suited to energy-intensive processes like direct reduction because it enables high heat and mass transfer rates. Both the Circored and the Circofer processes have been developed by Lurgi Metallurgie GmbH, Germany (now Outotec Oyj, Finland) for the production of direct reduced iron (DRI) from iron ore fines. For both processes, capacities above 1 million tons per annum are possible in a single production unit, resulting in improved economies of scale. Circored process is hydrogen (H2) based process while the Circofer process is coal based. Circored has a two-stage configuration in order to achieve a high metallization of 90 % to 95 %, whereas Circofer has a single-stage configuration which can achieve pre-reduction up to a metallization of around 70 %. Circofer coal-based process produces pre-reduced feed material for smelting reduction reactors, such as AusIron, or electric smelting furnaces &#8211; the final product being hot metal or pig iron. Circored process Circored process uses fluidized beds on a scale adopted by Outotec for other applications. Development of the process was initiated in the late 1970s with the pilot plant tests conducted at the ELRED plant of ASEA in Sweden. Tests were also carried out in the 3 tons per hour CFB reactor demonstration unit at Thyssen Stahl in Duisburg, Germany. These tests had focused on the treatment of steel plant wastes. The first commercial Circored unit was built in 1998 by Cliffs and Associates Ltd. at Point Lisas Industrial Complex... </p>

						<p>Corrosion in Steels – Its Types and Testing Corrosion is a universal natural process. The effect of corrosion is seen in every-day life in the form of rusted steel parts. Corrosion has a huge economic impact. About a fifth of the global annual steel production goes towards simply replacing steel parts damaged by corrosion. Even though it involves higher up-front cost, correct and efficient corrosion protection at the source helps save money and resources in the long run. Failure due to corrosion can result into dramatic consequences. Corrosion is the gradual degradation of a metal by chemical, often electrochemical reaction with the surrounding environment. Corrosion results into loss of material properties such as mechanical strength, appearance, and impermeability to liquids and gases. Whether steel is corrosion resistant in a specific environment depends on the combination of the chemical composition of steel and the aggressiveness of the environment. As per ISO 8044:2010, corrosion is the physicochemical interaction between a metal and its environment, which results in changes in the metal’s properties and which may lead to significant functional impairment of the metal, the environment, or the technical system of which they form a part. Corrosion takes place when there is a change in the steel’s or system’s properties which may lead to an undesirable outcome. This can range simply from visual impairment to complete failure of technical systems which cause great economic damage and even present a hazard to the people. The typical corrosion process can be regarded as the thermodynamically favoured reverse reaction of the metal-winning (extraction) process (Fig 1). Like all chemical reactions, corrosion processes take place when conditions favour the related chemical reactions (thermodynamics). Then, potential other factors drive the speed of the reaction (kinetics). Fig 1  Chemical reactions of iron during... </p>

						<p>Safety in Rolling Mills Worldwide, as the rolling speeds are increasing, greater emphasis is being placed on the aspects of safety while designing the mill equipment as well as during the finalization of the mill layouts. Providing high importance to safety is in the best interest of the designers, manufacturers and the users of the rolling mills. Safeguarding of the mill equipment is necessary for ensuring the safe working of the rolling mill after its commissioning. Manufacturers of the rolling mills have the objective to produce a competitive mill, while users desire to have a highly productive mill. However, before any of these objectives can be met, both the manufacturer and the user are to first determine how to engineer the mill using safe design principles to minimize operator’s risks. Investing in a safer workplace also reduces the expenses of treating injured workers, helps preventing workplace accidents besides boosting employees’ morale by conveying the message that the organization cares about its employees and wants to protect their health and safety. A brief overview of safety requirements for the equipment of rolling mill is given below. Common safety related definitions Safety is the ability of the equipment to perform its function while being transported, installed, adjusted, operated, maintained, dismantled, and disposed of under conditions of intended use specified in the instruction manual without causing injury or damage to health of the people carrying out these functions. Risk is a comprehensive estimate of the probability and the degree of the possible injury or damage to the health in a hazardous situation in order to select appropriate safety measures. Hazard is a condition or set of circumstances which can cause physical harm to the exposed personnel. Danger zone is any zone within or around the equipment in... </p>

						<p>Role of Lubrication during the Process of Metal Working For understanding the role of lubrication during the processes of metal working, it is important to know the tribology of the lubrication. Tribology consists of boundary friction, which is associated with almost all operations of the metal working. It is caused by the relative movement of two adjacent surfaces under pressure. During the metal working processes, the relative movement between rolls and work piece is improved by the surface speed differential of the rolls Friction Friction plays an important role during metal working process. It is defined as the resistance to relative motion between two bodies in contact. It is an energy dissipating process, causing the temperature at the interface to rise and, if excessive, can result in surface damage. It also influences the deformation taking place in the metal working process. As per the earliest theories, friction is the result of interlocking two rough surfaces sliding along each other. Friction is actually brought on by a large number of variables, such as load, speed, temperature, the materials involved in the sliding pair, and the various effects of fluids and gases at the interface. Most commonly accepted theory of friction is based on the resulting adhesion between the severities of the contacting bodies. It has been seen that regardless of how smooth the surfaces are, they contact each other at only a fraction of their apparent area of contact. Thus, the load during the process of metalworking is supported with few severities in contact. Hence, the normal stress at the severity junctions is high. Under light loads, the contact stresses can only be elastic. However, as the load increases to some of the levels involved in the metal working process, elastic deformation of the severities... </p>

						<p>Preference of Steel as a Material of Construction Steel is one of the most widely used materials, particularly in construction, engineering, white goods, and automobile industries. Steel is also used widely in the manufacture of electrical motors, power generation (nuclear, conventional fuels and wind), power transmission, and railway network. It is also used for gears and engines where it has to be very tough and withstand high temperatures. There is a group of steels known as ‘Advanced High Strength Steels’ (AHSS), which are specially treated steels that can be rolled very thin without losing the element of strength needed for the specific purpose.  These steels are particularly useful for the manufacture of automobiles, helping to reduce the overall mass and thus decrease the consumption of the fuel. Steels with a thin coating of tin are used to make cans for beverages and food. Steels coated in various ways with zinc are used in roofing, for example, and in automobiles as the zinc gives protection to steel against corrosion. It is estimated that there are more than 20,000 million tons of steel in use, which means that there is more than 2 tons of steel is in use for every person living on the Earth. The construction industry is the main user of steel. It uses steel from small buildings to huge bridges and uses it in multiple ways even within a single construction.  A bridge, as an example, may use steel in the huge suspension ropes, the steel plate flooring for the road, the beams for the columns, and for the safety barriers and lighting columns. A large amount of steel is also used in the reinforce concrete. In fact, steel is either used or used to produce all the items needed in our daily life.... </p>

						<p>Employee education and training Technologies are changing very fast in today’s world. Latest technologies of yesterday have become outdated today and what is latest today will change tomorrow and newer method of production will replace the traditional methods of production of today. As new technologies have advanced, new procedures and new skills are required and there is an increasing need for skilled and highly trained employees who are able to meet these changing situations in the workplace. These changes require new job requirements and new methods of working which in turn require different combination of expertise, knowledge, and skills. In this environment of growing uncertainty, organizations are to be aware of the need for their businesses to search for new answers to the problems of productivity and quality. As the technology advances, necessity arises for a higher level of skills from the employees of the organization. Studies have shown that there is a long term shift away from unskilled to highly skilled jobs with the advancement of the technology. However, despite this increasing requirement for highly skilled employees, there is evidence that the skills gap in some of the organizations is widening with a growing deficit in key or core skills, which does not augur well for the future for these organizations. Education and training are essential for the development of employees’ capabilities. Both these activities are tied closely together and mutually reinforce each other in the promotion of employees’ development. These activities develop creativity, positive attitude, and a sense of responsibility and also help the employees to attain high degree of motivation.

						<p>PERED Technology for Direct Reduced Iron Production PERED technology is also known as ‘Persian Reduction’ technology. It is the direct reduction technology invented and patented by ‘Mines and Metals Engineering GmbH’ in 2007. The PERED direct reduction process converts iron oxides, in the form of pellets or lump ore, to highly reduced product suitable for steel making. The reduction of iron oxide takes place without its melting with the help of reducing gases in solid state in a vertical shaft furnace. This technology improves the process of direct reduction for the production of direct reduced iron (DRI). The process is a gas based direct reduction process which has been developed by a team of specialists having experience in different areas of the direct reduction process to ensure that all the flows of different processes are taken care in the main process to obtain optimum and efficient results. The most popular gas used for reduction is reformed natural gas though other gases such as Corex gas and coke oven gas etc. can also be used. PERED technology lowers capital cost, water consumption, maintenance cost, and energy consumption. In PERED, the reduction process takes place at a lesser temperature due to the improved cooling methods and reduced pollutant gas emissions. With less heat, more homogeneous reducing gas, more controllable pellet feed and use of centrifugal compressors, PERED requires less water, electricity and gas to operate, alongside less operational and maintenance expenditure. Output from the PERED direct reduction plants can be in the form of (i) cold direct reduced iron (CDRI), hot briquetted iron (HBI), combination of CDRI/HBI, HBI/hot direct reduced iron (HDRI), and CDRI/HDRI. PERED technology is an improved energy efficient technology and hence economizes energy and resources. It makes optimum use of energy and raw materials... </p>

						<p>Alumina and its Role in Iron and Steelmaking Alumina is a chemical compound of aluminum (Al) and oxygen (O2) with the chemical formula aluminum oxide (Al2O3). It is the most commonly occurring of several aluminum oxides. It is significant in its use to produce aluminum metal. It is being used as an abrasive material because of its hardness. It is also being used as a refractory material owing to its high melting point. Aluminum oxide is an amphoteric substance. It can react with both acids and bases, acting as an acid with a base and a base with an acid, neutralizing the other and producing a salt.  It is insoluble in water. Aluminum oxide has a white solid appearance and is odorless. The molar mass of aluminum oxide is 101.96 grams per mole. Specific gravity of alumina is 3.986. It is insoluble in water. Melting point of aluminum oxide is 2072 deg C while the boiling point is 2977 deg C. Alumina affects the processes of producing iron and steel during the production of iron and steel. Besides alumina is a very important refractory material for the lining of furnaces and vessels in iron and steel plants. Role of alumina in ironmaking Alumina during ironmaking enters the process through impurities in the input materials mainly iron ore. Alumina affects the sintering of iron ore. The most harmful effect of alumina is to worsen the RDI (reduction degradation index) value of sinter. RDI value increases as the alumina content rises. It is seen that within a 10 % to 10.5 % CaO content range, an increase of 0.1 % in the alumina content raises the RDI by 2 points. The strength and quality of sinter deteriorate as the alumina content rises. Alumina promotes the formation of SFCA (silico ferrite of calcium and aluminum), which is beneficial for sinter strength, but the strength of the ore components is lower, since a... </p>

						<p>Quality of Decisions and Organizational Performance Quality of decisions made is very important for the smooth functioning of an organization. It is a known fact that decision making is not just about selecting the right choices or compromises. Unless a decision has degenerated into work, it is not a decision. It is at best a good intention. Decisions made become effective only after they are implemented. Organizational management is required to make a large number of decisions on a continuous basis. These decisions are required to be made for the smooth running of the organization. The performance of the organization is greatly influenced by these decisions. Hence, making decisions is a matter of a huge responsibility for the management not only against the organization itself, but against their employees and other stakeholders, as well. The decision making process can be explained as a proposal considered by the management in the context of the organization and its strategic position. Alternatives, risks and potential outcomes are considered and then a decision is reached. There can also be a post audit and a feedback loop. The decision making process of the management is subject to human error as the management personnel have personalities, prejudices and a self-interest bias. Importantly, they have different attitudes to and appetites for risk. The decisions of the management are influenced by the decision making environment which consists of a unity of management’s experience, beliefs and perceptions on one side, and decision support tools and techniques on the other side. For determining the effectiveness of the decision made, the performance of the organization is normally measured on the basis of eight performance parameters. These performance parameters include (i) profitability, (ii) organizational effectiveness, (iii) continuous improvement, (iv) productivity of the processes, (v) quality of... </p>

						<p>Mechanical Processes for Descaling of Steel Scale is the product of oxidation which takes place during hot rolling. The oxidation and scale formation of steel is an unavoidable phenomenon during the process of hot rolling which involve reheating of steel in a reheating furnace, multi-pass hot rolling and air-cooling in the inter-pass delay times and after rolling. Scale formed during the heating of steel to rolling temperatures in the reheating furnace is known as primary scale. This primary scale is removed before hot rolling. It is usually done for producing steel products with high surface quality and for reducing roll wear. However, secondary scale continues to form on the descaled steel surface during the inter-pass delay time in the roughing and intermediate rolling mills. The colour of primary mill scale is generally bluish black while that of the secondary scale is blue.  The secondary scale gives the steel an appearance which is similar to that of a lacquer coating finish and is often mistaken for a blue coloured primer. The primary scale is composed of three well defined layers of iron oxides. Adjacent to the steel is the thickest layer consisting of wustite having an approximate composition of FeO. The intermediate layer consists of magnetite (Fe3O4) while the outermost layer is hematite (Fe2O3). The thicknesses of these layers depend on several factors linked to the rolling of the steel and the availability of oxygen at the steel surface. The layer at the surface of the steel is richest in oxygen and constitutes 0.5 % to 2 % of scale thickness. The layer at the metal surface is richest in iron and constitutes about 85 % of the scale thickness. The intermediate layer of scale constitutes around 13 % to 14.5 % of scale thickness.... </p>

						<p>Limestone and Lime Limestone is an odorless white, grayish-white or tan material that ranges from sized stone to a granular powder. It is often described as the most versatile mineral. Limestone is the name given to any rock formed which consists mostly of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), but to geologists, limestone is only one of several types of carbonate rocks. These rocks are composed of more than 50 % carbonate minerals, generally containing the mineral calcite (pure CaCO3). Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mainly of CaCO3. It is formed by the deposition either of the skeletons of small creatures and/or plants (organic limestones), or by chemical precipitation, or by deposition of fragments of limestone rock, on the beds of seas and lakes. Limestones are contaminated to a greater or lesser extent by the deposition of sand or clay which is the source of the impurities usually found in the limestone. Generally there is a difference in quality in a deposit from one layer to the next. The purest carbonates and the most suitable from the production point of view tend to be the thick bedded type. Carbonate deposits may be found in horizontal layers as deposited, or at an angle from the horizontal due to earth movements. They will vary in density, hardness and chemical purity. Limestone rocks are extremely common and make up a significant portion of the crust of the Earth. They serve as one of the largest carbon repositories on our planet. The properties of limestone make it one of the most widely used minerals. Some limestones may contain small percentage of magnesium carbonate (MgCO3). These limestones are known as dolomitic limestones. Impurities (such as clay, sand, organic remains, iron oxide, and other materials) cause limestones to show different colours, especially with weathered surfaces. Limestone may be crystalline, clastic, granular,... </p>

						<p>Standardization and the Process of Standardization There is practically no economic activity nowadays which is not outlined, whether partly or totally, by the process of standardization. The worldwide acceptance of standardization is closely related to the economic globalization and the transformation of regulatory processes at the national, regional, and international levels. Standardization helps in reducing, simplifying, and organizing matters which are apt to become diversified, complicated, and chaotic if left uncontrolled. It is the process of formulating, issuing, and implementing standards. Standardization creates value at many levels. The output of the process of standardization is the creation of standards. The development of standardization as an engineering activity was pioneered in 1793 by Eli Whitney. Standardization of screw threads by Sir Joseph Whitworth dates back to 1841. Other instances of early standardization can be found during the emergence of the railway industry. Mass production became possible only through standardization. By the turn of the 19th century, standardization was already recognized in industrialized countries as a powerful tool to increase productivity through interchangeability and reduction of variety. The early part of the 20th century saw the establishment of several standardization organizations, which turned standardization into an organized and ongoing effort for industrial applications. By 1928, national standards organizations had been established in 16 industrialized countries. After the First World War, standardization, through reduction in variety, was established as a useful management tool for reducing costs. Some three decades later, seller market conditions, which prevailed for some time after the Second World War, put consumer interest under threat. To safeguard this interest and to meet the rising demand for standards for finished products, standardization activities increased in various countries, with the additional support and involvement of government and industry Definitions of standardization The standardization process is often... </p>

						<p>Limestone – Its Processing and Application in Iron and Steel Industry Limestone is a naturally occurring and abundant sedimentary rock consisting of high levels of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the form of the mineral calcite. Some limestones may contain small percentage of magnesium carbonate (MgCO3). These limestones are known as dolomitic limestones. Limestone is also a very important industrial mineral. Its chemical properties make it a valuable mineral for a wide range of industrial/manufacturing uses. Limestone is also one of the vital raw materials used in production of iron and steel. Limestone, by definition, is a rock that contains at least 50 % of CaCO3 in the form of calcite by weight. There can be small particles of quartz (silica), feldspar (alumino-silicates), clay minerals, pyrite (iron sulphide), siderite (iron carbonate), and other minerals associated with the limestone. All limestones contain at least a few percent other materials. The Impurities in limestone can consists of silica (SiO2), alumina (Al2O3), iron oxide (Fe2O3), sulphur (as sulphides or sulphates), phosphorus (P2O5), potash (K2O), and soda (Na2O). Silica and alumina are the main impurities of limestone. The limestone which is used in ironmaking is required to contain at least 85 % of calcium carbonate and a low percentage of alumina. Similarly limestone which is used for steelmaking is required to contain at least 92 % of calcium carbonate and a very low percent of impurities especially the silica percentage. The main uses of limestone in iron and steel industry are (i) as a fluxing material, and (ii) other usage which consists of desulphurizing agent, coating of moulds of pig casting machine, neutralizing of acidic water, water treatment, waste water(effluent) treatment, flue gas treatment, and sludge and sewage treatment. It is also a component of synthetic slag. Limestone is... </p>

						<p>Dolomite – A Useful Mineral Dolomite is also known as dolostone and dolomite rock.  It is a sedimentary rock which primarily consists of the mineral dolomite. It is found in sedimentary basins worldwide. Dolomite rock is similar to limestone rock. Both dolomite and limestone rocks share the same colour ranges of white-to-gray and white-to-light brown (although other colours such as red, green, and black are also possible). Both the rocks have approximately the same hardness, and they are both soluble in dilute hydrochloric (HCl) acid. The original mineral name ‘dolomie’ was given by NT Saussare, in 1792, in honor of the French geologist Deodat Guy de Dolomieu (1750–1801). Dolomite, the rock, contains a large proportion of dolomite the mineral. Ideal dolomite has a crystal lattice consisting of alternating layers of Ca and Mg, separated by layers of CO3 and is typically represented by a stoichiometric chemical composition of CaMg(CO3)2, where calcium and magnesium are present in equal proportions. Dolomite originates in the same sedimentary environments as limestone i.e. in warm, shallow, marine environments where calcium carbonate (CaCO3) mud accumulates in the form of shell debris, fecal material, coral fragments, and carbonate precipitates. Dolomite is thought to form when the calcite in carbonate mud or limestone is modified by magnesium-rich groundwater. The available magnesium facilitates the conversion of calcite into dolomite. This chemical change is known as dolomitization. Dolomitization can completely alter a limestone into a dolomite, or it can partially alter the rock to form a dolomitic limestone. Dolomite is a complex mineral. It is relatively a soft mineral which can be easily crushed to a soft powder. The mineral is an anhydrous carbonate mineral consisting of a double carbonate of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg). It is chemically represented by CaMg(CO3)2 or CaCO3.MgCO3. It theoretically contains... </p>

						<p>Standards and their importance for the Organizations The modern and globalized world cannot exist without standards which are sup­porting cooperation, trade, health, safety, and economic growth etc. In fact, standards exist in almost all aspects of modern life. They range from standards in information and communication technology which ensure the interoperability of diverse components to standards for the quality of products or services, and underlie areas ranging from the harmonization of international accounting systems to the governance of the social and environmental performance of the organizations. Stand­ards have a huge influence on everyday life. They play a key role in an environment where an organization is to be at its best for achieving success. They are open access documents with no charge or license fee for their use, apart from the cost of its purchase. The development of standardization as an engineering activity was pioneered by Eli Whitney, who in 1793 invented the cotton gin, a machine for separating cotton fibres from their seeds. Whitney later introduced the production of interchangeable components for the manufacture of guns. Standardization of screw threads by Sir Joseph Whitworth dates back to 1841. Other instances of early standardization can be found in the dawning age of the railway industry, as the establishment of a standard width between the two rails on the railway track, the manufacture of railway couplings, air brakes and the signaling system called for increasing levels of standardized work. But major impetus to the development of standards came around the turn of the 20th century, when a large number of national standardization organizations were founded, including organizations that are nowadays known as the British Standards Institution (BSI) and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Their purpose was to create sets of rules for the design... </p>
