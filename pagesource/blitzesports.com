And I think a couple of on the team didn't feel like that was correct. But the reason it happened like that was, just because of past experience with Aphro, Jae was usually the back up kind of person to do that, so he was just naturally given that role. And I guess over the split, we didn't really feel like it was being done super well, and we also weren't helping Jae to do his job really well. So we ended up switching our communication roles this week in practice. It's a little bit late, Week 6, but we did switch it a bit, and now we just have Vincent doing those things for us. And I think he's a very consistent person, so it's really nice to have him doing it because he does it.

Or, \"Hey, I didn't feel like this was the right call.\" And we're going through a lot of trial and error with that, and I do think we've improved a lot, especially from the first day where it was like, \"OK, we're making pretty clear mistakes,\" and to where it's like, \"OK, now we're able to get to the late game, to where it's the really important times for macro.\" So I think with a little more time we will be really good on that side of things.","key":"8u9kv","inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"depth":0,"data":{}},{"type":"header-three","text":"What's one of the biggest hurdles people come across when training to be a shotcaller?","key":"8657r","inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"depth":0,"data":{}},{"type":"unstyled","text":"I think the biggest hurdle for a shotcaller is to tell people, \"No.\" And I think that something Aphro is really good at.

We'll do this and will wait for this guy.\" But sometimes you just have to say, \"No, you need to come right now.\" I think a lot of people struggle with that because they want everyone to do what's best for them.

I think the only difference is, in the morning when I wake up, I don&#x27;t mind talking to everyone, and then Vincent&#x27;s just kind of like, &quot;Don&#x27;t talk to me.&quot; And I&#x27;m just like, &quot;OK.&quot; But outside of that, I think me and him are very similar, and it&#x27;s funny to see—I think Bio is the kind of person who adapts to different personalities. So for example, when we&#x27;re scrimming, he can be really serious. And then when I&#x27;m playing duo queue with him, he understands my humor really well, and just says things I think too that I wasn&#x27;t thinking of, or I didn&#x27;t feel like he was that type of person. But I just think it&#x27;s really funny to play with him, and he&#x27;s a really good person overall.</p><h3>You&#x27;ve also said you&#x27;re similar to Aphro. So are Bio and Aphro similar to each other?</h3><p>Yeah, I actually do see a lot of similarities in Aphro and Bio. Like I said, the morning thing, when you wake up and they just look like they hate life, and I&#x27;m just like, &quot;Hey guys.&quot; So yeah, I think that&#x27;s pretty similar about them, and they also—I feel like Bio&#x27;s working on it, but he does have a leadership mentality, and we&#x27;ve kind of forced him to almost do this because we feel like the best kind of person to lead the team is a support. But he does it really well, and so I guess that&#x27;s also very similar in their aspects.</p><h3>Why did you guys decide that having Huhi as the shotcaller wasn&#x27;t the ideal role for him?</h3><p>So pretty much how our communication roles went this split is we just came together as five, and then we were just given roles like, &quot;Here. You&#x27;re doing this, you&#x27;re doing this, you&#x27;re doing this,&quot; and Jae was the primary shotcaller off the bat without anyone else really getting a chance do it. And I think a couple of on the team didn&#x27;t feel like that was correct. But the reason it happened like that was, just because of past experience with Aphro, Jae was usually the back up kind of person to do that, so he was just naturally given that role. And I guess over the split, we didn&#x27;t really feel like it was being done super well, and we also weren&#x27;t helping Jae to do his job really well. So we ended up switching our communication roles this week in practice. It&#x27;s a little bit late, Week 6, but we did switch it a bit, and now we just have Vincent doing those things for us. And I think he&#x27;s a very consistent person, so it&#x27;s really nice to have him doing it because he does it. He makes sure is gets done every game.</p><h3>What does it look like in training when you&#x27;re practicing shotcalling?</h3><p>So when we&#x27;re practicing shotcalling, usually we just take a segment of our postgame review to talk about communication, where it&#x27;s like, &quot;What did you guys think Vincent did good? What do you think Vincent did bad? Or what do you think he needs to improve on?&quot; So he&#x27;s just getting direct criticism after every game like, &quot;Hey, I think you should be more forceful with this call,&quot; or something like that. Or, &quot;Hey, I didn&#x27;t feel like this was the right call.&quot; And we&#x27;re going through a lot of trial and error with that, and I do think we&#x27;ve improved a lot, especially from the first day where it was like, &quot;OK, we&#x27;re making pretty clear mistakes,&quot; and to where it&#x27;s like, &quot;OK, now we&#x27;re able to get to the late game, to where it&#x27;s the really important times for macro.&quot; So I think with a little more time we will be really good on that side of things.</p><h3>What&#x27;s one of the biggest hurdles people come across when training to be a shotcaller?</h3><p>I think the biggest hurdle for a shotcaller is to tell people, &quot;No.&quot; And I think that something Aphro is really good at. So for example, we have to group and do something, but someone else is like, &quot;Hey, I want to push on my wave real quick.&quot; Sometimes the shotcaller wants just, &quot;OK. We&#x27;ll do this and will wait for this guy.&quot; But sometimes you just have to say, &quot;No, you need to come right now.&quot; I think a lot of people struggle with that because they want everyone to do what&#x27;s best for them. But I think that&#x27;s also another aspect that Biofrost has struggled with, but we&#x27;re helping him learn.</p><h3>Looking back on your time with CLG so far, what quality of yours do you think has grown the most since you joined?</h3><p>Qualities that I&#x27;ve grown most, I definitely think... I don&#x27;t know how to say this any other way, but I think when I first join the team, I was a little shit. I don&#x27;t really know how else to say it, but I think I just matured a lot, and I was able to understand how to talk to people more, like other people, and just work with them in general without voicing frustrations to them. And even now not everything is gonna be perfect, but I do think I got a lot better at not just saying the first thing that&#x27;s on my mind, trying to say it in a more nicer way, so I can talk to them without it being emotional. I think that&#x27;s probably the biggest thing I worked on.</p><h3>What helped you become less of a &quot;little shit&quot;?</h3><p>I don&#x27;t really know to be honest. I think it was just a mindset change. I think somewhere around Summer 2016 is where I felt like I was willing to listen to people more, and it wasn&#x27;t just all about whatever I think is right. It was more like, &quot;You know, I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with you, but I&#x27;ll do what you say anyways because it might just better the team.&quot; So I don&#x27;t know, I think it&#x27;s just natural maturing.</p>"},{"data":null,"slug":null,"type":"youtube","show_rss":true,"published":true,"fb_message":null,"fb_publish":false,"author":{"username":null,"name":"Sharon Coone","image_url":"https://d3kjdix9ozghcx.cloudfront.net/entryimages/20170714183402_Screen Shot 2017-07-14 at 11.33.29 AM.png","id":12265,"contributor":false,"bio":"Sharon spent three years as a video game encyclopedia (Editor in Chief) at Twinfinite.

And try to get better, and make Rick Fox happy, I guess.</p><h3>You just wanna make Rick Fox happy?</h3><p>I mean yeah, he&#x27;s really happy that, when he&#x27;s here and when we win, he&#x27;s really happy. So it&#x27;s really good to see that, because Echo Fox didn&#x27;t go well through, so we try to keep getting better, and also it&#x27;s going to be good for me too if I play better.</p><h3>Are you excited for MSI? Would you go?</h3><p>I would be super excited for MSI.</p><h3>What team would you want to be on? Representing a certain region or just trying to do well?</h3><p>I just want to show Echo Fox can do well. Not even NA, just Echo Fox. I don&#x27;t care if other teams go to MSI and do well, because it&#x27;s whatever, it&#x27;s not my team, and Echo Fox will do good if we go to MSI. I&#x27;m pretty sure we can do that.</p>"},{"data":{"entityMap":{},"blocks":[{"type":"header-three","text":"CLG isn't doing well, and some think it's because you left.

He's doing a lot better, and playing more aggressive bottom lanes, as you can see. He played Thresh/Blitz this past weekend and stuff like that, he played Bard the other weekend before that versus CLG, and he's very good at setting me up, in terms of being able to make those kind of plays.

It’s a big shakeup for a non-preseason or midseason change, so let&#x27;s guide you through the new AP build paths, and what each champion should look to buy now.<br/></p><h2>Why AP Items are Getting a Rework:</h2><p>The big goal of Patch 8.4 is to add early item options that will make AP itemization less stale, because right now, most mages have a set 2-3 core item build path regardless of the game: Morellonomicon into Liandry’s for most mages, or Tear into Rod of Ages or Abyssal Mask for the heavy mana users like Ryze or Cassiopeia. </p><p>In theory, with more 1st item options, we can reward more decision making and let people switch builds to fit each situation better.</p><p>The secondary problem we had is that AP items are extremely overloaded. Morellonomicon is a purchase for almost every mage because it grants extremely important Ability Power, Cooldown Reduction and Mana, but on top of it it has a mana restoration passive AND Grievous wounds. Haunting Guise is meant to amplifying damage with its flat penetration, but the burn on Liandry’s is good for consistent damage dealers and against tanks. </p><h3><br/>tl;dr - Too few options and certain items were doing too much and thus becoming too prevalent.</h3><h2><strong>Lost Chapter: early CDR that builds into late CDR</strong></h2><p>Lost Chapter is a bit more expensive but now grants 10% CDR, giving mana-based mages access to the stat a little earlier, which is important especially when behind. <br/>It now builds into three 20% CDR items that have similar stats:</p><ul><li><strong>Scaling: </strong>Archangel Staff</li><li><strong>Catch: </strong>Hextech GLP-800</li><li><strong>Poke:</strong> Luden&#x27;s Echo</li></ul><h2><strong>Luden’s Echo: CDR for weak wave clear</strong></h2><h2></h2><div style=\"clear:both;\"><figure class=\" \"><img src=\"https://d3kjdix9ozghcx.cloudfront.net/entryimages/20180221173959_luden.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-img-width=\"1006\" data-img-height=\"293\"/></figure></div><p>Right off the bat, Luden’s seems to be the most popular first item for most mages.

At level 9, most mages base mana ranges between 650-750 range, which will translate into 20 AP at worst.<br/><br/><strong>This means that a rushed Archangel’s Staff will grant at least 90 Ability Power, without even taking into account tear stacks. <br/><br/></strong>While Archangel’s is supposed to be the scaling item, it’s strong when completed and becomes stronger with scaling which means we might see a lot of non traditional Tear mages start building Archangel’s Staff and picking it over Luden’s Echo, given that the current meta revolves a lot more around scaling, and the shield passive on Seraph&#x27;s is invaluable for extra protection going into the mid and late game stages.<br/></p><div style=\"clear:both;\"><figure class=\" \"><img src=\"https://d3kjdix9ozghcx.cloudfront.net/entryimages/20180220203246_AP-Archangel%20jpeg.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-img-width=\"1358\" data-img-height=\"304\"/></figure></div><h2><strong>Hextech GLP-800: Helping you pick off and catch opponents</strong></h2><h2></h2><div style=\"clear:both;\"><figure class=\" \"><img src=\"https://d3kjdix9ozghcx.cloudfront.net/entryimages/20180221173616_glp.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-img-width=\"1006\" data-img-height=\"293\"/></figure></div><p>Finally there’s Hextech GLP.
