                <p>We're sick of it. It's time to do something, and as educators, one constructive thing we know how to do is to teach people. So, the aim of this course is to help students navigate the bullshit-rich modern environment by identifying bullshit, seeing through it, and combating it with effective analysis and argument.</p>
                                              
                <p>What do we mean, exactly, by <em>bullshit</em> and <em>calling bullshit</em>? As a first approximation:</p>
                    
                <p class="tab"><em>Bullshit</em> involves language, statistical figures, data graphics, and other forms of presentation intended to persuade by impressing and overwhelming a reader or listener, with a blatant disregard for truth and logical coherence. </p>
                
                <p class="tab"><em>Calling bullshit</em> is a performative utterance, a speech act in which one publicly repudiates something objectionable. The scope of targets is broader than bullshit alone. You can call bullshit on bullshit, but you can also call bullshit on lies, treachery, trickery, or injustice. </p>
                
                <p>In this course we will teach you how to spot the former and effectively perform the latter.</p>
                <p>While bullshit may reach its apogee in the political domain, this is not a course on political bullshit. Instead, we will focus on bullshit that comes clad in the trappings of scholarly discourse. Traditionally, such highbrow nonsense has come couched in big words and fancy rhetoric, but more and more we see it presented instead in the guise of big data and fancy algorithms — and these quantitative, statistical, and computational forms of bullshit are those that we will be addressing in the present course.</p>
                
                <p> Of course an advertisement is trying to sell you something, but do you know whether the TED talk you watched last night is also bullshit — and if so, can you explain why? Can you see the problem with the latest <i>New York Times</i> or <i>Washington Post</i> article fawning over some startup's big data analytics? Can you tell when a clinical trial reported in the <i>New England Journal</i> or <i>JAMA</i> is trustworthy, and when it is just a veiled press release for some big pharma company? </p>
                    
                <p><b>Our aim in this course is to teach you how to think critically about the data and models that constitute evidence in the social and natural sciences.</b> </p>
