Whatever the season, something is always happening at UVF to get everyone involved. For the month of February, the main events were the Super Bowl Party, Neon Night event, and Night on the Ice event.<br />
<br />
Sunday, February 4, 2018 was a historic day for Philadelphians as the Eagles won their first Super Bowl in NFL history. At UVF, students joined in on the fun by watching the game together in the Flower Chapel. Fans of both teams came, making a total turnout of over 150 students, all cheering as the chapel lights flashed team colors after every score. Couches and ping pong tables, as well as pizza, wings, and pretzels, were brought in for the party, but the most memorable part of the evening &ndash; aside from the great win and maybe the Tide commercials &ndash; was the fantastic raffle giveaway. Students were handed a ticket on the way in and given the opportunity to earn more tickets by answering Super Bowl trivia throughout the first half. At halftime, the winning ticket was drawn, and one lucky student left with a brand new TV! The party was a real win for students, and everyone had a&nbsp;<em>super&nbsp;</em>time.<br />
<br />
Another great event was the Neon Night event. This is the second time the Student Cabinet has hosted a Neon Night and once again, it was a hit. The Flower Chapel was transformed into a laser tag maze, and prizes were given to the winners of the tournament. More fun awaited in the Anvil as students played video games, board games, enjoyed snacks, and watched a fun movie. The whole building was filled with laughter, and students had a great time playing and getting away from the stress of college life.<br />
<br />
In addition to these events, UVF offers even more fun for students. One way they get together is through off-campus activities like the recent Night on the Ice event&nbsp;at a local rink. Another way to connect is through a&nbsp;little friendly competition, such as in this month's basketball tournament dorm competition, and the upcoming Rookie video contest. Sports, clubs, student-led ministries, and newly-implemented dorm chapels contribute to the atmosphere of togetherness as well. It's no wonder that with so much to offer on this close-knit campus, the UVF community is thriving and continues to grow stronger!<br />

<div>Missions is a big part of the University of Valley Forge (UVF) community. This year, nine teams are heading out to meet needs both locally and abroad. Trip locations include: Russia, Haiti, Hawaii, the Mohawk Reservation in New York, Nicaragua, Japan, Mexico, Spain, and India. Each trip has a different focus on an aspect of missions, but students from all majors will be participating in things like children&rsquo;s ministry, clinics, construction, digital media, and drug rehabilitation.<br />
<br />
At the beginning of the year, approximately 100 students participated in Impact Training Weekend to prepare for mission trips going out this spring break and summer. Teams spent the night together building community by playing games together, preparing for the field by trying exotic foods and working with interpreters, praying for their individual trips, and learning about missions from Pastor Jermel Mayo and a panel of speakers.<br />
<br />
One student shared her experience preparing for the trip with her teammates:&nbsp;"My team and I have been raising money for our mission trip to Haiti this spring break where we will be leading a four-day VBS for the Haitian children. In order to raise money, we have sent out letters to multiple churches, family members, and friends asking for funds. We also sold drinks and snacks during Christmas at the Forge. Our team has been working hard to plan the VBS services by practicing every Sunday for at least two hours. We are currently finalizing the structure and lesson plan for each VBS day. We still have another four weeks until flying off to Haiti, but our team is very excited to be embarking on this incredible journey. We ask for prayers as we continue to raise money for this, but we know that God will provide!"<br />
<br />
In addition to these great teams, the entire student body continues to support missionaries to Ireland and Indonesia along with the local Teen Challenge through tithe, offering, and faith promises. UVF&rsquo;s heart for missions is beating stronger than ever, and students can&rsquo;t wait to see lives changed at home and around the world! &nbsp;</div>
<br />
Please pray for the Valley Forge mission teams and missionaries as they do God's work in the world! If you would like to contribute to our missionaries and teams, follow these links!<br />

Trip locations include: Russia, Haiti, Hawaii, the Mohawk Reservation in New York, Nicaragua, Japan, Mexico, Spain, and India. Each trip has a different focus on an aspect of missions, but students from all majors will be participating in things like children&rsquo;s ministry, clinics, construction, digital media, and drug rehabilitation.<br />
<br />
At the beginning of the year, approximately 100 students participated in Impact Training Weekend to prepare for mission trips going out this spring break and summer. Teams spent the night together building community by playing games together, preparing for the field by trying exotic foods and working with interpreters, praying for their individual trips, and learning about missions from Pastor Jermel Mayo and a panel of speakers.<br />
<br />
One student shared her experience preparing for the trip with her teammates:&nbsp;"My team and I have been raising money for our mission trip to Haiti this spring break where we will be leading a four-day VBS for the Haitian children. In order to raise money, we have sent out letters to multiple churches, family members, and friends asking for funds. We also sold drinks and snacks during Christmas at the Forge. Our team has been working hard to plan the VBS services by practicing every Sunday for at least two hours. We are currently finalizing the structure and lesson plan for each VBS day. We still have another four weeks until flying off to Haiti, but our team is very excited to be embarking on this incredible journey. We ask for prayers as we continue to raise money for this, but we know that God will provide!"<br />
<br />
In addition to these great teams, the entire student body continues to support missionaries to Ireland and Indonesia along with the local Teen Challenge through tithe, offering, and faith promises. UVF&rsquo;s heart for missions is beating stronger than ever, and students can&rsquo;t wait to see lives changed at home and around the world! &nbsp;</div>
<br />
Please pray for the Valley Forge mission teams and missionaries as they do God's work in the world! If you would like to contribute to our missionaries and teams, follow these links!<br />

Whatever the season, something is always happening at UVF to get everyone involved. For the month of February, the main events were the Super Bowl Party, Neon Night event, and Night on the Ice event.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nSunday, February 4, 2018 was a historic day for Philadelphians as the Eagles won their first Super Bowl in NFL history. At UVF, students joined in on the fun by watching the game together in the Flower Chapel. Fans of both teams came, making a total turnout of over 150 students, all cheering as the chapel lights flashed team colors after every score. Couches and ping pong tables, as well as pizza, wings, and pretzels, were brought in for the party, but the most memorable part of the evening \u0026ndash; aside from the great win and maybe the Tide commercials \u0026ndash; was the fantastic raffle giveaway. Students were handed a ticket on the way in and given the opportunity to earn more tickets by answering Super Bowl trivia throughout the first half. At halftime, the winning ticket was drawn, and one lucky student left with a brand new TV! The party was a real win for students, and everyone had a\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003esuper\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003etime.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nAnother great event was the Neon Night event. This is the second time the Student Cabinet has hosted a Neon Night and once again, it was a hit. The Flower Chapel was transformed into a laser tag maze, and prizes were given to the winners of the tournament. More fun awaited in the Anvil as students played video games, board games, enjoyed snacks, and watched a fun movie. The whole building was filled with laughter, and students had a great time playing and getting away from the stress of college life.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nIn addition to these events, UVF offers even more fun for students. One way they get together is through off-campus activities like the recent Night on the Ice event\u0026nbsp;at a local rink. Another way to connect is through a\u0026nbsp;little friendly competition, such as in this month\u0027s basketball tournament dorm competition, and the upcoming Rookie video contest. Sports, clubs, student-led ministries, and newly-implemented dorm chapels contribute to the atmosphere of togetherness as well.

This year, nine teams are heading out to meet needs both locally and abroad. Trip locations include: Russia, Haiti, Hawaii, the Mohawk Reservation in New York, Nicaragua, Japan, Mexico, Spain, and India. Each trip has a different focus on an aspect of missions, but students from all majors will be participating in things like children\u0026rsquo;s ministry, clinics, construction, digital media, and drug rehabilitation.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nAt the beginning of the year, approximately 100 students participated in Impact Training Weekend to prepare for mission trips going out this spring break and summer. Teams spent the night together building community by playing games together, preparing for the field by trying exotic foods and working with interpreters, praying for their individual trips, and learning about missions from Pastor Jermel Mayo and a panel of speakers.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nOne student shared her experience preparing for the trip with her teammates:\u0026nbsp;\"My team and I have been raising money for our mission trip to Haiti this spring break where we will be leading a four-day VBS for the Haitian children. In order to raise money, we have sent out letters to multiple churches, family members, and friends asking for funds. We also sold drinks and snacks during Christmas at the Forge. Our team has been working hard to plan the VBS services by practicing every Sunday for at least two hours. We are currently finalizing the structure and lesson plan for each VBS day. We still have another four weeks until flying off to Haiti, but our team is very excited to be embarking on this incredible journey.

This year, nine teams are heading out to meet needs both locally and abroad. Trip locations include: Russia, Haiti, Hawaii, the Mohawk Reservation in New York, Nicaragua, Japan, Mexico, Spain, and India. Each trip has a different focus on an aspect of missions, but students from all majors will be participating in things like children\u0026rsquo;s ministry, clinics, construction, digital media, and drug rehabilitation.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nAt the beginning of the year, approximately 100 students participated in Impact Training Weekend to prepare for mission trips going out this spring break and summer. Teams spent the night together building community by playing games together, preparing for the field by trying exotic foods and working with interpreters, praying for their individual trips, and learning about missions from Pastor Jermel Mayo and a panel of speakers.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nOne student shared her experience preparing for the trip with her teammates:\u0026nbsp;\"My team and I have been raising money for our mission trip to Haiti this spring break where we will be leading a four-day VBS for the Haitian children. In order to raise money, we have sent out letters to multiple churches, family members, and friends asking for funds. We also sold drinks and snacks during Christmas at the Forge. Our team has been working hard to plan the VBS services by practicing every Sunday for at least two hours. We are currently finalizing the structure and lesson plan for each VBS day. We still have another four weeks until flying off to Haiti, but our team is very excited to be embarking on this incredible journey.
