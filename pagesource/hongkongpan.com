<p>From Paul Theroux to Jan Morris, famous authors from all walks of life have been fascinated by the vibrant city of Hong Kong and have chosen the island as the setting for their successful books. Here are the books that have best captured Hong Kong's in all its colorful and vibrant glory.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">The first one to be mentioned is Jan Morris' book &ldquo;Hong Kong&rdquo; which was published back in 1997. The author explores Hong Kong's complex past, present and future in 1997, during the last days Hong Kong was under the British rule. In 1984, the British and Chinese governments signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration which stated that the sovereignty of Hong Kong should enjoy a &ldquo;high degree of autonomy&rdquo; under the &ldquo;One Country, Two Systems&rdquo; principle.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3"><strong>One of the famous passages of the book reads as follows:</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">&ldquo;It is more than a city actually, being an archipelago of some 235 rocks and islands attendant upon a squat mountainous peninsula. Humped or supine, silent in the haze, to the south and west the islands seem to lie bewitched along the dim blue coast of China, and to the north a line of mainland hills stands like a rampart - the hills of Kowloon, or Nine Dragons. With luck the sea, when the mist disperses, will be a tremendous emerald green, and if one looks with a sufficiently selective eye it is easy enough to imagine the place as it was when it first entered world history, 150 years ago.&rdquo;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Another honorable mention is Alice Greenway's White Ghost Girls, published in 2006. This is a powerful and haunting novel of love and loss that was long-listed for the Orange Prize. The book tells the story of Frankie and Kate, two American sisters living in a foreign land in a chaotic time.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">&ldquo;Out in the harbor, at the end of summer, fishermen feed the hungry ghosts. They float paper boats shaped like junks and steamships. One is double-prowed like the cross-harbor Star Ferry which plies its way back and forth between Hong Kong (island) and Kowloon, never having to turn around. The fishermen load each tiny paper boat with some tea leaves, a drop of cooking oil, a spoonful of rice, a splash of petrol, before setting it afloat. Boats for the lost at sea, for the drowned. They hire musicians to clang cymbals. Children throw burning spirit money into the waves.&rdquo;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">An engrossing and detailed historical novel is The Piano Teacher by Janice Y K Lee, published in 2009. The novel tells a love story set in Hong Kong in the 1940s and 1950s. A married woman is hired by a rich family to give piano lessons and ends up having a love affair with the driver who had a tragic love story of his own. The novel moves fluidly between one love story and the other. The character of Trudy was loosely based on American novelist and journalist Emily Hahn.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8"><strong>Here is an extract from the novel:</strong></div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph9">&ldquo;To her surprise, she didn't detest Hong Kong, as her mother told her she would - she found the streets busy and distracting, so very different from Croydon, and filled with people and shops and goods she had never seen before. She liked to sample the local bakery goods, the pineapple buns, and yellow egg tarts, and sometimes wondered outside Central, where she would quickly find herself in unfamiliar surroundings, where she might be the only non-Chinese around. The fruit stalls were heaped with not only oranges and bananas, still luxuries in post-war England, but spiky, strange-looking fruits she came to try and like: starfruit, durian, lychee.&rdquo;</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>Tradition meets modernity and the East blends with the West all year in Hong Kong throughout its festivals. From the officially supported Mega Events Fund and &ldquo;M&rdquo; Mark Events to ancient and quirky local festivals, there's something for everyone in this vibrant city.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2"><strong>Chinese New Year</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">Celebrations start with the Chinese New Year, Hong Kong's most celebrated festival. A frenzy of neon and noise, skyscrapers on both sides of the harbor are lit up while fireworks explode over the harbor. This event takes place three days from the first day of the first moon, usually late January or early February.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4"><strong>Spring Lantern (Yuen Siu)</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Known as the Chinese Valentine's Day, Spring Lantern (Yuen Siu) Festival marks the end of the traditional Lunar New Year celebrations. The reason why Cupid makes his appearance on this festival is that the event is characterized by canoodling couples who take to the parks under the gentle glow of lanterns. This festival takes place on the 23rd of the 3rd moon (April).</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6"><strong>Cheung Chau Bun Festival </strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">Another remarkable event is the Cheung Chau Bun Festival. Young men used to climb up 8m (26ft) towers covered in buns. This practice, however, was banned in the 1970s as some men would fall off and injure themselves. The event was revived in a tamer form in 2005. The festival takes place on the 6th day of the 4th moon (May).</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8"><strong>Ching Ming Festival</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">Also known as the grave-sweeping festival, ching ming means &ldquo;clear and bright.&rdquo; Chinese families visit the graves of their ancestors to clear them of any weeds and wilted flowers. It is a widespread practice to light incense and burn paper money. This event takes place on the first week of April.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10"><strong>Dragon Boat (Tuen Ng) Festival</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph11">During the Dragon Boat (Tuen Ng) Festival, drums thunder and paddles churn the waters of Hong Kong as garish craft vie for the top prize. The festival was founded to commemorate Qu Yuan, a 3rd-century poet-statesman who drowned himself to protest against corrupt rulers. The festival takes place on the 5th day of the 5th moon (early June) on various venues.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph12"><strong>Hungry Ghost (Yue Laan) Festival</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph13">From the 14th day of the seventh moon, Chinese believe the gates of Hell are    kicked open and the undead run free on Earth for a whole month. During that time, countless &ldquo;Hell money&rdquo; is burned on pyres along with various hillsides. Consequently, this is not a good time for hiking. The festival takes place across various locations in July.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph14"><strong>Mid-Autumn Festival</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph15">This is an unmissable festival in Hong Kong as it is the most picturesque. Families flock to the country parks to burn candles and feast on yolk-centered moon-cakes. Modernity has also influenced this festival, as nowadays the intricate paper lanterns have increasingly been supplanted by glowing, blow-up Hello Kitty, Doraemon and Pok&eacute;mon dolls. This event takes place on the 15th night of the 8th moon (August). A good spot to watch this festival is Victoria Park.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph16"><strong>Chung Yeung Festival</strong></div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph17">This event requires hiking as it honors a Han Dynasty scholar who took his family up a hill and came back to find the rest of his village murdered. The event takes place on the 9th evening of the 9th moon (usually mid-to late October on any hilltop.</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>Hong Kong is a great city that has been mentioned in books by authors from different nationalities. Here are some of the books where Hong Kong features:</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">&ldquo;The Mologai. The sun shines less in the Mologai, but heat gathers there in the shade and smoke. Steep cramped dwellings, shops oldish. Oddly, smoke pervading the whole area. The streets cling to contours. You clamber up steps from one narrow alleyway to the next, among the stalls. It's an antique hunter's paradise - or rather purgatory, because the promise of heaven takes time to realize.&rdquo;  Jonathan Gash, Jade Woman</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">&ldquo;There were streets, narrow and crowded with people and vehicles. Above them flashed neon lights and blinking billboards of every colour, shape and size. Some ran up the sides of buildings, others blinked on and off in store windows. In the space above the sidewalk, higher than a double-decker bus, hung flashing neon signs in bright pink, yellow, read, blue, orange, green and white. Yes, if white could be whiter than white, it was when it was in neon, Hong Mei thought. She knew Nathan Road in Kowloon was famous for its neon lights.&rdquo;  B.L. Sauder, Year of the Golden Dragon</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">&ldquo;It's not rocket science. Hong Kong has 95% tax compliance, because it's code is only 4 pages long with a 15% flat tax.&rdquo;  Ziad K. Abdelnour, Economic Warfare: Secrets of Wealth Creation in the Age of Welfare Politics</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">&ldquo;This is Unique !! Shopping malls working with one side of our needs, material satisfaction but here @ K11 there is a huge effort and initiative to bring emotional needs of human, our spiritual satisfaction. K11 doing this with bringing Art and Nature in to the material shopping experience. It is not only satisfying physical needs and material but also our soul. Art itself is biggest teacher and Nature is biggest artist.&rdquo;  Baris Gencel</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">"For all its reputation for conservatism, cricket in its history has demonstrated a remarkable capacity for innovation. What game has survived subjection to such extraordinary manipulations, having been prolonged to 10 days (in Durban 70 years ago), truncated to as few as 60 balls (in Hong Kong every year), and remained recognisable in each instance?&rdquo;  Gideon Haigh</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph1">Caught up between History and modernity, Hong Kong offers extreme contrasts to the eyes of avid travelers. While the city prides itself in its modern skyscrapers, Hong Kong also treasures its historical temples.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">An unmissable attraction in Hong Kong is watching the sunset from <a target='_blank' href="http://www.thepeak.com.hk" target="_blank">Victoria Peak</a>, the highest region on the island. In colonial times, the area was an exclusive neighborhood for the rich to come and escape the heat and smog of the city in a cooler temperate. Despite the invention of the air conditioner, nowadays the view keeps attracting both tourists and locals to this spot. People gather in the area to enjoy the last glimpse of the day before the sky is painted by an array of pinks and oranges.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">A Grade 1 historical building and temple, <a target='_blank' href="http://www.heritage.gov.hk/en/buildings/lopan.htm" target="_blank">Lo Pan Temple</a>, can be found at the western end of Hong Kong Island. This is the only temple dedicated to the patron saint of Chinese builders and carpenters in Hong Kong. Although it is a square and mainly grey building surrounded by other plain properties, it is attractively decorated with gold Chinese symbols of poems praising Lo Pan's contribution to architecture above the entrance. On the outside, ornate red decoration on the roof makes the temple stand out; inside, murals bring the walls to life.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">Right in the middle of the city, there's <a target='_blank' href="http://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/see-do/culture-heritage/chinese-temples/chi-lin-nunnery-and-nan-lian-garden.jsp" target="_blank">Nan Lian Park</a> in Diamond Hill. Built in the classical style of Tang Dynasty, this oasis boasts traditional pagoda buildings overlooking large lakes, rocky waterfalls and landscaped gardens dotted with tree. The scenery creates a peaceful getaway from the madness of the city. Locals and tourists alike come here to relax while they listen to tricking water.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">The Buddhist temple of Sik Sik Yuen Wong Tai Sin is brightly decorated on the outside with colorful symbols. Its name translate into &lsquo;make every wish come true' which probably has something to do with its popularity, although it remains an important religious place. Although the temple was built to commemorate Wong Tai Sin - a famous monk from the 4th century, it's actually home to three religions: Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism. The influence of feng shui is also palpable in the design of the building, even in the colorful gardens.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph6">After relaxing at the park and indulging your curiosity at the temples, it might be time for an adventure and Dragon's Back hike is just what you need. The hike is an incredible way to see great views with the advantage of fresh air. The trail resembles the shape of a dragon's back bone, hence the name, and it leads walkers through hill tops. Some of the great views you will spot are those of Shek O, Tai Long Wan, Stanely, Tai Tan and the South Chine Sea.</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>Hong Kong and American actor, <a target='_blank' href="https://www.facebook.com/BruceLee" target="_blank">Bruce Lee</a> was also a martial artist, philosopher, filmmaker and founder of the martial art Jeet Kune Do. A pop culture icon of the 20th century, Lee is widely considered by commentators, critics, media and other martial artists to be one of the most influential martial artists of all time. His influence was such that he is often credited with helping to change the way Asians were depicted in Hollywood.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">Born in Chinatown, San Francisco, to parents from Hong Kong, Lee was raised in Kowloon with his family until his late teens. Although his mother was a Cantonese opera star - Lee Hoi-Chuen - it was his father who introduced him to the film industry and appeared in several films as a child actor.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">His Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films elevated the traditional Hong Kong martial arts film to a new level of popularity and acclaim, causing a surge of interest in Chinese martial arts in the West in the 1970s. The direction and tone of his films changed and influenced martial arts and martial arts films in the US, Hong Kong and the rest of the world.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">He is noted for the films The Big Boss, Fist of Fury, Way of the Dragon, Enter the Dragon and The Game of Death. His portrayal of Chinese nationalism in his films won him worldwide popularity, particularly among the Chinese.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5"><strong>Here are some of his most famous quotes:</strong></div>
<ul style='list-style-type:square;margin-left: 24px; margin-right: 0px;'>
    <li>&ldquo;Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;I'm not in this world to live up to your expectations and you're not in this world to live up to mine.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;I fear not the man who has practice 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;A wise man can learn more from a foolish question than a fool can learn from a wise answer.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Adapt what is useful, reject what is useless, and ad what is specifically your own.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Knowing is not enough, we must apply. Willing is not enough, we must do.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;If you love life, don't waste time, for time is what life is made up of.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we must do.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Defeat is a state of mind; no one is ever defeated until defeat has been accepted as a reality.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;For it is easy to criticize and break down the spirit of others, but to know yourself takes a lifetime.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;The past is no more; the future not yet. Nothing exists except the here and now. Our grand business is not to see what lies dimly at a distance, but to do what lies clearly at our hands.&rdquo;</li>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>From dim sum to shark fin soup, dishes in Hong Kong suit every palate. You are equally likely to find the most delectable food either at a high-end restaurant or at a street stall.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">Hong Kong's most popular food is, naturally, Cantonese, consisting of fast cooking at very high temperatures with abundant tiny chopped vegetables and, of course, seafood.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">The well-known dim sum snack is a steamed dough dumpling looking snack filled with meat or vegetables. The best delicacy, however, is shark's fin soup, which also happens to be one of the most expensive meals.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">From local foods to world cuisine, there are an overwhelming eateries in the buzzing area of Hong Island. If you are looking for Hong Kong style food, Faj Seafood Hotpot is the place to eat at. Like its name indicates, the place also serves hot pots and, naturally, Chinese food. Its signature dishes include steamed crabs and hot and spicy Szechuan Broth. The beef is also recommended here. If you prefer to have a European meal at a luxurious environment, opt for Amber, a French restaurant in Central.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Although the former industrial neighborhood of Kowloon is renown for its international cuisine, it specializes in Asian foods such as Indian and Cantonese. Most of Kowloon's eateries are welcoming, economical and family-run. If you are looking to try an authentic curry, head to Bombay Dreams which seres southern and northern Indian dishes. If you'd rather try a local dish, the floating restaurant of Jumbo Kingdom serves delectable Cantonese dishes, particularly seafood such as shark fin and lobster soup. You can find them on <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="https://www.openrice.com/en/hongkong"><strong>Open rice</strong></a>.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">While Kowloon boasts international dishes, the restaurants in the islands of the New Territories tend to stick to local cuisine, making them an ideal place to eat the local and traditional delicacies that are often served in lovely wooden shacks. Head to <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g294217-d786794-Reviews-Tai_Wing_Wah_Restaurant-Hong_Kong.html">Tai Wing Wah</a> for real traditional recipes, including dim sum and steamed shredded taro with pork.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">Lantau Island - one of Hong Kong's largest islands - offers a variety of attractions, ranging from grand vistas, amusement parks to quiet beaches and historic villages. Although the island is not able to compete with mega-metropolis Hong Kong when it comes to good, Lantau offers quite a few good dining venues that suit most people's budget. From the cheap eateries to the more high-end restaurants at Discovery Bay, there's a good range to choose from. Although the island does not offer as many options as the mainland does, visitors can enjoy countless types of cuisine, ranging from Cantonese to other regional Chinese dishes to Italian, Turkish, Mediterranean, South African and English. For a casual bite such as sushi and tempura, Kiraku Tei is the place to go. Wash down the scrumptious bites with Japanese sake and beer. Hang out at the Stoep which is right on the beach for Mediterranean food. Indulge yourself in mixed grills and ostrich steak with great views and a family friendly atmosphere.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph8">If you want to dine in style, head to Victoria Harbour, spectacularly lit up at night by the Symphony of Light Show. Known for its upmarket hotels and restaurants that are inside of them, the area is a great place to dine with amazing views over the natural harbor. The Peninsular Hotel does a fantastic afternoon tea in the Lobby in a colonial style with quaint sandwiches and charming cakes.</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">Hong Kong's new eatery is the first overseas venture for a concept that has already proved a hit in Japan.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">The franchise is inspired by popular Finnish stories that tell the adventures of a family of white hippo-like characters and their friends. Although the <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="https://www.moomin.com/"><strong>Moomins</strong></a> was first published in Finland back in 1945, it didn't receive global attention until the release of its television series in the 1990s.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">The first Moomin Cafe opened in Tokyo in 2003. Since then, three more have opened and six Moomin-themed coffee stands. The timing of the opening of the Hong Kong Moomin Cafe couldn't be better, it coincides with the 100th anniversary of the birth of Moomin creator, Tove Jansson.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">Although Japan's original Moomin Cafe has been operating for over a decade, its popularity only exploded earlier this year after its &ldquo;anti-loneliness&rdquo; concept went viral.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">To save its customers from the loneliness of solo dining, a plush Moomin character is brought over to the table as dining companion. &ldquo;I thought if people can stay and sit with Moomin characters like Moominmamma and Moominpappa (parents in the Moomin family), it'd be more interesting,&rdquo; says Mickey Kera, who was the one who came up with the cafe concept.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8">However, Hong Kong's single diners may have to struggle to find an adorable meal buddy. &ldquo;Unlike Japan's anti-loneliness cafes, Moomin characters will be placed at various tables and joining a Moomin character will be up to luck,&rdquo; says cafe spokeswoman Cindy Wu.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">Wu also said that the Hong Kong location features three additional characters not found in the Japanese outlets: Hattifatteners, Little My and Snufkin.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10">Moomin Cafe may have originated in Japan, but the outlet tries to reflect Finnish lifestyle and cuisine. The Tsim Tsa Tsui venue is designed to look like a traditional Finnish house, with photographs of Finland and hand drawn artwork of Moomins.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph11">&ldquo;I love the venison soup stew, salmon milk soup and Jansson's temptation (baked potato with caramelized onion gratin), which are traditional Nordic dishes,&rdquo; says Kera.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph12">&ldquo;I really want to introduce <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Moomin">Moomin</a> and Finnish lifestyle to Hong Kong people.&rdquo; The cafe also offers Finnish traditional bread - Piirakka - and Scandinavian salad with pickled herring, as well as a Nordic dish of salmon with goat cheese and basil.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph13">The new cafe in Hong Kong also features certain dishes that are not available in Japan. For instance, the Moomin House Pancakes are exclusive to the Hong Kong location. This dish consists of an impressive stack drizzled with cream and accompanied by a three-story ceramic Moomin house containing custard pudding, chocolate mousse and mango jelly.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph14">For those diners who wish to take some of the Moomin house home, they can  order the Souvenir Mango Cup Pudding so they can take the mug used to serve the dessert. Moomin-shaped past is also available at the souvenir store.</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>One of the world's most significant financial centers, Hong Kong is renowned for its skyline, with a high density of skyscrapers. Modern, vibrant and cosmopolitan as this Chinese region may be, there's more to Hong Kong that meets the eye. Here are some interesting facts you probably didn't know about Hong Kong.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">Although Hong Kong is famous for its towering skyscrapers, 40 percent of the territory is actually country and nature reserve. Hiking the green trails, in fact, is a favorite weekend-getaway pastime for locals.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">It is general knowledge that Hong Kong means &ldquo;fragrant harbor&rdquo; in Chinese. Historians suggest the name is given due to its former export of fragrant incense. What most people don't know, however, is that when you utter the word &ldquo;Kowloon&rdquo; it means &ldquo;nine dragons.&rdquo; According to Folklore, when a young emperor observed the area's eight hills, he named the land &ldquo;eight dragons,&rdquo; until his servant pointed out that the emperor should be considered a dragon too, therefore nine. Kow sounds like &ldquo;gau&rdquo; or nine in Cantonese, and Loon is like &ldquo;lung&rdquo; or dragon.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">Hong Kong is an autonomous territory and its official name is longer than most names: &ldquo;Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China.&rdquo;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Although most people are familiar with Hong Kong's skyline, not everybody is aware that Hong Kong has the maximum number of skyscrapers (buildings with more than 14 floors) in the whole world. With over 1200 skyscrapers, HK quadruples NYC's tall buildings.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">But these heights don't come without luxury. It is a fact that Hong Kong has more <a target='_blank' href="https://www.rolls-roycemotorcars.com" target="_blank"><strong>Rolls Royce</strong></a>'s per capita than anywhere else in the world.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">Hong Kong keeps breaking records with its bridge Tsing Ma, the longest road and rail suspension bridge in the world with a span of 1,377 meters, surpassing Golden Gate Bridge by almost 100 meters.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8">Hong Kong is also home to two legends of World cinema, Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan, the kings of Kung Fu and Martial arts.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">If you ever happen to visit Hong Kong, you should try the Ngong Ping 360, a 25 minute cable ride covering a distance of 3.5 miles. It offers stunning panoramic views of Hong Kong and it is one of the longest bi-cable aerial rides in Asia connecting Tung Chung to Ngong Ping.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10">While you are in Hong Kong, don't miss out on the watching &ldquo;A Symphony of Lights,&rdquo; the world's largest permanent light and sound show according to Guinness World Records. This daily light and sound show is organized by <a target='_blank' href="http://www.discoverhongkong.com" target="_blank"><strong>Hong Kong Tourism Board</strong></a> and it lasts for around 14 minutes. With searchlights and lasers streaming through 47 skyscrapers on both sides of Victoria harbor, it is a must-see for every tourist.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph11">Although this fact is not as surprising as the others, it is still notable to mention: with a population of over 7 million in a small land mass, Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated cities int he world.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph12">Great population is also coupled with great intelligence and Honkongers are intelligent indeed with the highest IQ average in the world at 107.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph13">Although the region is highly populated, traffic jams are not an issue as HK is one of the least car dependent cities and 90 percent of all trips are taken on public transport. That amounts to the impressive amount of over five million passengers daily.</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>Feng Shui is a Chinese philosophical system of harmonizing everyone with the surrounding environment. This practice discusses architecture in metaphoric terms of &ldquo;invisible forces&rdquo; that bind the universe, earth and humanity together, known as qi.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">An ancient Chinese system of summoning good luck, feng shui - literally wind and water - is a vital part of <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="http://www.discoverhongkong.com"><strong>Hong Kong</strong></a> life and this is clear in the design of its shopping malls, office towers and homes. They all draw on feng shui principles in an attempt to create prosperity. Feng shui also affects people's lives as individuals consult feng shui masters to decide on the best date to get married, give birth or move house.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">Here are some of Hong Kong's spots with the best feng shui.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">Some of the city's best feng shui can be found in <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="http://www.timessquare.com.hk/"><strong>Times Square</strong></a>, the crowded, traffic-clogged heart of Hong Kong shopping district Causeway Bay. It's hard to believe that this buzzing seemingly chaotic area could have such a great feng shui, but you just have to imagine the towering skyscrapers are mountains and the endless procession of cars, taxis and delivery trucks a meandering river and it all begins to make sense.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Causeway Bay draws from the so-called &ldquo;feng shui meridian&rdquo; between four peaks and it's built atop two &ldquo;dragon pulses&rdquo; that flow into Hong Kong in the shape of mountain ranges.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">Accordingly, it is this lucky harmony the one that attracts the masses of shoppers that make the place so profitable for retailers and landlords.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">If you are not bothered by crowds and noise, Causeway Bay is also said to be a lucky to place to call home.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8">Another place blessed with the luck that feng shui brings is the <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="https://www.hsbc.com.hk/"><strong>HSBC</strong></a> Building in downtown Hong Kong. At the entrance of the bank, two bronze lions stand guard protecting the money within. Some locals like to stroke their paws and noses in a hope to get some of its good feng shui fortune. Accordingly, the bank harnesses energy from the five mountains nearby which benefit it and the surrounding buildings.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">On the contrary, a short walk away at the IFC or <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="http://ifc.com.hk"><strong>International Finance Center</strong></a> - Hong Kong island's tallest building - suffers from a different fate. Built on reclaimed land that interrupts the flow of water in the harbor, the building's &ldquo;unkind energy&rdquo; leads to grievances for the family that built it. The three Kwok brothers behind property developer Sun Hung Kai became embroiled in a years-long family feud and the eldest has even been indicted on misconduct charges in a corruption case that had a strong effect on the city.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph10">Another case of bad fortune brought by not respecting the principles of feng shui is embodied in Tamar, the striking Hong Kong government headquarters. Tamar was the focus of massive pro-democracy protests that gripped the city a few years ago. In fact, the government has faced difficulties ever since it moved to the new building in 2011. According to feng shui masters, this is not a coincidence since, like the IFC, the building is sited on reclaimed land and radiates &ldquo;bad energy.&rdquo;</div>
