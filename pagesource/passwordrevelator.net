<p>Because data protection is essential to everyone, creating a <a href="https://www.passwordrevelator.net/en/passfinder.php">Facebook password</a> does not have to be done in few minutes as it can be easily hacked. When registering on a website, the dilemma is always the same: should I choose a secure Twitter password, difficult to remember or the easy way, at my own risk? Unfortunately, users often still look for the second solution, with "stars" of the password like 123456 or "password". You should know that to avoid hacks, a sufficiently long Gmail password should have the capacity of hackers to hack a password depends first on its length. The software they use automatically tests all possible combinations. Each additional character significantly increases the time it takes to <strong><a href="https://www.passwordrevelator.net/en/passdecryptor.php">"crack" an Instagram password</a></strong>. A string of eight to twelve characters is a good compromise between security and ease of memorization. A password using a variety of characters: hacker software is also programmed to test all dictionary words, a large number of first names, and of course all calendar dates (forget your grandmother's birthday). It is therefore necessary to use a variety of characters such as uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and various punctuation characters... A unique Outlook password: Each web site/subscription used by the user must have a different access key. This avoids putting all of his eggs in one basket.</p>
<p>A WiFi password is not created directly, but must be derived from a phrase that ensures a certain level of complexity while remaining memorable. For example, retain the first letter(s) of each word composing a sentence. Then, each one has to bring his personal touch by incorporating a few capital letters (one letter out of two, or of three for example), and numbers (to replace some letter by figures whose typography is neighbor is very effective). Example: Let's use the following sentence: "The eye sees nothing if the mind is distracted": By choosing to use the first letter of each word, a capital letter every two letters, and replacements of the O and E by 0 and 3, we obtain: 0nVrSl'33D. Such a Yahoo password would take about 500 million years to be decrypted by a standard computer. The use of phonetics. When pronouncing a sentence, each sound will generate one of the characters of the Facebook password. Naturally, not all sentences are suitable, but once the choice is made, the memorization will be easy. Example: Based on the sentence "I bought three eggs and two comics this morning." Always with a capital letter every two letters, get: gHt3E98BdCeMPT1. Use a common structure to manage a variety of Facebook passwords. It is possible to create a common core, complete with a second part specific to each service (Facebook, Twitter etc.).</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://www.passwordrevelator.net/images/hack-facebook-account.jpg" alt="hack facebook"></p>
<p>Example of common trunk (fixed): the title of his favorite film. Example of second part (variable): the name of his favorite singer. Example: If you like "Star Wars" and your favorite singer is Michael Jackson, the password will be (always with a capital letter for two letters and replacing the E with a 3): LaGuD33t-MiJa. We voluntarily took the first two letters of each word in order to arrive at a sufficient length. Method 4: Choose a "classic" password, then shift each letter of a key to the right. Example: starting with the first name James, we get (always with a capital letter for two letters) KOZ, EUmZiNE. Once the Instagram password has been chosen, do not hesitate to go and test it on a password verifier that informs of its security level and gives an estimate of the time needed to hack it. You will then quickly perceive the weakness of many combinations that you consider inviolable. Once created, the Facebook password must be protected in order to not get hacked. To do this, avoid keeping it in a computer file that malicious souls will take care to analyze. Physical preservation is also to be avoided. We forget the post-it placed under the computer screen! They allow the access codes of all the sites used to be stored, in the same database, accessible by a single password. You will have the opportunity to create very safe combinations, without having to retain them.</p>
<p>While debates about privacy on the Internet generally concern the giants of the web and the carelessness of young users, it is one thing that must not be forgotten: haking. And as in real life with a burglary, you usually do not think about it enough before you are concerned. Yet it is mathematical: the more we store information online on Facebook, Instagram... the more we use different services and supports, and the more vulnerable we are. More than 15000 web attacks were recorded by computers security companies. Even if these figures come from a company that lives in security (and thus insecurity) IT, they deserve to be taken into GMail account. Especially as our data are more and more personal and critical (social networks). So what to do? If you ask a specialist, the first answer might be: PEBKAC? The acronym of "Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair", in the language of not IT expert: the problem lies between the keyboard and the chair. Still not understood? The problem often comes from the user, not the tool. Preventing rather than curing. This is not a phrase you like to hear, but there is often a background of truth behind it. Because the first thing you can do to avoid Twitter stolen data is to use computer tools with caution. And learn to master them. While you have the best antivirus, it will eventually get overtaken if you do not take your precautions. Thus, the basic principles, such as not visiting unknown sites and little referenced without protection, not to click on a link without knowing what it is, or to update its computer and its antivirus are the first to respect. In the same vein, never respond to strange and unlikely e-mail strings, never give your password to anyone (person) or never leave your session open on a public computer. The targets of hackers are often people who do not respect these few rules. However, even with these basic precautions, there is always a risk. There are a few tips to improve the <a href="https://www.passwordrevelator.net/en/passfinder.php"><strong>security of your WiFi</strong></a> data online.</p>

<p>Internet users spend more time on Facebook, communicating sensitive and valuable personal information, and hackers have found the vein. The Instagram social networks themselves and their users to take more measures to protect themselves from organized crime on the Internet. The progression of attacks by hackers and other "spammers" aimed at social sites like Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, has reached a "worrying" level, according to the computer security company. There are different types of <a href="https://www.passwordrevelator.net/en/passrecovery.php"><strong>hacking via Twitter networks</strong></a>. First the spam that arrives on your Facebook or Twitter accounts. Social networks are quite well protected against this type of piracy, because to be able to send a spam, the hacker must be 'friend' of the victim. Very visible, this type of attack is used by computer security companies to communicate on the subject, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. Then there are the more subtle false ads, which return directly to malicious sites, whose code allows to <a href="https://www.passwordrevelator.net/en/passbreaker.php"><strong>hack the GMail password</strong></a> of the victim. Finally, there are also fake Facebook groups, which offers a link to a page of "phishing", by which an uninformed user, believing to address a site of trust, will enter his personal data. Your personal data are then sold between 10 and 15 dollars. The data of the user of Facebook or Yahoo, once recovered, can be used directly by the hacker, or resold between 10 and 15 dollars on a specialized forum 30 seconds later. With a login (password) and an email address, it is easy for him to get more information about his victim. According to an analysis carried out, more than half of Internet users (56%) use only one password on all the sites on which they are registered. The hacker can therefore peel off the mails from his victim, in order to obtain additional information (physical address, Facebook data, pictures, phones, etc.) and then steal it. A number of databanks are now introducing physical security systems, with the creation of Facebook passwords generated for a single use, but overall it is difficult to ensure that the personal data provided by social network not used against them by a malicious user. People have to understand that we must not say everything about the Internet.</p>

<p>With more and more professional hackers, the threat increases in both quantity and quality. The figure makes you dizzy: 2 million viruses are in circulation every day. The phenomenon of "ransomware" as WannaCry illustrated the new danger that falls on our computers as our smartphones. We must add the good old phishing by e-mail. However, just a few precautions to avoid the inconvenience of losing his data, his memories of holidays or access to his accounts on social networks. Here are the "must-do" to ensure a minimum of cybersecurity on PC, Mac and smartphones.</p>

<p>The e-mail box is always the first vector of infection. Reminder sting: Do not open an attachment or link sent by an unknown address even if the email looks like an official email such as Tax or Social Security. It is also necessary to renew the passwords every 6 months by avoiding easy to find information by cross-checking your public profiles such as birthdates or landline numbers.</p>

<p>In the same logic, it is necessary in absolute terms not to trust any free wi-fi network. The great innovation of hackers is to create fake wireless Internet networks to suck your passwords or bank details but also access your mailboxes.</p>

<p>With democratized cloud solutions (iCloud, Google Drive...), it's easy to save your files online. The most fearful about their personal data will opt for an external hard drive disconnected from the web. Be careful not to make simple copies because ransomware like Wannacry can encrypt and block them. It must go through a software backups complete often free.</p>

<p>Doped with artificial intelligence, malware and other viruses learn to get around antivirus sometimes faster than they are updated. This is why comprehensive protection solutions exist with a dozen technological layers: firewalls, connection filters, e-mail filtering... It will take a little investment to avoid further problems.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://www.passwordrevelator.net/images/SS7.jpg" alt="SS7 hacker"></p>

<p>A technology expert that is working with us has managed to <strong>hack a Facebook account</strong> thanks to the former phone number of its owner. Facebook and Instagram encourages its users to fill in their phone number to increase the security of their account. What if it actually opens the door for pirates? Thanks to an old phone number reassigned to a new person, hackers could access the Facebook account of users who linked this number to their account, according to a technology expert.</p>

<h2><strong>A simple SMS to hack an account</strong></h2>
<p>The social network allows any user to recover his forgotten password by receiving a sms containing a code to enter to be able to access his account again. A handy system when you have a memory hole. But according to our hacker expert, it would also allow hackers to access users' personal data.</p>

<p>The danger? The reassigned phone numbers. He simply did a search on the social network by searching for the user who associated this number to his account and then asked for a forgotten password. He then followed the protocol that allowed him to access the account of his victim.</p>

<p>A hacking technique potentially very profitable. With this technique, all in all simple enough, the expert ensures that pirates could earn a lot of money.</p>

<p>Two-factor authentication has become essential over the years to secure online accounts that contain more and more personal data. Unsurprisingly, many online services offer it to their users. If it is advisable to activate it to be able to sleep on both ears, it should not be too much for it. Security researchers have shown how they can appropriate any online account by <strong>hacking this protection mechanism</strong>.</p>

<p>The process is known; to enable two-step verification, the user must provide a phone number in addition to the username and password already entered when creating a Gmail account, for example. Once this number is verified, the user can activate SMS two-factor authentication on said account. The measure prevents an attacker who has the username and password of the account from accessing the account from his workstation. Indeed, past the first curtain of protection (the couple username and password), the cybercriminal must provide a code sent by the online service on the phone number associated with the account.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://www.passwordrevelator.net/images/hack_key.jpeg" alt="Hack Key"></p>

<p>The measure is also useful to "recover" his account in the case of loss of details of the first shield. Most online services then offer an SMS account recovery procedure. (Concretely, it is question that the online service sends text information recovery account to the number linked to the latter.) This state of affairs assumes that a third party who knows the phone number linked to the account can to mingle with the distance. How? By exploiting the flaws of the SS7 protocol used for signaling on telecommunication networks.</p>

<h2><strong>You can take possession of a third-party GMail account and then Facebook!</strong></h2>
The SS7 infrastructure is in principle only accessible to telecommunications companies. But cybercriminals can access them via platforms on the dark web. This state of affairs is shifting the problem of cybercriminals to telecom operators.</p>
