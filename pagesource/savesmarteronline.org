   <p>We investigate how safe you really are on public wifi. 


 
Public WiFi is a fantastic thing, the freedom you feel of using your laptop in a coffee shop is a new age delight, But just how safe is connecting to these free open networks? What are the dangers which are waiting to compremise your personal details? And How can you stay safe and protected?

According to a Nielsen/Harris poll in March 2014, over 66% of U.S adults say they have used public WiFi with over a quarter of those admitting to checking a bank account whilst on an open, unprotected internet connection. It can seem completely harmless as the dangers aren't visible whatsoever, but they are certainly real...

This is how malware can access your personal data. 




Malware, short for Malicious Software, has been wreaking havoc on computers and networks for decades. Since the first example was found in the early 70s, the numbers showing their growth are worryingly impressive: it really took until around 2005 for it to take off, but at that point there were thousands of new examples being found every day on the internet. In 2012, AV-TEST claims malware hit the 100,000,000 mark, which almost doubled in the next year alone. In 2015, the number topped half a billion different cases, with more than 1 million new ones found daily.
