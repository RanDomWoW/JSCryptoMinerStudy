Case in point: Trump is said to be on the brink of appointing John Bolton as deputy secretary of state. He is arguably the man most responsible for hiding the truth about Iraq&#8217;s nonexistent WMDs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Bush administration, with Bolton as undersecretary of state for arms control, arrived in Washington, D.C., in 2001 with the goal of invading Iraq. They weren&#8217;t motivated by whatever WMDs Iraq might or might not have, but, as a senior administration official \u003ca href=\"http://www.tinyrevolution.com/mt/archives/000266.html\">later explained\u003c/a>, by the simple and highly galling fact of Saddam Hussein&#8217;s &#8220;defiance&#8221; of the U.S.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When the September 11 terrorist attacks gave them the opportunity, the administration&#8217;s conservative wing, including Bolton, had no interest in sending inspectors to Iraq to see if Hussein had WMD. They wanted to simply use WMD as &#8220;\u003ca href=\"http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/1028-01.htm\">justification you can jump on\u003c/a>&#8221; to invade &#8212; without bothering to check whether Iraq actually had anything. (It was only in the fall of 2002 that Colin Powell and Tony Blair prevailed upon Bush to go to the United Nations and go through the motions of inspections.)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>However, Bolton and company faced an immediate obstacle: the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and its Brazilian diplomat leader José Bustani.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The OPCW had been formed in 1997, and is headquartered at the Hague in the Netherlands. It exists to administer a 1993 arms control treaty prohibiting the manufacture and use of chemical weapons.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Iraq had informed the OPCW in late 2001 that it wanted to sign the treaty. This would require Iraq to provide the organization with a list of any chemical weapons stockpiles it possessed &#8212; and submit to intrusive OPCW inspections.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This set off loud alarm bells in the Bush administration, since inspections could not just delay their desired war, but undermine the case for it in the first place. As Bustani \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/14/world/to-ousted-boss-arms-watchdog-was-seen-as-an-obstacle-in-iraq.html\">put it\u003c/a> years later, his willingness to consider inspecting Iraq “caused an uproar in Washington,” and it quickly &#8220;became evident that the Americans were serious about getting rid of me.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>According to Bustani, “Everybody knew there weren’t any [banned chemical weapons]. An inspection would make it obvious there were no weapons to destroy. This would completely nullify the decision to invade.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The U.S. was not about to let this happen. Bolton took the lead in ousting Bustani and replacing him with someone more pliable. After the Bush administration failed to win a March 2002 no-confidence vote from OPCW&#8217;s executive committee, it threatened to cut off its funding of the OPCW, which accounted for 22 percent of its budget.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This got everyone&#8217;s attention. The next month, with Bolton in the Netherlands to supervise, the OPCW \u003ca href=\"https://2001-2009.state.gov/t/isn/cwc/fs/9631.htm\">voted to fire Bustani\u003c/a> with 48 countries voting yes, seven voting no, and 43 abstaining. A European diplomat \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/23/world/us-forces-out-head-of-chemical-arms-agency.html\">commented\u003c/a> at the time that &#8220;I think a lot of people swallowed this because they thought it was better for Bustani to be removed than have the U.S. pull out and see the organization collapse.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Bustani could not immediately be reached for comment. In response to an interview request sent to his assistant, Bolton told her to pass along the message: &#8220;no comment &#8212; he can read my book!&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Bolton&#8217;s 2008 memoir, &#8220;\u003ca href=\"http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Surrender-Is-Not-an-Option/John-Bolton/9781416552857\">Surrender Is Not an Option: Defending America at the United Nations\u003c/a>,&#8221; states that Bustani was &#8220;a management disaster, whose performance called into question the OPCW&#8217;s credibility and indeed the [Chemical Weapons Convention] itself. State&#8217;s arms controllers complained repeatedly about Bustani&#8217;s incompetence.&#8221; Bolton&#8217;s book does not provide any details about Bustani&#8217;s purported poor performance and incompetence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While Bolton&#8217;s wing of the administration won that round, they were unable to prevent later inspections of Iraq under the auspices of the U.N. Those inspectors then failed to find anything &#8212; since Iraq did not actually possess any banned weapons &#8212; and the U.S. and its allies went ahead and invaded anyway in March 2003.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Bolton went on to make the bogus case for war in other ways, pushing some of the administration&#8217;s \u003ca href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=-kykEEiazfgC&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;ots=fqvnYifTUl&amp;dq=%22john%20bolton%22%20aluminum%20tubes&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q=%22john%20bolton%22%20aluminum%20tubes&amp;f=false\">key WMD lies\u003c/a>.

Entre os sócios e representantes dessas companhias, a maior parte declarou morar em São Paulo, no Rio de Janeiro e em Portugal. Cada um desses lugares mantêm 31 registros de empresas na ilha. As firmas relacionadas aos 148 brasileiros também possuem 172 pessoas de outras nacionalidades entre sócios ou representantes. Foram registrados ainda 38 estrangeiros que declararam morar no Brasil ao abrirem suas firmas em Malta.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>O Brasil taxa em 25% as operações realizadas de empresas locais tanto para paraísos fiscais como para regimes fiscais privilegiados. Normalmente, essa taxação é de 15%. No cadastro acessado pelo EIC, estão as empresas de Malta que possuem dados públicos, boa parte classificada como &#8220;Limited&#8221;. Portanto, não há por aqui alerta especial em relação a essas firmas.

O quadro atual é extorsivo, gera uma distorção sistêmica, que é a inversão de um sistema tributário justo. Os que não têm recursos são obrigados a pagar as taxas de seus países de origem.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>O advogado ressalta que, a princípio, não há qualquer ilegalidade em um brasileiro possuir uma empresa num paraíso fiscal. Os motivos legítimos podem ir desde uma proteção maior ao investimento à busca de uma base no exterior para a expansão de negócios. Casos recentes, porém, como o da Lava Jato, têm, não à toa, levantado suspeitas generalizadas sobre o uso deste tipo de recurso:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Cada vez mais vamos ver as grandes empresas ponderando sobre o uso de paraísos fiscais, principalmente pelos casos recentes de repercussão negativa.

É dinheiro “perdido” tanto para o Tesouro do país quanto para a base tributável dos vizinhos europeus, onde boa parte das matrizes das firmas com filiais em Malta está sediada.\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-none' data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='none'>O país precisa se manter atrativo para as empresas internacionais.\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>Na maioria dos países da UE, o imposto sobre o rendimento líquido de empresas costuma ficar entre 20% e 35%.

Janot argumenta que Rodrigo Rocha Loures, então assessor especial de Temer, não tinha poderes para resolver a questão sozinho e nem poderia lidar com valores tão altos sem que houvesse um aval do presidente.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>\u003cb>Renan\u003c/b>\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>O caso do senador Renan Calheiros, um veterano na arte de habitar o imaginário popular da corrupção, é emblemático das diferenças. Na Lava Jato, o senador é alvo de oito inquéritos diferentes sobre supostas práticas do crime. Até aqui, Rodrigo Janot somente conseguiu finalizar uma \u003ca href=\"http://g1.globo.com/politica/operacao-lava-jato/noticia/pgr-denuncia-renan-calheiros-ao-stf-na-lava-jato.ghtml\" target=\"_blank\">denúncia contra ele\u003c/a>. Nela, o procurador-geral acusa o peemedebista de receber R$ 800 mil da empreiteira Serveng, em 2010, como contrapartida a um contrato bilionário que a empresa conseguiu com a Petrobras para a construção de uma refinaria de petróleo no Maranhão.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Aqui, Janot também constrói sua denúncia com base na associação entre Renan e um emissário – no caso, o deputado federal Aníbal Gomes (PMDB-CE). A denúncia parte de declarações dadas em acordo de delação premiada pelo ex-diretor da Petrobras Paulo Roberto Costa. Segundo Costa, ele participou de reuniões chamadas por Aníbal na casa de Renan ou no gabinete do senador no Congresso, o que levou o então diretor “a confirmar que Aníbal era emissário de Renan, agindo e atuando em comunhão de desígnios em benefício desse último”. Mas não há qualquer evidência do teor do que foi discutido nessas reuniões.\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-right' data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='right'> A denúncia parte de declarações dadas em acordo de delação premiada pelo ex-diretor da Petrobras Paulo Roberto Costa.\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>Outro detalhe é que os R$ 800 mil de que Renan teria sido beneficiário foram pagos por meio de doação oficial de campanha em uma conta formal do PMDB, registrada no TSE. Embora a Procuradoria esteja adotando em diversos casos o entendimento de que \u003ca href=\"https://jota.info/justica/2a-turma-do-stf-doacao-eleitoral-pode-maquiar-propina-07032017\" target=\"_blank\">existe corrupção mesmo quando a doação é oficial\u003c/a>, mas está atrelada a uma contrapartida do agente público no governo ou no Congresso, é uma base muito mais frágil do que o caso Temer, em que os R$ 500 mil entregues a Rodrigo Rocha Loures não tinham nenhuma relação com contexto eleitoral.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1024px;'> \u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-134820\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/06/538632592-1498593343-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"TOPSHOT - Brazilian Senate President Renan Calheiros participates in a plenary session of the senate in Brasilia, on June 7, 2016.&lt;br /&gt; Brazil's Prosecutor General Rodrigo Janot has asked the Supreme Court to authorize the arrests of Senate President Renan Calheiros, former Brazilian president Jose Sarney, Senator Romero Juca and powerful lawmaker Eduardo Cunha, O Globo newspaper reported.  / AFP / ANDRESSA ANHOLETE        (Photo credit should read ANDRESSA ANHOLETE/AFP/Getty Images)\" />\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">Senador Renan Calheiros durante sessão no Senado.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class='caption source' style=''>Foto: AFP/Getty Images\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\n\u003cp>Não há gravação de conversas. A PGR se apoia em uma sequência de datas que evidenciam que a empreiteira Serveng somente conseguiu o contrato depois de doar para a campanha de Renan. “A assinatura da primeira autorização de serviço e a primeira doação da Serveng ao Diretório Nacional do PMDB serem no mesmo dia corroboram todo o esquema criminoso, deixando de ser mera coincidência de datas”, escreveu Janot no caso Renan.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Outro dado usado pela Procuradoria para reforçar a acusação contra Renan é que a empreiteira somente conseguiu o contrato porque foi convidada a disputar a licitação. E, para que o convite pudesse ser realizado, uma mudança cadastral tinha de ser feita para que a empresa aparecesse num nível melhor de qualificação. Essa mudança, segundo as investigações, aconteceu dentro de um intervalo de 50 dias entre duas visitas de Aníbal Gomes a Paulo Roberto Costa, na Petrobras. Renan não participou dessas reuniões citadas pela Procuradoria-Geral da República.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>\u003cb>Cunha   \u003c/b>\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>A situação de Renan, no entanto, é bem diferente da que envolve Eduardo Cunha na primeira de três denúncias oferecidas por Janot contra ele, quando ele ainda era deputado e tinha o direito a foro privilegiado.

The \u003ca href=\"https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/r-oao-campaign-against-arms-trade-v-ssfit-and-others1.pdf\">58-page verdict\u003c/a> concluded that there was no “real risk” of “serious violations.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>CAAT said in a statement that it was “disappointed” with the ruling and plans to pursue an appeal. Nongovernmental organizations working in Yemen described the judgment as “a dark day for the people of Yemen.” More than half of the three-day hearing of the judicial review case that was held in February was closed to CAAT, the press, and the public. The judges stated that the U.K. government had “more sophisticated sources of information” than CAAT, but claimed the information could not be disclosed in open court “for national security reasons.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>British government officials licensed the sale of $4.2 billion (£3.3 billion) worth of arms to Saudi Arabia in the first 12 months of the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen, which is now in its third year.

However, the Saudi Joint Incidents Assessment Team has released the initial results of an investigation into just 20 strikes, including attacks on two Médecins Sans Frontières-supported medical facilities in northern Yemen. In 14 of the 20 strikes, the Saudi investigators absolved the coalition of wrongdoing or responsibility for alleged violations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1024px;'>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/07/yemen-hospital-cholera-humanitarian-crisis-1499439596.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-136091\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/07/yemen-hospital-cholera-humanitarian-crisis-1499439596-1024x658.jpg\" alt=\"Yemenis suspected of being infected with cholera receive treatment at a makeshift hospital in Sanaa on May 25, 2017.Cholera has killed 315 people in Yemen in under a month, the World Health Organization has said, as another aid organization warned Monday the outbreak could become a &quot;full-blown epidemic&quot;. / AFP PHOTO (Photo credit should read /AFP/Getty Images)\" />\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">Yemenis suspected of being infected with cholera receive treatment at a makeshift hospital in Sana on May 25, 2017.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class='caption source' style=''>Photo: Mohammed Huwais/AFP/Getty Images\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\n\u003cp>An array of international organizations — including a U.N. panel of experts, the European Parliament, and humanitarian and human rights groups — has repeatedly condemned the ongoing airstrikes against Yemen as unlawful.

Human Rights Council to establish a non-Saudi-led inquiry into alleged violations of international law.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sir Vince Cable, a former British government minister, told The Intercept following Monday’s ruling: “I am disappointed by the verdict. U.K. dependence on exports to Saudi is unhealthy and is driving our foreign policy.” Cable signed off on U.K. arms sales to Saudi Arabia in his role as business secretary in 2015, the first year of the war. He has previously claimed he was “\u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/04/mod-seriously-misled-me-on-saudi-arms-sales-says-vince-cable\">seriously misled\u003c/a>” by the Ministry of Defence in the process of his decision making on whether to grant permission for sales to Saudi.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Mark Goldring, head of the U.K.-based charity Oxfam, also expressed dissatisfaction with the judgment. “So much evidence has been presented in this case of the devastating impact on Yemen from selling arms to Saudi Arabia,&#8221; said Goldring. “There is a clear moral case for the government to suspend its sales.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Human Rights Watch, which has documented numerous cases of potential war crimes in Yemen, called the verdict “a serious setback for efforts to hold the British government accountable,” adding that the judgment rejected detailed evidence gathered on the ground.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The ruling was handed down amid a rapidly deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Yemen. Seven million people are facing imminent famine, and a cholera outbreak has killed more than 1,700 people since April — a crisis described by the United Nations humanitarian chief, Stephen O’Brien, as a “man-made catastrophe” resulting from the conflict. The number of cholera cases in Yemen is escalating at more than double the rate previously predicted by the U.N.’s World Health Organization, with numbers now reaching 300,000.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The war in Yemen has had a major impact on food imports as a result of the Saudi-led coalition imposing restrictions on imports, ostensibly to prevent weapons from reaching their opponents — Yemen’s northern Houthi rebels and soldiers loyal to the country’s former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. In peacetime, Yemen imports about 90 percent of its food. In addition, Houthi-Saleh forces have also obstructed food and aid deliveries around the country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The conflict began in 2014 after Houthi fighters seized Yemen’s capital. It escalated in early 2015, forcing incumbent President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile in Saudi Arabia. Since March 2015, Saudi, along with a coalition of regional nations backed by the U.S. and the U.K., has been trying to push back the Houthi-Saleh forces.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In 2015, The Intercept \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/09/01/yemen-hidden-war-saudi-coalition-killing-civilians/\">investigated\u003c/a> eight Saudi coalition strikes that killed up to 175 civilians, revealing evidence of a pattern of indiscriminate bombing of civilians and targeting of first responders. Some 10,000 people have died in the conflict, with Saudi coalition airstrikes being the “single largest cause of casualties,” according to an August 2016 U.N. report.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While Saudi Arabia is the U.K.’s top arms buyer, the U.S. is the biggest exporter of weapons and military training to the kingdom. The boom in defense sales to the Saudis is set to continue after President Donald Trump announced a record arms deal worth up to $350 billion over the next 10 years during his first foreign trip as president to Riyadh in May, beating the \u003ca href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-security-idUSKCN11D2JQ\">previous record\u003c/a> set by the Obama administration of more than $115 billion worth of sales from 2009 to 2016.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Similar recent attempts to suspend U.S. arms sales to Saudi have so far failed. The Trump administration notified Congress last month of its intention to resume the export of precision-guided weapons to the country, suspended under Obama in December.

Maia, o pai, também tinha apelidos especiais na planilha secreta da Odebrecht, divulgada este ano: \u003ca href=\"https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/cesar-maia-citado-como-despota-rodrigo-maia-como-volante-em-inquerito-21200948\">“déspota” ou “inca”\u003c/a>.

Invariavelmente, a criação de novos registros está associada a novas obras tocadas pela empreiteira.

A opção por dividir as denúncias amplifica o potencial de minar a sustentação política que mantém Temer no cargo e maximiza o desgaste do peemedebista – que deverá se articular seguidamente, e mediante constante concessão de benesses em tempos de penúria econômica, para barrar uma derrota no plenário da Câmara.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Mesmo que Temer sobreviva às acusações de crimes praticados por ele no exercício do cargo, e Rodrigo Maia permaneça como presidente da Câmara, a posição do deputado continua sendo altamente estratégica tanto para a Odebrecht quanto para o BTG Pactual.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Caso fosse  presidente da República, Maia estaria sujeito à \u003ca href=\"http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2011-2014/2013/Lei/L12813.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Lei de Conflito de Interesses\u003c/a>\u003ca href=\"http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2011-2014/2013/lei/l12813.htm\">,\u003c/a> de 2013, que se aplica a cargos no  Poder Executivo.

A PGR ainda não apresentou pedido de abertura de inquérito sobre este caso.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>O histórico de Braga com a Justiça vai além da Lava Jato. Em 2013, o STF já tinha aberto outro inquérito contra o senador, ainda em andamento. Ele é suspeito de \u003ca href=\"http://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,stf-investiga-eduardo-braga-por-desvio-e-fraude-no-am,1012164\">desvio e fraude em desapropriação de um terreno em Manaus\u003c/a> por valor acima do real.

O envolvimento de Eduardo Braga no caso foi arquivado em decisão do ministro Gilmar Mendes no ano seguinte.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>O vice em sua chapa é Marcelo Ramos (PR), que estava bem cotado como pré-candidato.  Mas às vésperas do prazo legal aceitou recomendação de seu partido e se uniu a Braga. O acerto veio por orientação e com as bênçãos do deputado federal Alfredo Nascimento, principal nome do PR no Estado e que se notabilizou por ter sido o \u003ca href=\"https://oglobo.globo.com/politica/alfredo-nascimento-entrega-carta-de-demissao-dilma-governo-manda-pf-investigar-denuncias-2720140\">alvo inaugural da “faxina”\u003c/a> promovida por Dilma Rousseff em seu primeiro ano de governo, quando tentou depurar seu governo de ministros envolvidos em suspeitas de corrupção. Nascimento era o ministros dos Transportes.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Amazonino Mendes, um clássico da velha política\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>O principal rival de Braga é Amazonino Mendes, que tem um leve favoritismo na disputa, conforme as sondagens feitas até aqui. Um dos mais longevos políticos locais, Amazonino carrega o Estado no nome.

Cohn was there to offer his views about jobs and the economy.

Yet the president-elect had apparently failed to appreciate that the government would need to come up with hundreds of billions of dollars to fund his plans.

Trump proclaimed that Hillary Clinton was in the firm’s pockets, as was Ted Cruz. It was Goldman Sachs that Trump singled out when he railed against a system rigged in favor of the global elite — one that “robbed our working class, stripped our country of wealth, and put money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.” Cohn, as president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, had been at the heart of it all. Aggressive and relentless, a former aluminum siding salesman and commodities broker with a nose for making money, Cohn had turned Goldman’s sleepy home loan unit into what a Senate staffer called “one of the largest mortgage trading desks in the world.” There, he aggressively pushed his sales team to sell mortgage-backed securities to unaware investors even as he watched over “the big short,” Goldman’s decision to bet billions of dollars that the market would collapse.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now Cohn would be coordinating economic policy for the populist president.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The conflicts between the two men were striking. Cohn ran a giant investment bank with offices in financial capitals around the globe, one deeply committed to a world with few economic borders. Trump’s nationalist campaign contradicted everything Goldman Sachs and its top executives represented on the global stage.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trump raged against “offshoring” by American companies during the 2016 campaign. He even threatened “retribution,”­ a 35 percent tariff on any goods imported into the United States by a company that had moved jobs overseas. But Cohn laid out Goldman’s very different view of offshoring at an investor conference in Naples, Florida, in November. There, Cohn explained unapologetically that Goldman had \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/853075/goldman-sachs-and-other-wall-street-banks-moved-thousands-of-jobs-out-of-the-us-will-trump-go-after-them-too/\">offshored\u003c/a> its back-office staff, including payroll and IT, to Bangalore, India, now home to the firm’s largest office outside New York City: “We hire people there because they work for cents on the dollar versus what people work for in the United States.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Candidate Trump promised to create millions of new jobs, \u003ca href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/83795186-157.html\">vowing\u003c/a> to be “the greatest jobs president that God ever created.” Cohn, as Goldman Sachs’s president and COO, oversaw the firm’s mergers and acquisitions business that had, over the previous three years, led to the loss of at least 22,000 U.S. jobs, according to a \u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzouW0SGr8rlcHRONzB1b2tZU00/view\">study\u003c/a> by two advocacy groups. Early in his candidacy, Trump described as “disgusting” Pfizer’s decision to buy a smaller Irish competitor in order to execute a “corporate inversion,” a maneuver in which a U.S. company moves its headquarters overseas to reduce its tax burden. The Pfizer deal ultimately fell through. But in 2016, in the heat of the campaign, Goldman advised on a megadeal that saw Johnson Controls, a Fortune 500 company based in Milwaukee, buy the Ireland-based Tyco International with the same goal. A few months later, with Goldman’s help, Johnson Controls had executed its inversion.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>With Cohn’s appointment, Trump now had three Goldman Sachs alums in top positions inside his administration: Steve Bannon, who was a vice president at Goldman when he left the firm in 1990, as chief strategist, and Steve Mnuchin, who had spent 17 years at Goldman, as Treasury secretary. And there were more to come. A few weeks later, another Goldman partner, Dina Powell, joined the White House as a senior counselor for economic initiatives. Goldman was a longtime client of Jay Clayton, Trump’s choice to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission; Clayton had represented Goldman after the 2008 financial crisis, and his wife Gretchen worked there as a wealth management adviser. And there was the brief, colorful tenure of Anthony Scaramucci as White House communications director: Scaramucci had been a vice president at Goldman Sachs before leaving to co-found his own investment company.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Even before Scaramucci, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., had joked that enough Goldman alum were working for the Trump administration to open a branch office in the White House.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“There was a devastating financial crisis just over eight years ago,” Warren said. “Goldman Sachs was at the heart of that crisis. The idea that the president is now going to turn over the country’s economic policy to a senior Goldman executive turns my stomach.” Prior administrations often had one or two people from Goldman serving in top positions.

At the end of 2016, he owned some 900,000 shares of Goldman Sachs stock, a stake worth around $220 million on the day Trump announced his appointment. Plus, he’d sold a million more Goldman shares over the previous half-dozen years. In 2007 alone, the year of the big short, Goldman Sachs paid him nearly $73 million — more than the firm paid CEO Lloyd Blankfein. The disclosure forms Cohn filled out to join the administration indicate he owned assets valued at $252 million to $611 million. That may or may not include the $65 million parting gift Goldman’s board of directors gave him for “outstanding leadership” just days before Trump was sworn in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Like anyone taking a top job in the Trump administration, Cohn was \u003ca href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/28/executive-order-ethics-commitments-executive-branch-appointees\">required\u003c/a> to sign a pledge vowing not to participate for the next two years in any matter “that is directly and substantially related to my former employer or former clients, including regulations and contracts.” But presidents have sometimes issued waivers to these requirements, and it is unclear whether the Trump administration is making such waivers public.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sens. Warren and Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, sent Cohn a letter a few days later. They brought up the $65 million bonus and asked him to publicly recuse himself from any issue that could have a direct or “significant indirect” impact on his old firm. Cohn never responded to the letter, and if he has ever received a waiver, it has not been made available to the public or the Office of Government Ethics.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Consistent with the Trump administration’s stringent ethics rules, Mr. Cohn will recuse himself from participating in any matter directly involving his former employer, Goldman Sachs,” White House spokesperson Natalie Strom said. “The White House will not comment further.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The White House declined requests to make Cohn available for an interview and declined to answer a detailed set of questions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Cohn shared the podium with fellow Goldman alum Mnuchin (the two made partner there the same year) when the administration unveiled its new tax plan, one that, if the past is prelude, had the potential to save Goldman more than $1 billion a year in corporate taxes. The president had promised to “do a number” on financial reforms implemented after the 2008 subprime crisis, including one that threatened to cost Goldman several billion dollars a year in revenues. Under Cohn, the administration has introduced new rules easing initial public offerings — a Goldman Sachs specialty dating back to the start of the last century, when the firm handled the IPOs of Sears, Roebuck; F. W. Woolworth; and Studebaker. As Trump’s top economic policy adviser, Cohn can exert influence over regulatory agencies that have shaken billions in penalties and settlements out of Goldman Sachs in recent years. And his former colleagues inside Goldman’s Public Sector and Infrastructure group likely appreciate the Trump administration’s infrastructure plan, which is more or less exactly as Cohn first pitched it inside Trump Tower in November.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“It’s hard to see how Gary Cohn recusing himself would solve a lot of these conflicts because nearly every major decision of his job would have a significant impact, likely billions of dollars, on Goldman Sachs and its executives,” said Tyler Gellasch, an attorney and former Senate staffer who helped draft Dodd-Frank, the landmark financial reform law passed in the wake of the financial meltdown. “Goldman touches nearly every aspect of the economy, from selling U.S. treasuries to helping companies go public, and the National Economic Council advises on all of that.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the wake of last month’s white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Cohn confessed to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b85beea2-8924-11e7-bf50-e1c239b45787\">Financial Times\u003c/a> that he has “come under enormous pressure both to resign and to remain.” But the man who the Washington Post has dubbed Trump’s “moderate voice” declared that neo-Nazis would not force “this Jew” to leave his job. “As a patriotic American, I am reluctant to leave my post as director of the National Economic Council,” Cohn told FT. “I feel a duty to fulfill my commitment to work on behalf of the American people.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Or at least a few of them. The Trump economic agenda, it turns out, is largely the Goldman agenda, one with the potential to deliver any number of gifts to the firm that made Cohn colossally rich. If Cohn stays, it will be to pursue an agenda of aggressive financial deregulation and massive corporate tax cuts — he seeks to slash rates by 57 percent — that would dramatically increase profits for large financial players like Goldman. It is an agenda as radical in its scope and impact as Bannon’s was.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/AP_766382431678-1505494383.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-146605\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/AP_766382431678-1505494383.jpg\" alt=\"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump holds up his book 'The Art of the Deal', given to him by a fan as he speaks during a campaign stop Saturday, Nov. 21, 2015 in Birmingham, Ala.

He talks of military schools and visits to construction sites with his father and wrote in “The Art of the Deal” that in the second grade, “I actually gave a teacher a black eye. I punched my music teacher because I didn’t think he knew anything about music and I almost got expelled.” Yet when the authors of the book “Trump Revealed: An American Journey of Ambition, Ego, Money, and Power” spoke to several of his childhood friends, none of them recalled the incident. Trump himself crumpled when asked about the incident during the 2016 campaign: “When I say ‘punch,’ when you’re that age, nobody punches very hard.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Gary Cohn, however, is the middle-class kid and self-made millionaire Trump imagines himself to be. It appears that Cohn actually did slug a grade-school teacher in the face. “I was being abused,” Cohn told author Malcolm Gladwell, who interviewed him for his book, “David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants,” back when Cohn was still president of Goldman Sachs. As a child, Cohn struggled with dyslexia, a reading disorder people didn’t understand much about when Cohn attended school in the 1970s in a suburb outside Cleveland. “You’re a 6- or 7- or 8-year-old-kid, and you’re in a public-school setting, and everyone thinks you’re an idiot,” Cohn confessed to Gladwell. “You’d try to get up every morning and say, today is going to be better, but after you do that a couple of years, you realize that today is going to be no different than yesterday.” One time when he was in the fourth grade, a teacher put him under her desk, rolled her chair close, and started kicking him, Cohn said. “I pushed the chair back, hit her in the face, and walked out.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While Trump’s father was a wealthy real estate developer, Cohn’s father was an electrician. When Trump sought to get into the casino business, his father loaned him $14 million. When Cohn couldn’t find a job after graduating from college, all his father could do was find him one selling aluminum siding. While Trump has the instincts of a reality show producer and an eye for spectacle, Cohn prefers to operate in the shadows.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But they likely recognize much of themselves in the other. Both Cohn and Trump are alpha males — men of action unlikely to be found holed up in an office reading through stacks of policy reports. In fact, neither seems to be much of a reader. Cohn told Gladwell it would take him roughly six hours to read just 22 pages; he ended his time with the author by wishing him luck on “your book I’m not going to read.” Both have a transactional view of politics. Trump switched his voter registration between Democratic, Republican, and independent seven times between 1999 and 2012. In the 2000s, his foundation gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation, and he contributed $4,700 to Hillary Clinton’s senatorial campaigns. He even bought and refurbished a golf course in Westchester County a few miles from the Clinton home, in part, Trump once admitted, to ingratiate himself with the Clintons. Cohn is a registered Democrat who has given at least $275,000 to Democrats over the years, including to the campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, but also around $250,000 to Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There are also striking similarities in their business histories. Both have a knack for weathering scandals and setbacks and coming out on top. Trump has filed for bankruptcy four times, started a long list of failed businesses (casinos, an airline, a football team, a steak company), but managed, through his best-selling books and highly rated reality TV show, to recast himself as the world’s greatest businessman. During Cohn’s tenure as president, Goldman Sachs faced lawsuits and federal investigations that resulted in $9 billion in \u003ca href=\"http://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/goldman-sachs\">fines\u003c/a> for misconduct in the run-up to the subprime meltdown. Goldman not only survived but thrived, posting record profits — and Cohn was rewarded with handsome bonuses and a position at the top of the new administration.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Cohn’s path to the White House started with a tale of brass and bluster that would make Trump the salesman proud. Still in his 20s and stuck selling aluminum siding, Cohn made a play that would change his life. In the fall of 1982, while visiting the company’s home office on Long Island, he stole a day from work and headed to the U.S. commodities exchange in Manhattan, hoping to talk himself into a job. He overheard an important-looking man say he was heading to LaGuardia Airport; Cohn blurted out that he was headed there, too. He jumped into a cab with the man and, Cohn told Gladwell, who devoted six pages of “David and Goliath” to Cohn’s underdog rise, “I lied all the way to the airport.” The man confided to Cohn that his firm had just put him in charge of a market, options, that he knew little about. Cohn likely knew even less, but he assured his backseat companion that he could get him up to speed. Cohn then spent the weekend reading and re-reading a book called “Options as a Strategic Investment.” Within the week, he’d been hired as the man’s assistant.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Cohn soon learned enough to venture off on his own and established himself as an independent silver trader on the floor of the New York Commodities Exchange. In 1990, Goldman Sachs, arguably the most elite firm on Wall Street, offered him a job.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-174012149-1505494436.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-146606\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-174012149-1505494436.jpg\" alt=\"The Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. logo is displayed at the company's booth on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., on Friday, July 19, 2013.

Marcus Goldman, a Jewish immigrant from Germany, leased a cellar office next to a coal chute in 1869. There, in an office one block from Wall Street, he bought the bad debt of local businesses that needed quick cash. His son-in-law, Samuel Sachs, joined the firm in 1882. A generation later, in 1906, the firm made its first mark, arranging for the public sale of shares in Sears, Roebuck. Goldman Sachs’s influence over politics dates back at least to 1914. That year, Henry Goldman, the founder’s son, was invited to advise Woodrow Wilson’s administration about the creation of a central bank, mandated by the Federal Reserve Act, which had passed the previous year. Goldman Sachs men have played important roles in U.S. government ever since.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There was the occasional scandal, such as Goldman Sachs’s role in the 1970 collapse of Penn Central railroad, then the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history. Still, the firm built a reputation as a sober, elite partnership that served its clients ably. In 1979, when John Whitehead, a senior partner and co-chairman, set to paper what he called Goldman’s “Business Principles,” he began with the firm’s most cherished belief: The client’s interests come before all else.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Two years later, Goldman took a step that signaled the beginning of the end of that culture. In the fall of 1981, Goldman purchased J. Aron &amp; Co., a commodities trading firm. Some within the partnership were against the acquisition, worried over how profane, often crude, trading culture would mix with Goldman’s restrained, well-mannered way of doing business. “We were street fighters,” one former J. Aron partner told Fortune magazine in 2008.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The J. Aron team moved into the Goldman Sachs offices in lower Manhattan, but didn’t adopt its culture. Within a few years, it was producing well over $1 billion a year in profits. They were 300 employees inside a firm of 6,000, but were posting one-third of Goldman’s total profits. The cultural shift, it turned out, was moving in the other direction. J. Aron, according to a book by Charles D. Ellis, a former Goldman consultant, brought to Goldman “a trading culture that would become dominant in the firm.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Lloyd Blankfein, who ascended to chairman and CEO in in 2006, started his Goldman career at J. Aron, a year after Goldman acquired the firm. “We didn’t have the word ‘client’ or ‘customer’ at the old J. Aron,” Blankfein told \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2008/03/17/lloyd-blankfein-goldman-sachs/\">Fortune\u003c/a> magazine two years after taking over as CEO. “We had counter-parties.” Cohn joined J. Aron eight years after Blankfein did, in 1990. Four years later, Blankfein was put in charge of the firm’s Fixed Income, Currency, and Commodities division, which included J. Aron. Cohn, loyal and hard-working, with an instinct for connecting with people who can help him, became Blankfein’s “\u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703374104575337180461840038\">corporate problem solver\u003c/a>.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The emergence of “Bad Goldman” — and Cohn’s central role in that drama — is really the story of the rise of the traders inside the firm. “As trading came to be a bigger part of Wall Street, I noticed that the vision changed,” said Robert Kaplan, a former Goldman Sachs vice chairman, who left in 2006 after working at the firm for 23 years. “The leaders were saying the same words, but they started to change incentives away from the value-added vision and tilt more to making money first. If making money is your vision, what lengths will you not go?”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At the height of the dot-com years, a debate raged within the firm. The firm underwrote dozens of technology IPOs, including Microsoft and Yahoo, in the 1980s and 1990s, minting an untold number of multimillionaires and the occasional billionaire. Some of the companies they were bringing public generated no profits at all, while Goldman was generating up to $3 billion in profits a year. It seemed inevitable that some within Goldman Sachs began to dream of jettisoning the Goldman’s century-old partnership structure and taking their firm public, too. Jon Corzine was running the firm then — he would later go into politics in the Goldman tradition, first as a U.S. senator and then as New Jersey governor — and was four-square in favor of going public. Corzine’s second in command, Henry Paulson — who would go on to serve as Treasury secretary — was against the idea. But Corzine ordered up a study that supported his view that remaining private stifled Goldman’s competitive opportunities and promoted Paulson to co-senior partner. Paulson soon got on board. In May 1999, Goldman sold $3.7 billion worth of shares in the company. At the end of the first day of trading, Corzine’s and Paulson’s stakes in the firm were each worth $205 million. Cohn’s and Mnuchin’s shares were each worth $112 million. And Blankfein ended up with $168 million in company stock.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Like any publicly traded company, there would now be pressure on Goldman Sachs to make its quarterly numbers and “maximize shareholder value.” Discarding the partner model also meant the loss of a valuable restraint on risk-taking and bad behavior. Under the old system, any losses or fines came out of the partners’ pockets. In the early 1990s, for example, the firm was involved in transactions with Robert Maxwell, a London-based media mogul who was accused of stealing hundreds of millions of pounds from his companies’ pension funds. The $253 million that Goldman Sachs paid to settle lawsuits brought by pension funds over its involvement was split among the firm’s 84 limited partners. Now any losses are paid by a publicly traded entity owned by shareholders, with no direct financial liability for the decision-makers themselves. In theory, Goldman could claw back bonuses in response to executives’ bad behavior. But in 2016, when Goldman paid over $5 billion to settle charges brought by the Justice Department that the firm misled customers in the sale of a subprime mortgage product during Cohn’s time overseeing that unit, the Goldman board declined to dock Cohn’s pay. Instead, the company \u003ca href=\"http://www.goldmansachs.com/s/2017-proxy-statement/HTML1/goldman_sachs-proxy2017_0061.htm\">awarded\u003c/a> him a $5.5 million cash bonus and another $12.6 million in company stock.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-94843217-1505494531.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-146608\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-94843217-1505494531.jpg\" alt=\"UNITED STATES - JUNE 16:  The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives, from right, Gary Cohn, president and co-chief operating officer, Lloyd Blankfein, chairman and chief executive officer, and Jon Winkelreid, president and co-chief operating officer, appear in a 2006 annual report arranged for a photograph in New York, U.S., on Monday, June 16, 2008.

When Blankfein was made vice chairman in charge of the firm’s multibillion-dollar global commodities business and its equities division, Cohn took over as co-head of FICC, Blankfein’s previous position. That meant Cohn was overseeing not just J. Aron and the firm’s commodities business, but also its currency trades and bond sales. By the start of 2004, Blankfein was promoted to president and COO, and Cohn was named co-head of global securities. At that point, Cohn had authority over the mortgage-trading desk. Under Cohn, the firm aggressively moved into the subprime mortgage market, using Goldman’s own money and that of its customers to help stoke the housing bubble.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Goldman was already enabling subprime predators, such as Ameriquest and New Century Financial, by providing them with the cash infusions they needed to scale up their lending to individual home buyers. Cohn would steer the firm deeper into the subprime frenzy by setting up Goldman as a patron of some of these same mortgage originators. During his tenure, Goldman snapped up loans from New Century, Countrywide, and other notorious mortgage originators and bundled them into deals with opaque names, such as ABACUS and GSAMP. Under Cohn’s watchful eye, Goldman’s brokers then funneled slices to customers they sold on the wisdom of holding mortgage-backed securities in their portfolios.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One such creation, GSAA Home Equity Trust 2006-2, illustrates Goldman’s disregard for the quality of loans it was buying and packaging into security deals. Created in early 2006, the investment vehicle was made up of more than $1 billion in home loans Goldman had bought from Ameriquest, one of the nation’s largest and most aggressive subprime lenders. By that point, the lender already had set aside \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/21/business/ameriquest-to-pay-325-million-in-a-settlement-over-lending.html\">$325 million\u003c/a> to settle a probe by attorneys general and banking regulators in 49 states, who accused Ameriquest of misleading thousands of borrowers about the costs of their loans and falsifying home appraisals and other key documents. Yet GSAA Home Equity Trust 2006-2 was filled with Ameriquest loans made to more than 3,000 homeowners in Arizona, Illinois, Florida, and elsewhere. By the end of 2008, 65 percent of the roughly 1,400 borrowers whose loans remained in the deal were in default, had filed for bankruptcy, or had been targeted for foreclosure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In just three years, Goldman Sachs had increased its trading volume by a factor of 50, which the \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703374104575337180461840038\">Wall Street Journal\u003c/a> attributed to “Cohn’s successful push to rev up risk-taking and use of Goldman’s own capital to make a profit” — what the industry calls proprietary trading, or prop trading. The 2010 Journal article quoted Justin Gmelich, then the firm’s mortgage chief, who said of Cohn, “He reshaped the culture of the mortgage department into more of a trading environment.” In 2005, with Cohn overseeing the firm’s home loan desk, Goldman underwrote $103 billion in mortgage-backed securities and other more esoteric products, such as collateralized debt obligations, which often were priced based on giant pools of home loans. The following year, the firm underwrote deals worth $131 billion.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In 2006, CEO Henry Paulson left the firm to join George W. Bush’s cabinet as Treasury secretary. Blankfein, Cohn’s mentor and friend, took Paulson’s place. By tradition, Blankfein, a trader, should have elevated someone from the investment banking side to serve as his No. 2, so both sides of the firm would be represented in the top leadership. Instead he named Cohn, his long-time loyalist, and Jon Winkelried, who also had history on the trading side, as co-presidents and co-COOs. Winkelried, who had started at Goldman eight years before Cohn, had probably earned the right to hold those titles by himself. But Cohn had the advantage of his relationship with the CEO. Blankfein and Cohn vacationed together in the Caribbean and Mexico, owned homes near each other in the Hamptons, and their children attended the same school. Winkelreid was out in two years. The bromance between his fellow No. 2 and the top boss may have proved too much.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>With Blankfein and Cohn at the top, the transformation of Goldman Sachs was complete. By 2009, investment banking had \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703594404575192352257108006\">shrunk\u003c/a> to barely 10 percent of the firm’s revenues. Richard Marin, a former executive at Bear Stearns, a Goldman competitor that wouldn’t survive the mortgage meltdown, saw Cohn as “the root of the problem.” Explained Marin, “When you become arrogant in a trading sense, you begin to think that everybody’s a counterparty, not a customer, not a client. And as a counterparty, you’re allowed to rip their face off.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-86536728-1-1505494588.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-146609\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-86536728-1-1505494588.jpg\" alt=\"ANTIOCH, CA - MAY 07:  Weeds grow in the driveway of a foreclosed home May 7, 2009 in Antioch, California.

It was the fall of 2006 and, as Daniel Sparks, the Goldman partner overseeing the firm’s 400-person mortgage trading department, wrote in an email to several colleagues, “Subprime market getting hit hard.” The firm had lent millions to New Century, a mortgage lender dealing in the higher-risk subprime market. And now New Century was late on payments. Sparks could see that the wobbly housing market was having an impact on his department. For 10 consecutive trading days, his people had lost money. The dollar amounts were small to a behemoth like Goldman: between $5 million and $30 million a day. But the trend made Sparks jittery enough to share his concerns with the Goldman’s top executives: President Gary Cohn; David Viniar, the firm’s chief financial officer; and CEO Lloyd Blankfein.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sparks, a Cohn protégé, was running the mortgage desk that his mentor, only a few years earlier, had built into a major profit center for the bank. In 2006 and 2007, a report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found, the two “maintained frequent, direct contact” as Goldman worked to jettison the billions in subprime loans it had on its book. “One of my jobs at the time was to make sure Gary and David and Lloyd knew what was going on,” Sparks told William Cohan, author of the 2011 \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Money-Power-Goldman-Sachs-World/dp/038552384X/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\">book\u003c/a> “Money and Power: How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the World\u003cem>.\u003c/em>” “They don’t like surprises.” Viniar \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/19/business/19goldman.html\">summoned\u003c/a> around 20 traders and managers to a 30th floor conference room inside Goldman headquarters in lower Manhattan. It was there, on an unseasonably warm Thursday in December 2006, that the firm decided to initiate what people inside Goldman would eventually dub “the big short.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One name tossed around during the three-hour meeting was that of John Paulson. Paulson (no relation to Goldman’s former CEO) would later attain infamy when it was revealed that his firm, Paulson &amp; Co., made roughly $15 billion betting against the mortgage market. (His \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703574604574499740849179448\">personal take\u003c/a> was nearly $4 billion.) At that point, though, Paulson was a little-known hedge fund manager who crossed Goldman’s radar when he asked the firm to create a product that would allow him to take a “short position” on the real estate market — laying down bets that a large number of mortgage investments were going to plummet in value. Goldman sold Paulson what’s called a credit-default swap, essentially an insurance policy that would pay off if homeowners defaulted on their mortgages in large enough numbers. The firm would create several more swaps on his behalf in the intervening months. Eventually, as mortgage defaults began to mount, people inside Goldman Sachs came to see Paulson as more of a prophet than a patsy. Some sitting around the conference table that December day wanted to follow his lead.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“There will be big opportunities the next several months,” one Goldman manager at the meeting wrote enthusiastically in an email sent shortly after it ended. Sparks weighed in by email later that night. He wanted to make sure Goldman had enough “dry powder” — cash on hand — to be “ready for the good opportunities that are coming.” That Sunday, Sparks copied Cohn on an email reporting the firm’s progress on laying down short positions against mortgage-backed securities it had put together. The trading desk had already made $1.5 billion in short bets, “but still more work to do.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Cohn was a member of Goldman’s board of directors during this critical time and second in command of the bank. At that point, Cohn and Blankfein, along with the board and other top executives, had several options. They might have shared their concerns about the mortgage market in a filing with the SEC, which requires publicly traded companies to reveal “triggering events that accelerate or increase a direct financial obligation” or might cause “impairments” to the bottom line. They might have warned clients who had invested in mortgage-backed securities to consider extracting themselves before they suffered too much financial damage. At the very least, Goldman could have stopped peddling mortgage-backed securities that its own mortgage trading desk suspected might soon collapse in value.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Instead, Cohn and his colleagues decided to take care of Goldman Sachs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Goldman would not have suffered the reputational damage that it did — or paid multiple billions in federal fines — if the firm, anticipating the impending crisis, had merely shorted the housing market in the hopes of making billions. That is what investment banks do: spot ways to make money that others don’t see. The money managers and traders featured in the film “The Big Short” did the same — and they were cast as brave contrarians. Yet unlike the investors featured in the film, Goldman had itself helped inflate the housing bubble — buying tens of billions of dollars in subprime mortgages over the previous several years for bundling into bonds they sold to investors. And unlike these investors, Goldman’s people were not warning anyone who would listen about the disaster about to hit. As federal investigations found, the firm, which still claims “our clients’ interests always come first” as a core principle, failed to disclose that its top people saw disaster in the very products its salespeople were continuing to hawk.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Goldman still held billions of mortgages on its books in December 2006 — mortgages that Cohn and other Goldman executives suspected would soon be worth much less than the firm had paid for them. So, while Cohn was overseeing one team inside Goldman Sachs preoccupied with implementing the big short, he was in regular contact with others scrambling to offload its subprime inventory. One Goldman trader described the mortgage-backed securities they were selling as “shitty.” Another complained in an email that they were being asked to “distribute junk that nobody was dumb enough to take first time around.” A December 28 email from Fabrice “Fabulous Fab” Tourre, a Goldman vice president later convicted of fraud, instructed traders to focus on less astute, “buy and hold” investors rather than “sophisticated hedge funds” that “will be on the same side of the trade as we will.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-102551892-1505494640.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-146610\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-102551892-1505494640.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Cohn, president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., right, and Craig Broderick, managing director and head of credit, market and operational risk with Goldman Sachs, are sowrn in during a Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission hearing on the role of derivatives in the financial crisis in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Wednesday, June 30, 2010.

Gary was running the company.” While making his rounds, Cohn would sometimes hike a leg up on a trader’s desk, his crotch practically in the person’s face.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At 6-foot- 2, bullet-headed and bald with a heavy jaw and a fighter’s face, Cohn cut a large figure inside Goldman. Profiles over the years would describe him as aggressive, abrasive, gruff, domineering — the firm’s “attack dog.” He was the missile Blankfein launched when he needed to deliver bad news or enforce discipline. Cohn embodied the new Goldman: the man who would run through a brick wall if it meant a big payoff for the bank.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A Bloomberg profile described his typical day as 11 or 12 hours in the office, a bank-related dinner, then phone calls and emails until midnight. “The old adage that hard work will get you what you want is 100 percent true,” Cohn said in a 2009 commencement address at American University. “Work hard, ask questions, and take risk.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There’s no record of how often Cohn visited his stomping grounds after hours in the early months of 2007, but emails reveal an executive demanding — and getting — regular updates. On February 7, one of the largest originators of subprime loans, HSBC, reported a greater than anticipated rise in troubled loans in its portfolio, and another, New Century, restated its earnings for the previous three quarters to “correct errors.” Sparks wrote an \u003ca href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Financial_Crisis/042710Exhibits.pdf?attempt=2\">email\u003c/a> to Cohn and others the next morning to reassure them that his team was closely monitoring the pricing of the company’s “scratch-and-dent book” and already had a handle on which loans were defaults and which could still be securitized and offloaded onto customers. An impatient Cohn sent a two-word \u003ca href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Financial_Crisis/042710Exhibits.pdf?attempt=2\">email\u003c/a> at 5 o’clock that evening: “Any update?” The next day, an internal memo circulated that listed dozens of mortgage-backed securities with the exhortation, “Let all of the respective desks know how we can be helpful in moving these bonds.” A week later, Sparks updated Cohn on the billions in shorts his firm had bought but warned that it was hurting sales of its “pipeline of CDOs,” the collateralized debt obligations the firm had created in order to sell the mortgages still on its books.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In early March, Cohn was among those who received an email spelling out the mortgage products the firm still held. The stockpile included $1.7 billion in mortgage-related securities, along with $1.3 billion in subprime home loans and $4.3 billion in “Alt-A” loans that fall between prime and subprime on the risk scale. Goldman was “net short,” according to that same email, with $13 billion in short positions, but its exposure to the mortgage market was still considerable. Sparks and others continued to update Cohn on their success offloading securities backed by subprime mortgages through the third quarter of 2007. One product Goldman priced at $94 a share on March 31, 2007 was worth just $15 five months later. Pension funds and insurance companies were among those losing billions of dollars on securities Goldman put together and endorsed as a safe, AAA-rated investments.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-78284727-1505494697.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-146611\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-78284727-1505494697.jpg\" alt=\"US Treasury Secretary Henry M.

A pair of Bear Stearns hedge funds failed. Merrill Lynch reported $2.2 billion in losses — its largest quarterly loss ever. Merrill’s CEO warned that the bank faced another $8 billion in potential losses due to the firm’s exposure to subprime mortgages and resigned several weeks later. The roiling credit crisis also took down the CEO of Citigroup, which reported $6.5 billion in losses and then weeks later, warned of $8 billion to $11 billion in additional subprime-related write-downs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then there was Goldman Sachs, which reported a $2.9 billion profit that quarter. For the moment, the financial press seemed in awe of Blankfein, Cohn, and the rest of the team running the firm. Fortune headlined an article “How Goldman Sachs Defies Gravity” that said Goldman’s “huge, shrewd bet” against the mortgage market “would seem to confirm the view Goldman is the nimblest, and perhaps the smartest, brokerage on Wall Street.” A Goldman press release drily noted that “significant losses” in some areas — the subprime mortgages it hadn’t managed to unload — had been “more than offset by gains on short mortgage products.” A Goldman trader who played a central role in the big short was not so demure when making the case for a big bonus that year. John Paulson was “definitely the man in this space,” he conceded, but he’d helped make Goldman “#1 on the street by a wide margin.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Disaster struck nine months into 2008 with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, in large part the result of its exposure to subprime losses. Hank Paulson, the Treasury secretary and former Goldman CEO, spent a weekend meeting with would-be suitors willing to take over a storied bank that on paper was now worth virtually nothing. He couldn’t find a buyer. Nor could officials from the Federal Reserve, who were also working overtime to save the investment bank, founded in 1850, that was even older than Goldman Sachs. Shortly after midnight on Monday, September 15, 2008, Lehman announced that it would file for bankruptcy protection when the courts in New York opened that morning — the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Goldman Sachs wasn’t immune from the crisis. The week before Lehman’s fall, Goldman’s stock had topped $161 a share. By Wednesday, it dropped to below $100. It had avoided some big losses by betting against the mortgage market, but the wider financial crisis was wreaking havoc on its other investments. On paper, Cohn had personally lost tens of millions of dollars. He hunkered down in an office with a view of Goldman’s trading floor and worked the phone, trying to change the minds of major investors who were pulling their money from Goldman, fearful of anything riskier than stashing their cash in a mattress.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The next week, Goldman \u003ca href=\"https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/goldman-morgan-to-become-bank-holding-companies/comment-page-11/\">converted\u003c/a> from a free-standing investment bank to a bank holding company, which made it, in the eyes of regulators, no different from Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, or any other retail bank. That gave the firm access to cheap capital through the Fed but would also bring increased scrutiny from regulators. The bank took a $10 billion bailout from the Troubled Asset Relief Program and another $5 billion from Warren Buffett, in return for an annual dividend of 10 percent and access to discounted company stock. The firm raised additional billions through a public stock offering.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The biggest threat to Goldman was the economic health of the American International Group. Among other products, AIG sold insurance to protect against defaults on mortgage assets, which had been central to Goldman’s big short. Of the $80 billion in U.S. mortgage assets that AIG insured during the housing bubble, Goldman bought protection from AIG on roughly $33 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal. When Lehman went into bankruptcy, its creditors received 11 cents on the dollar. Executives at AIG, in a frantic effort to avoid bankruptcy, had floated the idea of pushing its creditors to accept 40 to 60 cents on the dollar; there was speculation creditors like Goldman would receive as little as 25 percent. Goldman and its clients were looking at multibillion-dollar hits to their bottom line — a potentially \u003ca href=\"http://fcic-static.law.stanford.edu/cdn_media/fcic-reports/fcic_final_report_full.pdf\">fatal\u003c/a> blow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But as Goldman learned a century ago, it pays to have friends in high places. The day after Lehman went bankrupt, the Bush administration announced an $85 billion bailout of AIG in return for a majority stake in the company. The next day, Paulson obtained a waiver regarding interactions with his former firm because, the Treasury secretary said, “It became clear that we had some very significant issues with Goldman Sachs.” Paulson’s calendar, the New York Times reported, showed that the week of the AIG bailout, he and Blankfein spoke two dozen times. While creditors around the globe were being forced to settle for much less than they were owed, AIG paid its counterparties 100 cents on the dollar. AIG ended up being the single largest private recipient of TARP funding. It received additional billions in rescue funds from the New York Federal Reserve Bank, whose board chair Stephen Friedman was a former Goldman executive who still sat on the firm’s board. The U.S. Treasury ended up with greater than a 90 percent share of AIG, and the U.S. government, using taxpayer dollars, paid in full on the insurance policies financial institutions bought to protect themselves from steep declines in real estate prices — chief among them, Goldman Sachs. All told, Goldman received at least $22.9 billion in public bailouts, including $10 billion in TARP funds and $12.9 billion in taxpayer-funded payments from AIG.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Goldman, once again, had come out on top.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-458388665-1505494750.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-146612\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-458388665-1505494750.jpg\" alt=\"Goldman Sachs Group Inc. headquarters stands in New York, U.S., on Wednesday, Oct. 12, 2016.

Other banks in the U.S. and abroad were still struggling but not Goldman, which reported a record $19.8 billion in pre-tax profits that year, and $12.9 billion the next. Gary Cohn went without a bonus in 2008, left to scrape by on his $600,000 salary. Once free of government interference, the Goldman board (which included Cohn himself) \u003ca href=\"http://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-relations/financials/archived/proxy-statements/docs/2011-proxy-statement.pdf\">paid\u003c/a> him a $9 million bonus in 2009 and an $18 million bonus in 2010.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Yet the once venerated firm was now the subject of jokes on the late-night talk shows. David Letterman broadcast a “Goldman Sachs Top 10 Excuses” list (No. 9: “You’re saying ‘fraud’ like it’s a bad thing.”). Rolling Stone’s Matt Taibbi described the bank as “a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money,” a devastating moniker that followed Goldman into the business pages. After news leaked that the firm might pay its people a record $16.7 billion in bonuses in 2009, even President Barack Obama, for whom the firm had been a top campaign donor, began to turn against Goldman, telling “\u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB126073152465089651\">60 Minutes\u003c/a>,” “I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat-cat bankers on Wall Street.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“They’re still puzzled why is it that people are mad at the banks,” Obama said. “Well, let’s see. You guys are drawing down $10, $20 million bonuses after America went through the worst economic year that it’s gone through in decades, and you guys caused the problem.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Goldman was also facing an onslaught of investigations and lawsuits over behavior that had helped precipitate the financial crisis. Class actions and other lawsuits filed by pension funds and other investors accused Goldman of abusing their trust, making “false and misleading statements,” and failing to conduct basic due diligence on the loans underlying the products it peddled. At least 25 of these suits named Cohn as a defendant.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>State and federal regulators joined the fray. The SEC accused Goldman of deception in its marketing of opaque investments called “synthetic collateralized debt obligations,” the values of which were tied to bundles of actual mortgages. These were the deals Goldman had arranged in 2006 on behalf of John Paulson so he could short the U.S. housing market. Goldman, it turned out, had allowed Paulson to cherry-pick poor-quality loans at the greatest risk of defaulting — a fact Goldman did not share with potential investors. “Goldman wrongly permitted a client that was betting against the mortgage market to heavily influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio,” the SEC’s enforcement director at the time said, “telling other investors that the securities were selected by an independent, objective third party.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Suddenly, Cohn and other Goldman officials were downplaying the big short. In June 2010, Cohn testified before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, created by Congress to investigate the causes of the nation’s worst economic collapse since the Great Depression. Cohn asked the commissioners how anyone could claim the firm had bet against its clients when “during the two years of the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs lost $1.2 billion in its residential mortgage-related business”? His statement was technically true, but Cohn failed to mention the billions of dollars the firm pocketed by betting the mortgage market would collapse. Senate investigators later calculated that, at its peak, Goldman had $13.9 billion in short positions that would only pay off in the event of a steep drop in the mortgage market, positions that produced a record $3.7 billion in profits.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Two weeks after Cohn’s testimony, Goldman agreed to pay the SEC \u003ca href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-123.htm\">$550 million\u003c/a> to settle charges of securities fraud — then the largest penalty assessed against a financial services firm in the agency’s history. Goldman admitted no wrongdoing, acknowledging only that its marketing materials “contained incomplete information.” Goldman paid $60 million in fines and restitution to settle an investigation by the \u003ca href=\"http://www.mass.gov/ago/news-and-updates/press-releases/2009/attorney-general-martha-coakley-and-goldman.html\">Massachusetts\u003c/a> attorney general into the financial backing the firm had offered to predatory mortgage lenders. The bank set aside another \u003ca href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20130116a.htm\">$330 million\u003c/a> to assist people who lost their homes thanks to questionable foreclosure practices at a Goldman loan-servicing subsidiary. Goldman agreed to billions of dollars in additional settlements with state and federal agencies relating to its sale of dicey mortgage-backed securities. The firm finally \u003ca href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/goldman-sachs-agrees-pay-more-5-billion-connection-its-sale-residential-mortgage-backed\">acknowledged\u003c/a> that it had failed to conduct basic due diligence on the loans its was selling customers and, once it became aware of the hazards, did not disclose them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the final report produced by the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Goldman Sachs was mentioned an extraordinary 2,495 times, and Gary Cohn 89 times.

By 2010, the year financial reforms were being drafted, Goldman \u003ca href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000000085&amp;year=2010\">spent\u003c/a> $4.6 million for the services of 49 lobbyists. Their ranks included some of the most well-connected figures in Washington, including Democrat Richard Gephardt, a former House majority leader, and Republican Trent Lott, a former Senate majority leader, who had stepped down from the Senate two years earlier.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Despite all those lobbyists on the payroll, Goldman made its case primarily through proxies during the debate over financial reform. “The name Goldman Sachs was so radioactive it worked to their disadvantage to be tied to an issue,” said Marcus Stanley, then a staffer for Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer and now policy director of Americans for Financial Reform. Instead, Goldman lobbied through industry groups.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Goldman’s people likely knew that all of Wall Street’s lobbying might could not stop the passage of the sprawling 2010 legislative package dubbed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Obama was putting his muscle behind reform — “We simply cannot accept a system in which hedge funds or private equity firms inside banks can place huge, risky bets that are subsidized by taxpayers,” he said in one \u003ca href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/7046668/Barack-Obamas-speech-on-banking-reform-in-full.html\">speech\u003c/a> — and the Democrats enjoyed majorities in both houses of Congress. “For Goldman Sachs, the battle was over the final language,” said Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets, a Washington, D.C., lobby group that pushes for tighter financial reforms. “That way they at least had a fighting chance in the next round, when everyone turned their attention to the regulators.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There was a lot for Goldman Sachs to dislike about Dodd-Frank. There were small annoyances, such as “say on pay,” which ordered companies to give shareholders input on executive compensation, a source of potential embarrassment to a company that gave out $73 million in compensation for a single year’s work — as Goldman paid Cohn in 2007. There were large annoyances, such as the \u003ca href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/designations/Pages/default.aspx#FMU\">requirement\u003c/a> that financial institutions deemed too big to fail, like Goldman, create a wind-down plan in case of disaster. There were the measures that would interfere with Goldman’s core businesses, such as a provision instructing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to regulate the trading of derivatives. And yet nothing mattered to Goldman quite like the Volcker Rule, which would protect banks’ solvency by limiting their freedom to make speculative trades with their own money. Unless Goldman could initiate what Stanley called the “complexity two-step” — win a carve-out so a new rule wouldn’t interfere with legitimate business and then use that carve-out to render a rule toothless — Volcker would slam the door shut on the entire direction in which Blankfein and Cohn had taken Goldman.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It was 5:30 a.m. on Friday, June 25, 2010, when a joint House-Senate conference committee \u003ca href=\"https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/111th-congress/house-report/517\">approved\u003c/a> the final language of Dodd-Frank. By Sunday, an industry attorney named Annette Nazareth — a former top SEC official whose firm counts Goldman Sachs among its clients — had already sent off a heavily annotated copy of the 848-page bill to colleagues at her old agency. It was just the first salvo in a lobbying juggernaut.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Within a few months, Cohn himself was in Washington to \u003ca href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/rr-commpublic/Goldman_Sachs_meeting_20101004.pdf\">meet\u003c/a> with a governor of the Federal Reserve, one of the key agencies charged with implementing Volcker. The visitors log at the CFTC, the agency Dodd-Frank put in charge of derivatives reform, shows that Cohn traveled to D.C. to personally meet with CFTC staffers at least six times between 2010 and 2016. Cohn also came to the capital for meetings at the SEC, another agency responsible for the Volcker Rule. There, he met with SEC chair Mary Jo White and other commissioners. “I seem to be in Washington every week trying to explain to them the unintended consequences of overregulation,” Cohn said in a talk he gave to business students at Sacred Heart University in 2015.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Gary was the tip of the spear for Goldman to beat back regulatory reform,” said Kelleher, the financial reform lobbyist. “I used to pass him going into different agencies. They brought him in when they wanted the big gun to finish off, to kill the wounded.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Democrats lost their majority in the House that November, and Goldman threw its weight behind the spate of Republican bills that followed, aimed at taking apart Dodd-Frank piece by piece. Goldman spent more than $4 million for the services of 45 lobbyists in 2011 and $3.5 million a year in 2012 and 2013. Its lobbying spending was nearly as high in the years after passage of Dodd-Frank as it was the year the bill was introduced.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Goldman lobbyists dug in on a range of issues that would become top priorities for Republicans in the wake of Donald Trump’s electoral victory. Records from the Center for Responsive Politics show that Goldman lobbyists worked to promote corporate tax cuts, such as on the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 and Senate legislation aimed at extending some $200 billion in tax cuts for individuals and businesses. Goldman lobbied for a bill to fund economically critical infrastructure projects, presumably on behalf of its Public Sector and Infrastructure group. Goldman had seven lobbyists working on the JOBS Act, which would make it easier for companies to go public, another bottom-line issue to a company that underwrote $27 billion in IPOs last year. In 2016, Goldman had eight lobbyists dedicated to the Financial CHOICE Act, which would have undone most of Dodd-Frank in one fell swoop — a bill the House revived in April.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Yet defanging the Volcker Rule remained the firm’s top priority. Promoted by former Fed Chair Paul Volcker, the rule would prohibit banks from committing more than 3 percent of their core assets to in-house private equity and hedge funds in the business of buying up properties and businesses with the goal of selling them at a profit. One harbinger of the financial crisis had been the collapse in the summer of 2007 of a pair of Bear Stearns hedge funds that had invested heavily in subprime loans. That 3 percent cap would have had a big impact on Goldman, which maintained a separate private equity group and operated its own internal hedge funds. But it was the restrictions Volcker placed on proprietary trading that most threatened Goldman.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prop trading was a profit center inside many large banks, but nowhere was it as critical as at Goldman. A 2011 report by one Wall Street analyst revealed that prop trading accounted for an 8 percent share of JPMorgan Chase’s annual revenues, 9 percent of Bank of America’s, and 27 percent of Morgan Stanley’s. But prop trading made up 48 percent of Goldman’s. By one \u003ca href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-goldman-volcker-idUSTRE7434PZ20110505\">estimate\u003c/a>, the Volcker Rule could cost Goldman Sachs $3.7 billion in revenue a year.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When regulators finalized a new Volcker Rule in 2013, Better Markets declared it a “major defeat for Wall Street.” Yet the victory for reformers was precarious. “Just changing a few words could dramatically change the scope of the rule — to the tune of billions of dollars for some firms,” said former Senate staffer Tyler Gellasch, who helped write the rule. Volcker gave banks until July 2015 — the five-year anniversary of Dodd-Frank — to bring themselves into compliance. Yet apparently the Volcker Rule had been written for other financial institutions, not elite firms like Goldman Sachs. “Goldman Sachs has been on a shopping spree with its own money,” began a New York Times article in January 2015. The bank used its own funds to buy a mall in Utah, apartments in Spain, and a European ink company. Paul Volcker expressed disappointment that banks were still making big proprietary bets, as did the two senators most responsible for writing the rule into law. That June, Cohn appeared to reassure investors that Goldman would find a workaround. Speaking at an investor conference, he said Goldman was “transforming our equity investing activities to continue to meet client needs while complying with Volcker.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Goldman had five years to prepare for some version of a Volcker Rule. Yet a loophole granted banks sufficient time to dispose of “illiquid assets” without causing undue harm — a loophole that might even cover the assets Goldman had only recently purchased, despite the impending compliance deadline. The Fed nonetheless granted the firm additional time to sell illiquid investments worth billions of dollars. “Goldman is brilliant at exercising access and influence without fingerprints,” Kelleher said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>By mid-2016, Goldman, along with Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase, was petitioning the Fed for an additional five years to comply with Volcker — which would take the banks well into a new administration. All Blankfein and Cohn had to do was wait for a new Congress and a new president who might back their efforts to flush all of Dodd-Frank. Then Goldman could continue the risky and lucrative habits it had adopted since traders like Cohn had taken over the firm — the financial crisis be damned — and continue raking in billions in profits each year.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-456025502-1505494804.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-146614\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-456025502-1505494804.jpg\" alt=\"Lloyd Blankfein, Chairman &amp; CEO, Goldman Sachs (L) stands on stage with former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the 2014 Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting in New York September 24, 2014.

Dating back to at least 1990, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, people associated with the firm and its political action committees \u003ca href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/totals.php?id=d000000085&amp;cycle=2012\">contributed\u003c/a> more to Democrats than Republicans. Yet in the years since financial reform, Goldman, once Obama’s second-largest political donor, shifted its campaign contributions to Republicans. During the 2008 election cycle, for instance, Goldman’s people and PACs contributed $4.8 million to Democrats and $1.7 million to Republicans. By the 2012 cycle, the opposite happened, with Goldman giving $5.6 million to Republicans and $1.8 million to Democrats. Cohn’s personal giving followed the same path. Cohn gave $26,700 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 2006 and $55,500 during the 2008 election cycle, and none to its GOP equivalent. But Cohn donated $30,800 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee in 2012 and another $33,400 to the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2015, without contributing a dime to the DSCC. Cohn gave $5,000 to Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown weeks after news broke that Elizabeth Warren — an outspoken critic of Goldman and other Wall Street players — might try to capture his U.S. Senate seat, which she did in 2012.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Goldman Sachs, under Cohn and Blankfein, was hardly chastened, continuing to play fast and loose with existing rules even as it plunged millions of dollars into fending off new ones. In 2010, the SEC ran a sting operation looking for banks willing to trade favorable assessments by its stock analysts for a piece of a Toys R Us IPO if the company went public. Goldman took the bait, for which they would pay a $5 million fine. An employee working out of Goldman’s Boston office drafted speeches, vetted a running mate, and negotiated campaign contracts for the state treasurer during his run for Massachusetts governor in 2010, despite a rule forbidding municipal bond dealers from making significant political contributions to officials who can award them business. According to the SEC, Goldman had underwritten $9 billion in bonds for Massachusetts in the previous two years, generating $7.5 million in fees. Goldman paid $12 million to settle the matter in 2012.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Just two years later, Goldman officials were again summoned by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to address charges that the bank under Cohn and Blankfein had boosted its profits by building a “virtual monopoly” in order to inflate aluminum prices by as much as $3 billion.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The last few years have brought more unwanted attention. In 2015, the U.S. Justice Department launched an investigation into Goldman’s role in the alleged theft of billions of dollars from a development fund the firm had helped create for the government of Malaysia. Federal regulators in New York state fined Goldman $50 million because its leaders failed to effectively supervise a banker who leaked stolen confidential government information from the Fed, which \u003ca href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/enforcement20160803a.htm\">hit the firm\u003c/a> with another $36.3 million in penalties. In December, the CFTC \u003ca href=\"http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr7505-16\">fined\u003c/a> Goldman $120 million for trying to rig interest rates to profit the firm.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Politically, 2016 would prove a strange year for Goldman. Bernie Sanders clobbered Hillary Clinton for pocketing hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees from Goldman, while Trump attacked Ted Cruz for being “in bed with” Goldman Sachs. (Cruz’s wife Heidi was a managing director in Goldman’s Houston office until she took leave to work on her husband’s presidential campaign.) Goldman would have “total control” over Clinton, Trump \u003ca href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/19/politics/donald-trump-ted-cruz-goldman-sachs/\">said\u003c/a> at a February 2016 rally, a point his campaign reinforced in a two-minute ad that ran the weekend before Election Day. An image of Blankfein flashed across the screen as Trump warned about the global forces that “robbed our working class.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Goldman’s giving in the presidential race appears to reflect polls predicting a Clinton win and the firm’s desire for a political restart on deregulation. People who identified themselves as Goldman Sachs employees \u003ca href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2017/03/revolving-door-goldman-sachs/\">gave less than $5,000\u003c/a> to the Trump campaign compared to the $341,000 that the firm’s people and PACs \u003ca href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=n00000019\">contributed\u003c/a> to Clinton. Goldman Sachs is relatively small compared to retail banking giants.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Yet, according to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2017/03/revolving-door-goldman-sachs/\">Center for Responsive Politics\u003c/a>, no bank outspent Goldman Sachs during the 2016 political cycle. Its PACs and people associated with the firm made $5.6 million in political contributions in 2015 and 2016. Even including all donations to Clinton, 62 percent of Goldman’s giving ended up in the coffers of Republican candidates, parties, or conservative outside groups.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-675487028-1505498812.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-146628\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-675487028-1505498812.jpg\" alt=\"WASHINGTON, DC - MAY 01:  (AFP-OUT) U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to community bankers as Director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn (2nd R) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus (R) listen druing an event at the Kennedy Garden of the White House May 1, 2017 in Washington, DC.

There’s the high regard the president holds for anyone who is rich — and the instant legitimacy Cohn conferred upon the administration within business circles. Cohn’s appointment reassured bond markets about the unpredictable new president and lent his administration credibility it lacked among Fortune 100 CEOs, none of whom had donated to his campaign. Ego may also have played a role. Goldman Sachs would never do business with Trump, the developer who resorted to foreign banks and second-tier lenders to bankroll his projects. Now Goldman’s president would be among those serving in his royal court.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Who can say precisely why Cohn, a Democrat, said yes when Trump asked him to be his top economic aide? No doubt Cohn has been asking himself that question in recent weeks. But he’d hit a ceiling at Goldman Sachs. In September 2015, Goldman announced that Blankfein had lymphoma, ramping up speculation that Cohn would take over the firm. Yet four months later, after undergoing chemotherapy, Blankfein was back in his office and plainly not going anywhere. Cohn was 56 years old when he was invited to Trump Tower. An influential job inside the White House meant a face-saving exit — and one offering a huge financial advantage.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trump spoke of the great financial price Cohn paid to join him in the White House during his speech in Cedar Rapids. But something like the opposite was true. A huge amount of Cohn’s wealth was tied up in Goldman stock. By entering government, he could sell his stake in the firm to comply with federal ethics laws. That way he could diversify his holdings and avoid roughly $50 million in capital gains taxes —  at least until he sold the replacement assets.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A job in the White House might also prove an outlet for his frustrations with politicians and regulators intent on reining in the worst impulses of Wall Street. Trump was Trump, but he had also vowed to dismantle financial reform. “Dodd-Frank has made it impossible for bankers to function,” Trump said during the campaign. The new president had the potential to serve as a vessel for Goldman’s corporate interests.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Maybe the one thing that holds this administration together is a belief that markets know best, and the least regulation is the best regulation,” said Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets. “Goldman’s interests fit with that very nicely.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-695306024-1505498862.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-146629\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-695306024-1505498862.jpg\" alt=\"WASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 12:  U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin testifies before the House Appropriations Committee's Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill June 12, 2017 in Washington, DC.

But taking over as Treasury secretary meant being confirmed by the Senate. Mnuchin’s confirmation vote was delayed after it was revealed that he’d neglected to list $95 million in assets (including homes in New York, Los Angeles, and the Hamptons) on his Senate Finance Committee disclosure forms and failed to disclose his ties to an offshore hedge fund registered in the Cayman Islands. Mnuchin was not confirmed until mid-February. The president’s pick for commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, a financier who had bailed out several of Trump’s casinos a few decades earlier, was not confirmed until the end of February.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As a presidential aide, Cohn did not need Senate approval. He was part of the skeletal crew that arrived at the White House on day one, giving him a critical head start on wielding his clout and cultivating his relationship with the new president. At that point, Trump was summoning Cohn to the Oval Office for impromptu meetings as many as \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/11/business/dealbook/trump-economic-cabinet-gary-cohn.html?_r=0\">five times a day\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In early February, Trump signed an executive order giving his Treasury secretary 120 days to give him a hit list of regulations the administration could eliminate. But with Mnuchin yet to be confirmed, the task appeared to land in Cohn’s eager hands. He was standing at the president’s shoulder when Trump said, “We expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank.” Shares in Goldman Sachs, which had jumped by 28 percent after the election, rose another $6 a share that day. Soon Cohn was coordinating Trump’s plans not only for rolling back regulations, but also for creating jobs and slashing taxes. He met with a health care specialist, along with House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republican leaders, to discuss alternatives to the Affordable Care Act.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Proximity is power inside any White House, especially in this one, where policy often seems shaped by Trump’s last conversation. Treasury is several blocks away, while Cohn’s office was in the West Wing, directly across the hall from Bannon’s. Operating within a chaotic administration, Cohn was \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/11/business/dealbook/trump-economic-cabinet-gary-cohn.html?_r=0\">reportedly\u003c/a> energized and focused, working around the clock. Cohn is a tenacious practitioner who, after ascending to the heights of Goldman Sachs, could teach a master class on the art of seizing a leadership vacuum and building alliances. On day 39 of the new administration, the White House sent out a press release introducing the “best-in-class team” Cohn had assembled “to drive President Trump’s bold plan for job creation and economic growth.” The 13 advisers included familiar figures who had worked for George W. Bush or his father, but they also included at least three former lobbyists so conflicted they would need an ethics waiver to work in the White House. For instance, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/15/us/politics/trump-appointees-potential-conflicts.html?mcubz=1&amp;_r=1\">Michael Catanzaro\u003c/a>, the man Cohn chose to oversee energy policy, was until last year a lobbyist for such oil, gas, and coal companies as Devon Energy and Talen Energy. Shahira Knight had been a lobbyist for Fidelity, the mutual fund giant, before joining Cohn’s team.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Cohn’s strategy in those early months was to make himself indispensable to the new president. Cohn emerged as one of the few people around Trump comfortable interrupting him during a meeting or openly disagreeing on points of policy. The New York Times reported that Trump often turned to Cohn during a meeting and asked him directly, “What do you want to do?” Early on, Trump referred to Cohn as “one of my geniuses” — a quote Reuters attributed to a “source close to Cohn.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Soon, major media were painting Cohn as a leading centrist inside the Trump White House because he had staked out positions on immigration, international alliances, and global warming at odds with Bannon’s hard-right nationalism. Bannon and his allies only bolstered this narrative by characterizing “Carbon Tax Cohn” and his allies, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, as interlopers — “the Democrats,” as some inside the White House called them. “Within Trump’s Inner Circle, a Moderate Voice Captures the President’s Ear,” read the headline of a Cohn profile in the Washington Post.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Led by Gary Cohn and Dina Powell — two former Goldman Sachs executives often aligned with Trump’s elder daughter and his son-in-law — the group and its broad network of allies are the targets of suspicion, loathing and jealousy from their more ideological West Wing colleagues,” the Washington Post reported. Fueling the rage of the ideologues, Cohn and his allies were largely winning. Trump dropped Bannon from the National Security Council and elevated Powell to deputy national security adviser. When, after Charlottesville, false reports leaked that Cohn was so disgusted with the president he was resigning, blue-chip stocks slid down. Instead, Bannon was out. Cohn, despite reports that he invoked Trump’s wrath for critical remarks to the Financial Times, was still in and expected to deliver the president a win on corporate taxes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-678802232-1505498930.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-146631\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-678802232-1505498930.jpg\" alt=\"National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn arrives at a Wall Street Heliport while traveling with US President Donald Trump May 4, 2017 in New York, New York. / AFP PHOTO / Brendan Smialowski        (Photo credit should read BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images)\" />\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption overlayed\">National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn arrives at a Wall Street heliport while traveling with President Donald Trump on May 4, 2017 in New York City.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class='caption source pullright' style=''>Photo: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\n\u003cp>On the day it was announced that he was joining the Trump administration, Cohn said on a goodbye podcast for Goldman Sachs, “You look at the size of our capital.

You look at the size of our people — it’s just enormous.” More than $40 billion had flowed into the bank in 2016, bringing the bank’s assets under management to a record $1.38 trillion. That meant pressure to find ways to put that money to work — an enormous challenge if regulators finally shut down Goldman’s prop trading arm.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>How exactly could Cohn recuse himself from matters involving Goldman when almost every aspect of his job has the potential to either grow Goldman’s profits and inflate its stock price — or tank them both?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“To the extent Goldman Sachs is a direct party in a matter, Gary will recuse himself,” a source familiar with the situation said. But, the source added, “As NEC director, Gary is going to touch on matters on the day-to-day economy as a whole and Goldman Sachs is a participant in the economy, thus Gary will indirectly touch on things that affect Goldman Sachs along with other banks and institutions.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Yet rather than publicly recuse himself on attempts to undo Dodd-Frank, Cohn has led the charge from inside the White House. On that matter, Cohn is a walking, talking \u003ca href=\"https://www.oge.gov/web/oge.nsf/Financial+Conflicts+of+Interest\">conflict of interest\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While at Goldman, Cohn had personally met with officials at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to discuss the derivatives reform plank of Dodd-Frank, an arena in which Goldman is a dominant player. He had taken issue with rules imposed by Dodd-Frank that require banks to keep more capital on hand. Requiring banks to hold more money in reserve made them “unequivocally” safer than before 2008, he said in a 2015 interview while still Goldman’s president, but he complained that Goldman was now able to lend less money, hurting profits. And then there’s the Volcker Rule. Cohn, while still president of the firm, had traveled to D.C. at least twice to personally lobby regulators about its implementation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>These days, it can be hard to tell whether Cohn is speaking as a high-ranking White House official or a former Goldman Sachs executive.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the wake of Trump’s February call for a rollback in financial regulations, Cohn vowed in an interview with Bloomberg TV, “We’re going to attack \u003cem>all\u003c/em> aspects of Dodd-Frank.” The first example he gave: the Volcker Rule, which he cast as harmful to the country’s competitive advantage. In an \u003ca href=\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2017/02/03/dodd-frank-do-over-win-for-banks-trump-advisor-gary-cohn.html\">interview\u003c/a> that same day with Fox Business, he homed in on another Goldman obsession: Dodd-Frank’s capital requirements. “Banks are forced to hoard money because they are forced to hoard capital, and they can’t take any risks,” he said. Mortgage, auto, credit card lending, and commercial lending are all up since 2010. Yet Cohn told Fox viewers, “We need to get banks back in the lending business, that’s our No. 1 objective.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Roy Smith, a former Goldman partner now teaching at the NYU Stern School of Business, argues that Cohn should avoid the administration’s effort to unwind Dodd-Frank altogether, but “at a very minimum he has to excuse himself whenever the discussion turns to Volcker.” But Smith said he has trouble imagining Cohn leaving the room when Volcker comes up. “The hard part for someone like Cohn is that he knows where all the pain points are with Volcker and other parts of Dodd-Frank,” Smith said. “His every instinct would be to get involved.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Beyond deregulation, two other pillars of Trump’s economic plan — cutting taxes and investing in infrastructure — would have dramatic impacts on Goldman’s bottom line.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Thanks to loopholes, many Fortune 500 corporations pay \u003ca href=\"https://americansfortaxfairness.org/tax-fairness-briefing-booklet/fact-sheet-corporate-tax-rates/\">little or no\u003c/a> corporate income tax at all. By contrast, Goldman Sachs typically pays taxes near the official 35 percent federal tax rate. In 2014, for instance, Goldman paid $3.9 billion in taxes on profits of $12.4 billion, or 31 percent. Last year, the firm’s tax bill was $2.7 billion on profits of $10.3 billion, or 28 percent. In that same Fox Business interview, Cohn said that “lower corporate taxes” was the White House’s “starting point” on tax reform; cuts to personal income taxes were a secondary concern.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Under the plan Cohn and Mnuchin announced last spring, what Cohn called “one of the biggest tax cuts in the American history,” corporate taxes would be capped at 15 percent. If Cohn succeeds, Goldman will save massive sums: At that rate, Goldman would have paid $2 billion less in taxes in 2014, $1.4 billion less in 2015, and $1.4 billion less in 2016. The Koch brothers’ network of political groups has already spent millions of dollars to promote the proposal. Even Blankfein, who the Trump campaign singled out in the commercial it ran in the final days of the campaign, \u003ca href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-goldman-sachs-trump-idUSKBN1352KH\">acknowledged\u003c/a> in a voicemail to employees that Trump’s commitment to tax cuts, deregulation, and infrastructure “will be good for our clients and our firm.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The details of the president’s “$1 trillion” infrastructure plan are similarly favorable to Goldman. As laid out in the administration’s 2018 budget, the government would spend only $200 billion on infrastructure over the coming decade. By structuring “that funding to incentivize additional non-Federal funding” — tax breaks and deals that privatize roads, bridges, and airports — the government could take credit for “at least $1 trillion in total infrastructure spending,” the budget reads.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It was as if Cohn were still channeling his role as a leader of Goldman Sachs when, at the White House in May, he offered this advice to executives: “We say, ‘Hey, take a project you have right now, sell it off, privatize it, we know it will get maintained, and we’ll reward you for privatizing it.’” “The bigger the thing you privatize, the more money we’ll give you,” \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/trump-advisers-call-for-selling-off-old-assets-to-build-new-infrastructure/2017/05/23/657aa2c6-2f53-11e7-9534-00e4656c22aa_story.html?utm_term=.973cbdc4eb53\">continued\u003c/a> Cohn. By “we,” he clearly meant the federal government; by “you,” he appeared to be speaking, at least in part, about Goldman Sachs, whose Public Sector and Infrastructure group \u003ca href=\"http://www.goldmansachs.com/what-we-do/investment-banking/industry-sectors/municipal-finance/\">arranges\u003c/a> the financing on large-scale public sector deals. “Goldman Sachs is one of the largest infrastructure fund managers globally,” according to infrastructure advisory firm \u003ca href=\"http://www.infrapppworld.com/company/goldman-sachs-infrastructure-partners-gsip\">InfraPPP Partners\u003c/a>, “having raised more than $10 billion of capital since the inception of the business in 2006.” Lost in the infamous press conference the president gave in the lobby of Trump Tower a few days after Charlottesville, with Cohn and Mnuchin visibly uncomfortable at his right flank, were Trump’s remarks on infrastructure, the ostensible purpose of the event. The thrust was that the president would grease the wheels for project approvals by signing an executive order rolling back environmental impact requirements and other elements of an “overregulated permitting process.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In countless other ways, Cohn is positioned to help the firm that has been so good to him over the years. The country’s National Economic Council adviser might caution a president against running too large a deficit, especially amid a healthy economy. But Goldman Sachs is in the business of finding investors to underwrite government debt. An economic adviser might caution a populist president that corporate inversions often cost jobs and tax revenue. Instead, Trump has ordered a review of policies Obama put in place to discourage them — good news for Cohn’s former colleagues. Transparency has been a watchword of initial public offerings dating back at least to the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, but easing those rules, a step Goldman has sought, could potentially generate hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for investment banks such as Goldman. The SEC announced in June that it would allow any company going public to withhold details of its finances and strategies, an exemption previously available only to firms with under $1 billion in revenue — more good tidings for Goldman. Just loosening the rules for IPOs, said Tyler Gellasch, the former Senate staffer, “could mean hundreds of millions of dollars more to Goldman.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In June, the Treasury Department released a statement of principles about the administration’s approach to financial regulation focused on promoting “liquid and vibrant markets.” Not surprisingly, the report included a call to ease capital requirements and substantially amend the Volcker Rule.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It’s Cohn’s influence over the country’s regulators that worries Dennis Kelleher, the financial reform lobbyist. “To him, what’s good for Wall Street is good for the economy,” Kelleher said of Cohn. “Maybe that makes sense when a guy has spent 26 years at Goldman, a company who has repaid his loyalties and sweat with a net worth in the hundreds of millions.” Kelleher recalls those who lost a home or a chunk of their retirement savings during a financial crisis that Cohn helped precipitate. “They’re still suffering,” he said. “Yet now Cohn’s in charge of the economy and talking about eliminating financial reform and basically putting the country back to where it was in 2005, as if 2008 didn’t happen. I’ve started the countdown clock to the next financial crash, which will make the last one look mild.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>This article was reported in partnership with The Investigative Fund at The Nation Institute.\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">Top photo: National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin (R) take questions about tax cuts and reform during a briefing at the White House on April 26, 2017 in Washington, D.C.\u003c/p>\n","credit_additional_reporting":"","credit_additional_reporting_users_object":"","credit_photo_illustration":"","credit_research":"","credit_research_users_object":"","credit_translation":"","credit_translation_users_object":"","date":"2017-09-17T12:00:34+00:00","date_local":"2017-09-17T08:00:34+00:00","documents":"","excerpt":"At Goldman Sachs, Gary Cohn nearly wrecked the economy.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had finalized a \u003ca href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/policy-compliance/rulemaking/final-rules/arbitration-agreements/\">landmark new rule\u003c/a> in July banning the forced arbitration provisions that banks and credit card companies commonly tuck into the fine print of agreements, barring their customers from joining class-action suits. House Republicans quickly voted to nullify the new rule, but weeks later, with a deadline looming, it was still unclear if the Senate would act in time. After intense pressure from industry and the Trump administration, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was finally able to muster 50 votes, and Pence was parachuted in to break a 50-50 tie. Politico called the vote “a blow to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau” and “Republicans’ most far-reaching victory yet this year in their effort to roll back financial regulations.” CFPB Director Richard Cordray was even more blunt: “Wall Street won and ordinary people lost.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The rule’s spectacular defeat marked a rare Wall Street victory over an agency created by Dodd-Frank, the sweeping financial reform law Barack Obama signed in 2010. The CFPB was barely five years old when Donald Trump was elected, promising to “do a number” on financial regulations. Just weeks into the new presidency, Sen. Ted Cruz declared the CFPB “an out-of-control bureaucracy” and introduced a one-page bill to abolish it outright. McConnell, then minority leader, had told a gathering of bankers in 2013, “If I had my way, we wouldn’t have the agency at all.” A dead or severely injured CFPB seemed a certainty in those early days. If nothing else, surely Cordray would get pink-slipped. “It’s time to fire King Richard,” exclaimed Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., shortly before Trump’s inauguration.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Yet Cordray is departing on his own terms, amid speculation that he will run for governor of Ohio. He announced on Wednesday that he expects to step down before the end of the month, and when he does, he’ll leave behind a vibrant, if profoundly embattled, agency.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>His departure will be “a huge loss,” said Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform. If Trump appoints a new director who is indifferent, or even hostile, to consumer issues, she said, “It will be incredibly costly to the American public.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This past summer, Cheklist, a trade magazine for check cashers and payday lenders, published a cover story about the frustration roiling fringe financial players. The CFPB was still a “nettlesome bureau,” its editor wrote, and not a single bill aimed at weakening the bureau had reached the president’s desk. Meanwhile, its aggressive enforcement actions against \u003ca href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-takes-action-against-national-collegiate-student-loan-trusts-transworld-systems-illegal-student-loan-debt-collection-lawsuits/\">debt collectors\u003c/a>, \u003ca href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-takes-actions-against-credit-repair-companies-charging-illegal-fees-and-misleading-consumers/\">credit repair companies\u003c/a>, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-sues-four-online-lenders-collecting-debts-consumers-did-not-legally-owe/\">online payday lenders\u003c/a> were continuing unabated. Just three weeks before Congress reversed the arbitration rule, the CFPB finalized \u003ca href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-finalizes-rule-stop-payday-debt-traps/\">another new rule\u003c/a> that tightened restrictions around high-interest, small-dollar loans to stop what Cordray called “payday debt traps.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Yet it’s not just smaller financial players who have felt cheated over the past year. Richard Hunt, who has been paid more than $1 million a year  by the Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group representing the country’s largest banks, including Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and JPMorgan Chase, expressed delight after the Senate killed the “ill-conceived” ban on mandatory arbitration clauses. But mostly, his organization has been left expressing disappointment. Thoughts of halting the CFPB have been replaced by angry pronouncements about its unregulated powers. “It’s a fact,” Hunt said in an interview. “It’s the most unaccountable agency in our government, period.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In fact, the CFPB has emerged as that rare beast — a fast-moving agency that actually chalks up wins for average Americans. By the end of 2016, shortly before Trump took office, the 5 1/2 -year-old bureau’s enforcement actions against everyone from the country’s biggest banks to small-time debt collectors had already returned $11.9 billion to 29 million consumers. The CFPB had created a public database of consumer complaints against banks and other lenders, and had issued new rules governing everything from mortgages to student loans to the prepaid cards that millions of “unbanked” Americans carry in their wallets. A year ago, the bureau finalized new rules giving prepaid customers some of the same protections enjoyed by those who use credit cards.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Through its complaint database, the CFPB has secured redress for more than 160,000 individual complainants, such as Gene DeSantis, a former TD Bank customer near Albany, New York. DeSantis, a consumer lawyer himself, nevertheless registered one of the 800,000-plus complaints the CFPB has received. While he was away for the winter, DeSantis had mail forwarded to his Utah home. But TD, he found, does not forward its bills unless a customer contacts the bank directly, even when a customer like DeSantis has arranged for the post office to do so, and so he missed a payment. After a surprise call from a debt collector, DeSantis said he called customer service but “never got anywhere.” Meanwhile, his late charges ballooned to $235 on his $136 missed payment. “If a person like me is rendered helpless, God forbid what the average person faces,” DeSantis said. Within a week of filing his CFPB complaint, TD dropped interest and penalties. (A TD spokesperson declined to comment on the bank’s refusal to waive the fees until the CFPB got involved.)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Because of the bureau,” said Mike Calhoun, president of the Center for Responsible Lending, “we’ve gone from, ‘Where does it say I can’t do that?’ to ‘You have a duty to treat customers fairly.’”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Even without Cordray at the helm, the problem that confronts Hunt and his frenemies running other financial industry trade associations is that the CFPB is simply too popular to eliminate. A \u003ca href=\"http://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/topline.AFRCRL.timeseries.f.2017.07.24.pdf\">2017 poll by Americans for Financial Reform and the Center for Responsible Lending\u003c/a> showed that 78 percent of likely voters believe we need tough rules and enforcement to prevent another financial crisis. Even among Republicans the ratio was 2-to-1. A \u003ca href=\"http://gpg.com/gpg-survey-trump-voters-december-2016/\">poll conducted at the end of 2016\u003c/a> showed that, by that same 2-to-1 margin, Trump voters want the bureau left alone or strengthened. Its popularity seems to be one reason the White House has not waged the frontal war on the CFPB that its allies so sorely wanted. With Wells Fargo and Equifax exploding in scandal and their CEOs marched before Congress, anger toward Wall Street is almost as strong on the right as it is on the left. How, in that context, do you shut down an agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Industry’s answer has been a multimillion dollar, multi-front battle to discredit and defang the bureau, a war declared even before the enemy officially existed. Almost immediately after Dodd-Frank became law, a robust opposition had formed that included elected officials, trade associations, lobbyists, lawyers, think tanks, and front groups. In the intervening years, attacking the CFPB has become a growth industry in Washington. Hyperbolic, relentless, often scorchingly personal — it’s a campaign that more often than not resembles a street fight. Now the agency is vulnerable and soon to be in the hands of a Trump appointee who could attempt to unwind the constructive work that took place under Cordray, says Donner. “There is a lot at stake,” she said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'>\u003cbr />\n\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/11/Elizabeth-Warren-toned-1510862921.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-158414\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/11/Elizabeth-Warren-toned-1510862921-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Warren, center, Special Asst. to the Treasury Secretary on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, speaks during a photo opportunity on the occasion of the anniversary of the Dodd-Frank Bill as Rep.

The federal government has a Consumer Product Safety Commission that develops uniform safety standards and has the power to ban or recall items posing unreasonable safety risks. Why not a Financial Product Safety Commission, Warren asked in a \u003ca href=\"https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/5/unsafe-at-any-rate/\">2007 paper\u003c/a>,  that protects people from any “tricks and traps” that mortgage lenders, credit card companies, and other financial institutions might bake into their products? The financial crisis hit the next year, adding urgency to her proposal. In 2010, shortly after signing Dodd-Frank, Obama hired Warren as a special adviser. Her job: to hire people and start building the agency she had only imagined three years earlier. “David can beat Goliath — that’s the meaning of Dodd-Frank,” she said in 2015.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The CFPB receives money directly from the Federal Reserve, which is funded in part by the banks it oversees. So it has never been vulnerable to congressional budget cuts. Yet from the start, working for the bureau meant contending with congressional inquiries, legal challenges, and a constant barrage of document requests from conservative quarters. “There was a whole office within the general counsel’s office to deal with nothing but this stuff,” said Deepak Gupta, a crusading consumer lawyer Warren chose to serve as the agency’s top litigator. A “war room,” Gupta called it. Another early employee, Rohit Chopra, whom Warren had put in charge of the private student loan market, described life then as having polite conversations with representatives of companies “while they were putting all these resources into having their lobbyists and lawyers try to burn the place down.” In March 2011, the Wall Street Journal denounced Warren and the bureau three times in a single week — four months before the CFPB had opened its doors.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Chopra’s job within the agency was to advocate on behalf of private student-loan borrowers, who often paid interest rates more than twice as high as those carrying government student loans. Pressure he applied resulted in the end of several onerous practices by lenders, such as demanding full repayment on student loans if the parent who co-signed the loan died. He also won $60 million in refunds for military families overcharged on student loans. Outspoken in his criticisms of the industry, he soon learned how quickly things could turn personal. Hunt, whose trade group represents some of the largest private student lenders, described Chopra as a “bad apple” and “borderline sinister.” Hunt had his chance to lash out at his adversary in a \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/cfpbs-ombudsman-speaks-loudly-on-student-loans-1417651649\">Wall Street Journal article\u003c/a> about what the newspaper called Chopra’s “hard-charging style.” That story even dredged up an issue of the Harvard Crimson from his time as student body president, in which Chopra said, “A kind of adversarial relationship is necessary.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Democrats lost their majority in the House of Representatives at the start of 2011. Since that time, the House has functioned as the front line in the fight against the bureau. Its command center is the House Financial Services Committee, which, Gupta says, “is like an arm of the banking industry.” Jeb Hensarling, a free-market libertarian representing the eastern suburbs of Dallas, has chaired the committee since 2013, when he replaced a more moderate, business-friendly Republican. Hensarling and his allies have attacked Cordray with the sustained vigor of the Benghazi hearings. “The CFPB stands with Obamacare as a crowning ‘achievement’ of Mr. Obama’s transformation of America,” Hensarling wrote earlier this year in a \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-well-stop-a-rogue-federal-agency-1486597413\">Wall Street Journal op-ed\u003c/a> headlined, “How We’ll Stop a Rogue Federal Agency.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When he was first assigned to the committee, Sean Duffy, a freshman representative from rural Wisconsin best known for appearing on an MTV reality television show (“The Real World: Boston”), confessed he “wasn’t very familiar” with banking issues. Yet within a few months, he declared the CFPB a “rogue agency” and introduced legislation to weaken its rule-making powers. Since 2011, Duffy has received $2.9 million in campaign contributions from the financial sector, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. “Say bad things about the CFPB,” said Gupta, and watch the money roll in. “It’s like a cash cow for them.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In 2014, Duffy was named chair of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, which has emerged as the prime beachhead for lobbing grenades at the CFPB.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Since 2011, Republicans have introduced 135 bills and resolutions aimed at killing or weakening the CFPB in the House and Senate. And CFPB executives have been summoned to Capitol Hill more than 60 times since the agency was created.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Senate Republicans, still a minority in the first few years after the bureau opened, deployed the most powerful leverage they had: the power to block confirmations. In May 2011, two months before the CFPB launched, McConnell, then-minority leader, sent Obama \u003ca href=\"https://www.shelby.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2011/5/44-u-s-sens-to-obama-no-accountability-no-confirmation\">a letter\u003c/a> signed by 43 fellow Republicans.Make structural changes to the CFPB, the letter demanded, or we won’t even consider your nominee to head the agency — even if that nominee isn’t Warren. With confirmation requiring 60 votes, McConnell was in position to follow through on his threat.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Obama publicly acknowledged that he didn’t choose Warren, widely seen as the logical choice for permanent director, in part because she faced “very tough opposition.” He spoke of an “army of lobbyists right now working to water down the protections and reforms that we’ve passed.” Obama’s compromise was Cordray, the former Ohio attorney general whom Warren had chosen as her enforcement chief.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Cordray’s nomination precipitated a showdown over the use of a Senate filibuster to block presidential appointees. So Obama named him as acting chief through a January 2012 recess appointment, sparking more partisan rancor. A deal struck in July 2013 left the existing filibuster rules in place if Republicans would confirm Cordray, among other nominees. The CFPB finally had a permanent director — whose five-year term would already have been complete if not for the GOP’s political game-playing — and Warren a seat on the Senate Banking Committee, where she reigns as the CFPB’s fiercest defender. “The Republicans were too clever by half,” said Barney Frank, the former representative behind Dodd-Frank.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>By that point, the campaign to obstruct and undermine the CFPB had taken shape. Its early members included the payday lenders, whose trade group, the Community Financial Services Association of America, spent $478,000 lobbying last year. They were joined by the Consumer Bankers Association, Hunt’s organization, which spent $3.2 million on lobbying in 2016; the American Bankers Association, which spent $9.8 million on the services of 58 lobbyists that same year; and the other influential trade associations representing big financial players. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the powerhouse industry group that last year had 158 lobbyists on its payroll, joined the fight as well.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Law firms were enlisted in the fight. They’ve filed at least 21 suits challenging everything from specific enforcement actions to CFPB-issued rules to the bureau’s very legitimacy, tying up CFPB’s team of lawyers in court. So were think tanks and public relations specialists, including industry front groups that back anti-CFPB advertisements or organize anti-CFPB “astroturf” campaigns, which seek to create the appearance of grassroots opposition. Together, they’ve found a receptive audience in such conservative outlets as the Washington Times, the Daily Caller, and Breitbart, where Cordray has been called a “czar.” The usual suspects on the right also regularly publish critiques of the bureau from the likes of the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, and the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, the latter of which is funded by the Koch Family Foundations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Opposing the CFPB has become profitable enough to attract star players like Newt Gingrich. Gingrich was a paid senior adviser to an astroturf group called the U.S. Consumer Coalition when he penned a \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10907564710791284872504581070502004499610\">Wall Street Journal op-ed\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://archive.org/stream/gov.gpo.fdsys.CHRG-114hhrg99797/CHRG-114hhrg99797_djvu.txt\">testified\u003c/a> before a House panel laying out the many reasons he thinks the CFPB ought to be abolished. (The Journal felt compelled to print an “amplification” when his affiliation as was revealed.)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The payday lenders, one agency staffer said, are “probably our most vociferous foes.” There have been times, this staffer said, when several people inside the bureau have been devoted entirely to one of their trade association’s “mega-document requests.” Paul Bland, executive director of Public Justice, a Washington, D.C.-based corporate accountability group, said, “It’s like something from ‘Game of Thrones.’”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That was never clearer than in June 2016, when the bureau unveiled its draft on payday loans. The rules required a lender to either verify a borrower’s ability to repay or cap each borrower at six loans per year. The payday lenders chose none of the above. Instead, lenders engaged online software firms to generate automated messages from their customers and set out paper and pens in storefronts to generate boxes full of letters to the CFPB. In just four months, the industry submitted over 1 million comment letters, each of which, under federal law, the CFPB needed to log, catalogue, and address.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The clash has grown only more intense since Trump’s election. Now most regulatory agencies are in the hands of Trump loyalists or former players in the financial industry. For the past five months, only the CFPB, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Fed were still run by Obama appointees. “It’s the nail that sticks up that gets pounded,” said Jeff Sovern, a consumer law professor at St. John&#8217;s University in New York.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Cordray, for his part, has generally played the technocrat and leaves the political fighting to others. Just three days after Trump was sworn in as president, the CFPB fined Citibank $28.8 million for giving the run-around to thousands of borrowers trying to avoid a home foreclosure. One week later, it sued a small ring of lawyers, accusing them of levying high fees on clients seeking to lessen their debt loads. In an “all-hands call” the agency set up three weeks after the election, Cordray had advised his staff: “Keep calm and carry on.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Banks are thriving after five years of record profits. But they have continued to attack the bureau, Bland said, as if it’s “the demon that’s gonna swallow capitalism.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'>\u003cbr />\n\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/11/Barney-Frank-Nancy-Pelosi-toned-1510857314.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-158393\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/11/Barney-Frank-Nancy-Pelosi-toned-1510857314-1024x718.jpg\" alt=\"WASHINGTON - DECEMBER 09:  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) (R) and Rep.

Pugnacious and wiry, with a shaved head and intense eyes, Hunt leaned in and, in a swampy Louisiana accent, said, “Now you’re just flattering me.” In a conference room in the nondescript Washington headquarters of the Consumer Bankers Association, Hunt launched into a well-rehearsed diatribe about an agency that has cost his member banks billions of dollars in fines. The CFPB is autocratic, Hunt said. Its people are clueless. (“I would say 90 to 95 percent of the people have no idea how a bank operates,” he said.) And don’t get him started about the CFPB’s “one-sided” crackdown on student loan abuse or the “idiocy” of its failed arbitration rule.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But Hunt reserved his strongest attacks for what he saw as Cordray’s unchecked power. “Keep in mind that Elizabeth Warren modeled the CFPB on the consumer safety product — wait for it — commission,” Hunt said. The version of Dodd-Frank first passed by the House in 2009 put a five-person commission in charge of the agency. The Senate, however, recognized the advantage of a single director who would not need to corral three votes to make a decision. For Hunt, this was the original sin.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“At 2 o’clock in the morning on the day the bill was passed, they went from a commission, as introduced by Barney Frank and passed in the House of Representatives under Nancy Pelosi, to a director setup that puts way too much power in the hands of one individual,” Hunt said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The grievances of the major banks that pay Hunt’s salary grew over time. Many had expected CFPB enforcement to focus on subprime lenders operating on the economic fringes, not the country’s largest banks. Yet in 2014, the CFPB ordered Bank of America to pay $727 million to 1.9 million customers the bureau said were “illegally charged” for credit monitoring services they were not receiving. The next year, the bureau hit Citibank with a $700 million penalty for similar violations. Banks issuing private student loans were also in the bureau’s sights, along with the servicing firms that collect payments on their behalf. Even a trade association representing credit unions joined the fight against the CFPB after the bureau implemented new mortgage rules that some members complained increased their paperwork and legal costs. One, the Credit Union National Association, in 2014 hired a former congressperson and Gingrich acolyte named Jim Nussle as its CEO at a salary of $1 million a year. Five of Nussle’s colleagues make more than $300,000 a year.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The CFPB has jurisdiction over nearly every financial player that interacts with the public; Hunt’s group counted and found that the CFPB oversees 15,000 to 16,000 businesses and other entities. (The CFPB could not confirm that estimate.) And as the CFPB has spread its wings, taking on credit card companies, debt remediation operations, and lenders in the $1.1 trillion auto loan market, the bureau’s list of enemies has grown.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“In all, it’s worked out very well for consumers,” said Ed Mierzwinski, a lobbyist for the left-leaning U.S.-Public Interest Research Group. “But it’s caused a lot more guns to be aimed at the agency.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When talking with Hunt, CFPB’s consumer complaint database was another point of contention. Anyone facing a problem with a financial institution — a policy they see as unfair, a lender not taking a complaint seriously — can phone, write, or log in online to register their displeasure. “They’re supposed to be an entity of the federal government,” Hunt said. “But I think in this case, Yelp has a better reputation for verification than the CFPB.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In June, the Treasury Department recommended that the bureau restrict access to state and federal regulators. That same month, House Republicans obliged the banks by passing a bill that would bar the CFPB from maintaining the database at all.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'>\u003cbr />\n\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/11/Richard-Cordray-CFPB2-1510939537.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-158523\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/11/Richard-Cordray-CFPB2-1510939537-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 06:  Richard Cordray is sworn in at the beginning of his confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee on Capitol Hill September 6, 2011 in Washington, DC.

He got his start in politics as a county treasurer in suburban Columbus, Ohio, and is an “aw-shucks” moderate with a centrist resume. He clerked for Judge Robert Bork, a conservative, and Supreme Court justices Anthony Kennedy, who was appointed by Ronald Reagan, and Byron White, who was appointed by John F. Kennedy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The challenge for members of Hensarling’s House Financial Services Committee, where Cordray has been seen a “dictator” occupying a “czar’s throne,” is to find proxy issues that let them attack the bureau without directly attacking its popular enforcement actions or consumer-friendly rules. The committee’s first impulse was to demonize Cordray himself. Rep. Ann Wagner, a Missouri Republican who now  chairs the House Financial Services’ Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations and flanked Trump for a photo op as he signed one of his deregulatory decrees, has called Cordray an “imperial director” overseeing an “unconstitutional behemoth.” Not to be outdone, Hensarling has publicly wondered which best fits Cordray: “credit czar, national nanny, or benevolent financial product dictator.” Just this year, Hensarling declared that he may pursue contempt-of-Congress proceedings against Cordray and called for an investigation into Cordray for alleged violations of a federal ban on political activities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Another early proxy fight began with the decision to house the CFPB in a structure near the White House once used by the now-defunct Office of Thrift Supervision. It was a “run-down concrete building,” according to a Bloomberg article, in need of a gut renovation. That renovation provided committee members several years of opportunity to vilify Cordray and his team. Hensarling accused Cordray of building a “Taj Mahal” and Wagner, at a 2015 hearing, interrupted Cordray seven times while asking him to explain the “wasteful renovations.” Before he could offer a coherent response, she moved on to a diatribe about the agency’s “power grab” over mortgages and other financial products. Several months later, a report from the Federal Reserve’s Inspector General, produced at the request of the committee, concluded that the costs “appear reasonable.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Much would be made, too, about the CFPB’s salaries. Bureau employees are paid, on average, significantly more than other government employees but so are employees of the Fed and FDIC. “The idea is to help the bank regulators compete somewhat better with the private sector,” said Mike Calhoun of the Center for Responsible Lending, who noted that bureau employees still earn far less than their private sector counterparts.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The agency’s opponents hit pay dirt in 2014 when the \u003ca href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/news/cfpb-staff-evaluations-show-sharp-racial-disparities\">American Banker\u003c/a>  obtained confidential data revealing a pattern at the CFPB of ranking white employees higher than minorities in performance reviews. Within weeks, the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee held its first of five hearings on the matter. A senior enforcement attorney described her “long and trying ordeal” enduring gender discrimination and retaliation, and suggested that the agency “establish its own Wounded Warrior program” to assist victims of discrimination. One investigator hired by the bureau to look into the attorney’s case testified that the CFPB was a “toxic workplace.” At one of the later hearings, in June 2015, the agency’s senior equal employment specialist testified that nothing had improved at the agency since the hearings began, that she was “frequently approached” by CFPB employees with grievances about maltreatment and discrimination.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That same year, Democratic staffers working for the House Financial Services Committee put out a report examining racial patterns at all seven federal financial regulators, which showed that the CFPB was hardly an outlier. Investigators found the pattern of ranking white employees higher than black employees at all seven — yet Hensarling’s committee didn’t call a single hearing on any of the others. Nearly one in five CFPB employees were black\u003ca href=\"https://democrats-financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/fsc_dems_-_staff_report_-_dodd-frank_five_years_later_-_diversity_in_the_financial_services_agencies_-_final.pdf\">, tying it for third in diversity among the seven\u003c/a>, the report said, and the CFPB had at least begun to make needed changes, including a redesigned employee ranking system. A \u003ca href=\"http://bestplacestowork.org/BPTW/rankings/categories/mid/diversity\">2016 “best places to work” survey\u003c/a> of employees found that the CFPB ranked fourth out of 26 mid-sized federal agencies in its “support for diversity.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>None of that affected Hensarling’s rhetoric. “In all the time I&#8217;ve been in government, I&#8217;ve never seen an agency that&#8217;s had more accusations of racial discrimination,” he told \u003ca href=\"http://www.npr.org/2017/02/24/516983751/rep-jeb-hensarling-calls-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-a-rogue-agency\">NPR\u003c/a> earlier this year.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Another big dressing-down of the CFPB followed news in 2016 of Wells Fargo opening fraudulent accounts in the names of more than 1 million customers. (That number has since ballooned to 3.5 million.) In April, Wagner chastised Corday for being “asleep at the wheel,” charging that the Los Angeles Times, which broke the story, the Los Angeles City Attorney, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency had “all got there before you did.” Yet it was another Wells Fargo regulator, the OCC that, two weeks later, was slammed in an \u003ca href=\"https://www.occ.gov/publications/publications-by-type/other-publications-reports/pub-wells-fargo-supervision-lessons-learned-41917.pdf\">internal report\u003c/a> for its “untimely and ineffective” response. By 2010 — before the CFPB even existed — the OCC was already aware that Wells had received 700 whistleblower complaints related to the gaming of incentive plans but failed to properly follow up. Yet House Financial Services never initiated a hearing to grill the OCC, now in the hands of Keith Noreika, a Trump-appointed lawyer who had spent his career protecting banks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Then again, attacking the OCC wouldn’t pay like criticizing the CFPB. One former chair of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, Patrick McHenry, took $2 million in campaign contributions from the financial sector during the 2015-16 election cycle, according to \u003ca href=\"http://ourfinancialsecurity.org/2017/03/afr-report-wall-street-lobby-campaign-cash-tops-2-billion-2016-elections/\">a study by Americans for Financial Reform\u003c/a>, and another, Duffy, the former reality star, took in more than $1 million during the same period. That same study found that Hensarling received $1.9 million in contributions and that House Speaker Paul Ryan, who tweeted last year that the CFPB “tries to micromanage your everyday life,” received $5.7 million from the financial sector in 2015 and 2016. MapLight, a nonprofit that tracks the influence of money in politics, \u003ca href=\"https://maplight.org/story/banking-industry-gave-four-times-more-to-gop-sponsors-of-bill-to-curb-consumer-lawsuits/\">reported\u003c/a> in August that the 35 Republican House members who sponsored legislation to repeal the CFPB’s arbitration rule received more than four times the contributions from the commercial banking industry than lawmakers who opposed the bill.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'>\u003cbr />\n\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/11/Trump-Gingrich-1510939781.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-158524\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/11/Trump-Gingrich-1510939781-1024x728.jpg\" alt=\"CINCINNATI, OH- JULY 6: Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (R) shakes hands with Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump during a rally at the Sharonville Convention Center July 6, 2016, in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Over lunch at an upscale D.C. eatery, Brian Wise, director of the U.S. Consumers Coalition, vented about the frustrations of running an honest astroturf campaign in today’s political scrum. A year or two earlier, a rival dark money group called Protect America’s Consumers tried to encroach on his turf. While his organization’s Twitter handle is @USConsumers, the other group chose @USAConsumers, he said, “to try and confuse people.” He knows who is funding this rival effort, he claimed, but wouldn’t say more than “it’s an industry I don’t accept money from.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Yet Wise is equally secretive about who is funding his coalition’s efforts to thwart the CFPB, and who his coalition represents. (When asked to name his coalition’s members, he said only, “We’re a different kind of organization.”) He created his group in 2013, the same year the CFPB released a report concluding that, for many customers, a payday loan becomes an inescapable debt trap. For him, that conclusion put at risk the inalienable right of a consumer to take out a loan, even if it means paying a 400 percent interest rate. “Our mission,” he said, “is to advocate for greater choice and freedom.” He denied that he has taken money from payday lenders but otherwise declined to discuss his funding. Whatever the source, there was enough money to pay for a lobbyist between 2014 and 2016 and “for us to hire outside consultants and advisers, including Speaker Gingrich.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Wise is a stocky man with a goatee and a dusting of gray in his neatly clipped black hair. In conversation, he was also unfailingly polite in that Washington way, respectfully referring to “Chairman Cordray” and “Speaker Pelosi,” even as he dismissed them as fools, dupes, or something far less flattering. For much of the meal, Wise focused on the proxy battles, speaking of the racial charges against the CFPB and also of another hobby horse: the CFPB’s data collection practices.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Wise acknowledged that the bureau has only acted as scholars do, using data mining to grow smarter about consumer behavior. He was not nearly so reassuring in the 2015 article he wrote for the Daily Caller, the conservative website co-founded by Tucker Carlson, which ran under the headline, “Move Over NSA – CFPB Spying Is Even More Invasive.” Gingrich, on Wise’s dime, was equally alarmist in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10907564710791284872504581070502004499610\">Wall Street Journal op-ed\u003c/a> he wrote that same year (“A Government Snoop That Puts the NSA To Shame”), which called on privacy advocates to make the bureau “your next target.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Wise’s group also raised enough money to produce an ad dubbed the “\u003ca href=\"http://www.cfpbreform.org/thecfpbman/\">CFPB Man\u003c/a>,” featuring a large man in sunglasses and a fedora. As he looms over a couple, one explains to the other that the man is with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, “that secretive government agency that tracks all our credit card purchases.” The ad, which has appeared mainly online, asks people to visit a website that touts the idea of putting the CFPB under a bipartisan commission and giving Congress more control over CFPB operations. Other bank regulators — the Fed, the FDIC, and the OCC — are, like the CFPB, independently funded through fees paid by the financial institutions they monitor. But Wise, along with scholars at Heritage and Cato, wants Congress to contain the CFPB’s budget.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Another \u003ca href=\"http://www.autoremarketing.com/subprime/500k-ad-campaign-against-cfpb-launches\">anti-CFPB ad\u003c/a> was released in late 2015 by a group called the American Action Network. The ad, backed by a $500,000 ad campaign, depicts a CFPB ripped from an anti-Soviet propaganda film: In a huge, bland room, colorless except for red banners featuring images of Corday and Warren, rows of bureaucrats indiscriminately stamp “DENIED” on loan applications. The agency, a narrator intones, was “designed to interfere with your personal financial decisions.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The ad never mentions Navient, a giant in the student loan world, nor did a companion website, StopCFPB.com. But the \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/11/10/navient-fox-debate/\">company’s fingerprints\u003c/a> were all over the effort. The American Action Network board was stacked with lobbyists for the student loan industry: Vin Weber, a former Republican congressperson-turned-lobbyist who represents Navient as a client; Tom Reynolds, a lawyer registered as a Navient lobbyist in 2015; and Barry Jackson, who worked for a lobbying firm that represented a Navient rival. Most tellingly, the ad campaign launched just three months after \u003ca href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1593538/000119312515300307/d77848d8k.htm\">Navient revealed\u003c/a> that a subsidiary was being investigated by the CFPB on charges that it had cheated student borrowers. The CFPB formally \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/business/dealbook/student-loans-navient-lawsuit.html?_r=0\">sued Navient\u003c/a> this past January.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Yet \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJB2vPSVklY\">another attack ad\u003c/a>, produced by Wise’s imitator, Protect America’s Consumers, appeared in 2016 on Fox News and other cable channels, warning that “the CFPB is plagued with scandal and corruption.” This time, Politico raised the question of “\u003ca href=\"http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/politico-influence/2016/01/new-koch-linked-group-attacks-cfpb-211982\">Koch fingerprints\u003c/a>.” Protect America’s Consumers had the same Virginia address as a law firm that had registered several Koch-linked groups, a firm, Politico reported, that “specializes in untraceable pressure groups for conservative causes.” A spokesperson for the group denied any Koch connection but also declined to answer questions about its backers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'>\u003cbr />\n\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/11/Richard-Smith-Equifax-1510940022.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-158525\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/11/Richard-Smith-Equifax-1510940022-1024x736.jpg\" alt=\"WASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 04:  Former Equifax CEO Richard Smith prepares to testify before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in the Hart Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill October 4, 2017 in Washington, DC.

By 2 p.m., Hunt’s Consumer Bankers Association had issued statements and one-pagers stressing that arbitration was “faster, better, and more cost-effective” than litigation, ignoring that, under the rule, arbitration would remain an option. Hunt demanded that Congress “move swiftly and overturn this anti-consumer rule.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Other trade associations quickly mobilized: the American Bankers Association, the Financial Services Roundtable, Nussle’s credit union group. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce released a 30-second ad decrying the latest abomination from this “rogue government agency and their trial lawyer pals.” Conservative think tanks ranging from the Mercatus Center at George Mason to Americans for Tax Reform released similarly overheated statements.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Two federal agencies, now run by Trump appointees, have now also joined in the fight. In October, the Treasury put out a report opposing the arbitration rule. So, too, did Noreika, Trump’s acting head of the Office of the Comptroller, who had spent the summer publicly sniping at Cordray over the arbitration rule. After six years of study, Noreika argued for more study.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>By late July, the House had already passed a resolution to kill the rule. The Senate had yet to act when the Equifax breach exposed information on 143 million consumers, sparking widespread criticism of the company for locking its customers into mandatory arbitration. Equifax, under pressure, withdrew the arbitration provision, but American Banker speculated that the episode “may ultimately doom” efforts to overturn the rule.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Taking no chances, in late September, the Consumer Bankers Association, along with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Bankers Association, \u003ca href=\"https://consumerist.com/2017/09/29/chamber-of-commerce-files-lawsuit-to-stop-american-consumers-from-being-able-to-file-lawsuits/\">sued the CFPB\u003c/a>, challenging the rule’s “constitutionality and legality.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The lawsuit wasn’t necessary. GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy joined with the Democrats in voting to leave the arbitration rule in place. But with Pence’s tie-breaking vote, that wasn’t enough. Cordray, the punching bag, will soon be gone, and Trump will get to appoint his replacement. Reportedly, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney will serve as the agency’s acting director. Mulvaney, a \u003ca href=\"http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2017/09/01/Mick-Mulvaney-Self-Proclaimed-Right-Wing-Nutjob-Behind-Trump-s-Budget\">self-described “right-wing nut job\u003c/a>,” said while still in Congress, “I don&#8217;t like the fact that the CFPB exists.” A new director could quickly halt any draft rules still in formation and begin the arduous process of reversing rules that have incurred the wrath of Wall Street or other financial interests. Enforcement could grind to a halt; the complaint database could be mothballed. And Cordray’s departure could be followed by others, said Nick Rathod, the bureau’s former assistant director: “I imagine a number of the staff following him out.” Donner, of Americans for Financial Reform, said, “It will be a big change. But they can’t make it all go away with the stroke of a pen. Rules can’t be unwritten without rulemaking, and we and others will be fierce to be sure they consult with the public and consider the facts.” Trump’s team signaled its intentions shortly after the election with its selection of the four-person landing team assigned to evaluate the CFPB. One was Julie Bell Lindsay, who had been a top lawyer for Citigroup. Another was Kyle Hauptman, former executive director of the Main Street Growth Project, an organization “focused on protecting everyday Americans and small businesses from becoming caught in the crossfire in the effort to ‘reform Wall Street.’&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Structural reforms to the CFPB will have to make their way through the conflicted GOP leadership in Congress. The party’s pro-business faction backs the idea of neutralizing the bureau by imposing a five-person governing commission. But, said one GOP congressional staffer, “you’ve got a lot of Republicans saying that a single director is not such a bad idea now that Donald Trump is in the White House.” In June, the House passed Hensarling’s Financial CHOICE Act, which Ryan dubbed “\u003ca href=\"http://thehill.com/regulation/overnights/358114-trump-to-sign-repeal-of-consumer-arbitration-rule-epa-kicks-grant-scientists-off-advisory-boards-exxon-settles-air-case-hensarling-to-retire\">the crown jewel\u003c/a>” of the GOP agenda. The CHOICE Act keeps the CFPB in the hands of a single director while stripping the bureau of many of its regulatory powers. Yet there is no companion bill in the Senate, where 60 votes are required to make any structural changes to the CFPB. Congressional Republicans can continue to deploy the Congressional Review Act, which they used to reverse the arbitration rule, though at this point, only the fate of the bureau’s payday rule, issued in October, is up in the air. No other major new rules are far along in the pipeline.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Looming as an existential threat to the bureau is a lawsuit that’s been working its way through federal courts since 2015. That was the year the \u003ca href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2015/10/16/phh-cfpb-sanction-kickback-mortgage-lender.html\">CFPB slapped a $109 million fine\u003c/a> on a New Jersey-based mortgage company called PHH that the bureau found had taken illegal kickbacks for referring customers to mortgage insurers. PHH responded by filing a lawsuit that challenged the constitutionality of the agency. In October 2016, just a month before Election Day, a three-judge panel issued a surprise ruling declaring that an agency whose director could only be removed for cause was unconstitutional. Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote the decision, called Cordray the “single most powerful official in the entire U.S. Government, other than the President.” Hensarling declared it “a good day for democracy.” Now he’s called Cordray’s resignation “an excellent opportunity to enact desperately needed reforms.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The CFPB appealed, and the full court, which heard oral arguments in May, is still considering the case. The Center for Responsible Lending, PIRG, Americans for Financial Reform, Rep. Maxine Waters, Sen. Sherrod Brown, and other Democrats are among those who filed amicus briefs supporting the bureau. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the debt collectors, and the Cato Institute filed on behalf of PHH. Most interesting perhaps is the Justice Department, which switched sides in the case in March by filing a brief siding with PHH. The president’s right to fire the sitting director of the CFPB seemed like a splendid idea now that a Republican was occupying the White House.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>This article was reported in partnership with The Investigative Fund at The Nation Institute.\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Correction: Nov. 18, 2017\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>An earlier version of this article stated that GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski and John Kennedy voted with Democrats to leave the arbitration rule in place.

Abaixo da superfície, depois que o magma esfriou, formaram-se enormes camadas de granito, estendendo-se por até 15km em todas as direções. Em um certo lugar, contudo, a lava irrompeu pela superfície e formou uma montanha peculiar no meio de uma planície monótona.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Essa estrutura hoje é conhecida como Stone Mountain (“Montanha de Pedra”, em português).\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Só para se ter uma ideia, Stone Mountain já tinha 343 milhões de anos de idade antes de  qualquer coisa minimamente parecida com um ser humano aparecer na superfície do planeta. Depois disso, durante os cerca de 6.999.900 anos de existência do homem na Terra, a Stone Mountain permaneceu intocada, na área atualmente conhecida como Região Metropolitana de Atlanta, nos Estados Unidos.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Então, em 1915, aquela velha montanha de 349 milhões de anos se tornou o berço da Ku Klux Klan (KKK). As montanhas, é claro, não podem ser racistas. Elas são apartidárias, não enxergam raça ou religião, não são xenófobas ou homofóbicas. Depois de um longo período de existência – cinquenta vezes mais longo do que a presença do ser humano no mundo –, alguns homens brancos inseguros, no sul dos EUA, transformaram o que era uma maravilha da natureza em uma aberração.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>O grande responsável por isso foi Sam Venable. Esse racista de longa data comprou Stone Mountain – o que por si só já é absurdo – em 1887. Venable e sua família já haviam adquirido pedreiras em todo o estado da Geórgia, e agora pretendiam explorar Stone Mountain. Mas os irmãos Venable não atuavam apenas no negócio de pedras, mas também no da intolerância. Os dois tiveram um papel central na expansão inicial da KKK, e chegaram a conceder a essa violenta organização supremacista branca \u003ca href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2015/7/14/1402185/-When-the-world-s-largest-monument-to-the-Confederacy-is-now-in-a-town-with-75-African-Americans\">o direito de usar suas terras\u003c/a> para sediar encontros locais, regionais e nacionais.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Idolatria\u003c/em> (tradução livre de \u003cem>Graven Image\u003c/em>, título original do filme), um brilhante curta-metragem de Sierra Pettengill – produzido pela Fields of Vision –, conta a história da profanação de Stone Mountain. Com impactantes imagens de arquivo, o filme narra as origens de um monumento confederado esculpido na face da montanha. Trata-se de um relato moderno: embora algumas passagens não tenham som, o monumento de Stone Mountain é uma ideia recente o suficiente para que sua história fosse toda registrada em película. A inauguração da escultura foi transmitida ao vivo e a cores, como mostra o filme de Pettengill.\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-right' data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='right'>Com impactantes imagens de arquivo, &#8220;Idolatria&#8221; narra as origens de um monumento confederado esculpido na face da montanha.\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>Em 1916, um ano após a KKK realizar o ritual da queima da cruz em Stone Mountain e  anunciar seu renascimento, a ideia de desfigurar a montanha com uma escultura  gigantesca dos heróis da Confederação começou a ganhar força. É de conhecimento geral o papel de tantos homens terríveis na criação e na manutenção do racismo sistêmico nos EUA; mas a atuação vergonhosa de muitas mulheres brancas permanece relativamente desconhecida. Em \u003cem>Idolatria\u003c/em>, porém, o protagonismo das mulheres no esforço para transformar a montanha em um monumento ao racismo não é ignorado. Pettengill mostra imagens de arquivo de mulheres brancas, em seus vestidos rendados, bordando uma bandeira confederada.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Foi Caroline Helen Jemison Plane, presidente da sucursal de Atlanta da United Daughters of the Confederacy (“Filhas Unidas da Confederação”, UDC), que convenceu os donos da propriedade a conceder à organização acesso à montanha. Ao criar a Stone Mountain Confederate Monumental Association, a ideia original de Plane era que os líderes da KKK fossem imortalizados ao lado dos generais confederados.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>De 1916 até o auge dos movimentos pelos direitos civis, nos anos 1960, os trabalhos prosseguiram de maneira intermitente, sempre com o apoio da UDC. Mas uma coisa permaneceu constante: a montanha nunca deixou de ser usada como ponto de encontro de racistas.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cu>Antigamente,\u003c/u> todo negro da Geórgia sabia que não devia entrar naquele lugar. Foi o que descobri em primeira mão em 1998, quando ainda estudava no Morehouse College – uma universidade para jovens negros fundada em outra colina georgiana em 1867. Em uma aula de História Afro-Americana com o lendário Dr. Marcellus Barksdale, ele nos aconselhou a nunca ir a Stone Mountain. Com uma seriedade que surpreendeu a todos, ele nos contou como tudo naquele lugar era não só odioso como também destinado a nos ofender e intimidar.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Enquanto o Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. e o movimento pelos direitos civis conquistavam respeito e influência no país, os políticos brancos da Geórgia, cem anos depois da Guerra Civil Americana, decidiram que havia chegado novamente a hora de dedicar todos os seus esforços – e recursos públicos – para finalmente completar aquele monumento confederado. Nada mais natural. Afinal, um monumento aos líderes do exército confederado era tudo de que o sul dos EUA mais precisava nos anos 1960, certo?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Contrariando o conselho do meu professor, visitei Stone Mountain várias vezes. A escultura e o parque de diversões construído ao redor dela eram tão ruins quanto ele descrevera. Além do mais, aquele pedaço de terra não tinha nada a ver com a Guerra Civil. Ao que tudo indica, os três homens cujas imagens foram gravadas no granito – Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee e Stonewall Jackson – nunca estiveram naquele lugar.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Stone Mountain não virou o maior monumento à Confederação por ter uma conexão com a história confederada, e sim porque os racistas que a compraram – e adoravam que ela fosse ponto de encontro da KKK – sabiam que nada daria tanta visibilidade à sua visão de mundo quanto aquela escultura.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Em \u003cem>Idolatria\u003c/em>, vemos o então governador racista e segregacionista da Geórgia, Marvin Griffin, anunciando, em 1958, o uso de recursos públicos para comprar a montanha e incentivar a continuação da obra. Ele sabia muito bem o que significava construir aquele monumento naquele momento histórico, mas isso não o impediu de prosseguir.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Atualmente, a cidade de Stone Mountain é tão negra quanto a NBA, a liga de basquete dos Estados Unidos. A Região Metropolitana de Atlanta, o lar de algumas das melhores “universidades historicamente negras” do mundo, é vista por muitos como a Meca dos negros americanos. Apesar disso, lá está aquela escultura, homenageando homens que lutaram com unhas e dentes para preservar a escravidão nos EUA.\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-left' data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='left'>Stone Mountain é um monumento que não tem vergonha, mas sim orgulho de sua história.\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>Hoje em dia, Stone Mountain é um monumento que não tem vergonha, mas sim orgulho de sua história. Todas as noites, um estranho show de luzes projetadas na face da montanha celebra a Confederação – cena mostrada logo na abertura de \u003cem>Idolatria\u003c/em>. O parque temático associado ao monumento promete levar o visitante a uma versão nostálgica do início do século 19, embora todos saibam que aqueles tempos não foram nada agradáveis para os negros das redondezas.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A KKK continua sediando encontros em Stone Mountain até hoje, o que não é nenhuma surpresa, pois poucos lugares no país se esforçaram tanto para que eles se sentissem em casa.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Stone Mountain foi uma Charlottesville antes de Charlottesville. Há muitas gerações, homens brancos inseguros vestem fantasias e andam a esmo por lá carregando tochas, tentando intimidar os outros com seus rituais ridículos.

Indeed, that Russia&#8217;s alleged &#8220;meddling&#8221; is comparable to the two most devastating attacks in U.S. history has, overnight, become a virtual cliché.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The claim that Russian meddling in the election is &#8220;an act of war&#8221; comparable to these events isn&#8217;t brand new. Senators from both parties, such as \u003ca href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/john-mccain-russian-cyberattacks-an-act-of-war/article/2610654\">Republican John McCain\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/322002-dem-senator-we-should-determine-if-russian-election-hacking-was-act-of\">Democrat Jeanne Shaheen\u003c/a>, have long described Russian meddling in 2016 as an &#8220;act of war.&#8221; Hillary Clinton, while promoting her book last October, \u003ca href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimwaterson/hillary-clinton-suggests-russian-interference-in-us?utm_term=.cwmOyqNA3#.iedqOp703\">described\u003c/a> Russia&#8217;s alleged hacking of the DNC and John Podesta&#8217;s email inbox as a &#8220;cyber 9/11.&#8221; And last February, the always war-hungry Tom Friedman of the New York Times \u003ca href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/02/14/friedman_flynn_resignation_shows_russia_hacking_was_on_scale_with_911_pearl_harbor.html\">said on\u003c/a> &#8220;Morning Joe&#8221; that Russian hacking &#8220;was a 9/11-scale event. They attacked the core of our democracy. That was a Pearl Harbor-scale event.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But the last few days have ushered in an explosion of this rhetoric from politicians and journalists alike. On Friday night&#8217;s Chris Hayes show on MSNBC, two separate guests &#8212; Democratic Rep.

Roosevelt in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor, if he had taken to the radio airwaves to declare that Tokyo was &#8216;laughing their asses off.&#8217; Or if George W. Bush had stood in the rubble of the World Trade Center with a bullhorn and launched a name-calling tirade against the Democrats.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>David &#8220;Axis of Evil&#8221; Frum went back a century earlier to \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/02/america-is-under-attack-and-the-president-doesnt-care/553667/\">write that\u003c/a> Trump&#8217;s inaction amounts to &#8220;a dereliction of duty as grave as any since President Buchanan looked the other way as Southern state governments pillaged federal arsenals on the eve of the Civil War.&#8221; Podesta &#8212; who served as Bill Clinton&#8217;s chief of staff, as well as Hillary Clinton&#8217;s 2016 campaign chair &#8212; \u003ca href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/374472-podesta-trump-first-draft-dodger-in-war-to-protect-democracy\">called Trump a &#8220;draft dodger&#8221;\u003c/a> for failing to engage what he called this &#8220;war&#8221; with Russia.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Let&#8217;s leave aside what a stinging indictment this claim is of the Obama presidency. It not only means that Barack Obama allowed an attack of the magnitude of Pearl Harbor and 9/11 to happen on his watch, but worse, did very little &#8212; basically nothing &#8212; in response, allegedly due to fears that any retaliation would be criticized by Republicans as partisan. But for those who really believe this rhetoric, can fears of political attacks really justify inaction by the commander-in-chief &#8212; whose primary duty, we&#8217;re so often told, is to protect the nation &#8212; in the face of a Pearl Harbor or a 9/11? To posit this equivalence is to condemn Obama in the harshest possible terms, to accuse him of utter malfeasance in protecting the nation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But the more important question is the one these chest-beating politicians and pundits notably refrain from addressing. If Russian election meddling is on par with the Pearl Harbor and 9/11 attacks, then should the U.S. response be on par with its response to those attacks? Japan&#8217;s attack on Pearl Harbor prompted U.S. involvement in a world war and, ultimately, dropping two nuclear bombs on Japan; 9/11 initiated wars in multiple countries that still, 17 years later, have no end in sight, along with a systematic and still-worsening erosion of basic civil liberties.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This has been a long-standing tactic during the war on terror of neoconservatives: They love to accuse everyone of being insufficiently &#8220;tough&#8221; or &#8220;aggressive&#8221; with whatever country they crave heightened tensions, but they never specify what greater &#8220;toughness&#8221; is needed, because to do so would expose their extremism. Indeed, for years, GOP hawks such as John McCain, Marco Rubio, and Jeb Bush \u003ca href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/21/politics/mccain-obama-wrong-about-north-korea/index.html\">often\u003c/a> \u003ca href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/obama-putin-meeting-criticism-377689\">accused\u003c/a> Obama &#8212; who repeatedly \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/09/09/whats-behind-obamas-ongoing-accommodation-of-vladimir-putin/\">tried to accommodate and even partner\u003c/a> with Russian President Vladimir Putin &#8212; of being insufficiently &#8220;tough&#8221; on the Russians, of being too &#8220;weak&#8221; to &#8220;stand up&#8221; to the Russian leader, without specifying what they wanted him to do beyond arming Ukrainians. Regarding Obama&#8217;s alleged weakness toward Putin, \u003ca href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/19/politics/us-russia-putin-obama/index.html\">McCain said\u003c/a> in 2014 that &#8220;history will judge this administration incredibly harshly.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The only specific proposal one hears now when it comes to responding to Russian meddling is a call for &#8220;sanctions.&#8221; But if one really believes that Russia&#8217;s actions amount to Pearl Harbor or 9/11, then sanctions seem like a very lame &#8212; indeed, a woefully inadequate &#8212; response. To borrow their rhetoric, imagine if Roosevelt had confined his response to Pearl Harbor to sanctions on Japanese leaders, or if Bush had announced sanctions on Al Qaeda as his sole response to 9/11. If you really believe this rhetoric, then you must support retaliation beyond mere sanctions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Indeed, Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for years, but critics like McCain insisted that it had no hope of changing Putin&#8217;s behavior, let alone imposing any real punishment. &#8220;The only thing that will dissuade Vladimir Putin from what he is doing is when coffins come back to the families in Russia,&#8221; \u003ca href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/19/politics/us-russia-putin-obama/index.html\">McCain said\u003c/a> of Russia&#8217;s annexation of Crimea.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At least McCain, for all his faults, is following his rhetoric through to its logical conclusions. If you really believe that Putin attacked the U.S. on a level even close to what was done at Pearl Harbor or on 9/11, then of course you&#8217;d be arguing for retaliation far greater than sanctions; you&#8217;d be arguing for military action such as arming Russia&#8217;s enemies if not beyond that, as McCain has done. You&#8217;d also be furious with Obama for allowing it to happen on his watch and then doing so little in response, \u003ca href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/mccain-rips-obamas-response-to-russian-hacking/article/2005934\">as McCain is\u003c/a>:\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 540px;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/02/wsmccain-1519052398.png\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-article-medium wp-image-171952\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/02/wsmccain-1519052398-540x490.png\" alt=\"\" />\u003c/a> \u003c/div>\n\u003cp>All of this underscores the serious dangers many have pointed to for more than a year about why all this unhinged rhetoric is so alarming. If you really believe that Russia &#8212; with some phishing links sent to Podesta and some fake Facebook ads and Twitter bots &#8212; committed an &#8220;act of war&#8221; of any kind, let alone one on par with \u003cem>Pearl Harbor and 9/11\u003c/em>, then it&#8217;s inevitable that extreme retaliatory measures will be considered and likely triggered. How does one justify a mere imposition of sanctions in the face of an attack similar to Pearl Harbor or 9/11? Doesn&#8217;t it stand to reason that something much more belligerent, enduring, and destructive would be necessary?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At the very least, no politician or pundit should be able to get away with issuing rhetoric of this type without being required to specify what they think ought to be done. Here, for instance, is &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221; host Chuck Todd, doing his best 2002 impression of Bill Kristol, decreeing \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/chucktodd/status/964619011005788160\">in a predictably viral tweet\u003c/a> that all patriotic Americans are duty-bound to focus on the question of what we should do to &#8220;punish Russia&#8221;:\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\">\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If you work in American politics or in the Gov’t on any level and your first reaction to today’s Mueller indictment is NOT ”how are we going to prevent this from happening again and how are we going to punish Russia,” then you need to rethink your priorities as a citizen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&mdash; Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/chucktodd/status/964619011005788160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 16, 2018\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>\u003cscript async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\">\u003c/script>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Note, though, that Todd himself neglects to specify what &#8220;punishment&#8221; he advocates. This is reckless rhetoric of the most irresponsible kind: demanding that everyone agree that &#8220;punishment&#8221; toward Russia is warranted (upon pain of being found guilty of bad citizenship), while failing to specify what punishment would be just, warranted, and rational. To do that is to deliberately beat the drums of war, cultivate an atmosphere of belligerence and aggression, without any limits or notions of proportionality.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That&#8217;s exactly what is being done by those who keep declaring the U.S. to be &#8220;at war&#8221; with Russia, and especially those who invoke the worst attacks in U.S. history when doing so, all while refusing to state what they think should be done in response.

These doubts have been strongly fortified by the new facts, previously under seal, that were revealed by today&#8217;s court filing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Beyond changing how the public understands the motives for this attack, this new perspective is likely to play a major role in the criminal trial of Mateen&#8217;s wife, Noor Salman, that is now underway in an Orlando federal courtroom, with jury selection expected to last another 10 days. Salman is accused of having aided her husband&#8217;s June 12, 2016, attack on the Orlando LGBT nightclub. She is also accused of obstructing justice by lying to the FBI.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-right  width-fixed' style='width: 225px;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/AP_293993734706-1520281675.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-174476\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/AP_293993734706-1520281675-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Undated photo or selfie of Omar Mateen, identified as the gunman in mass shooting at a gay club in Orlando, Florida on June 12, 2016.

With Mateen dead, the city — led by its LGBT community — is united in its eagerness that someone pay a price.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The prosecution of Mateen&#8217;s wife is highly unusual and troubling, riddled with evidentiary holes, and seemingly designed to feed, and exploit, community outrage that demands someone be punished for this massacre. The decision to prosecute Salman is particularly odd given the Department of Justice&#8217;s refusal to prosecute Marilou Danley, the girlfriend of Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock, despite \u003ca href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-vegas-shooting-warrants-20180112-story.html\">far greater evidence\u003c/a> suggesting her foreknowledge of his plans. Additionally, the DOJ refused to prosecute Katherine Russell, the white, ex-Christian wife of Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, also in the \u003ca href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/tamerlan-tsarnaevs-wife-sent-a-revealing-text-after-the-tragedy-2015-4\">face of evidence\u003c/a> of possible complicity that was far stronger than exists for Salman.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But independent of the problematic nature of Salman&#8217;s prosecution, numerous myths continue to persist about Mateen&#8217;s actions, particularly regarding his motives in why he attacked Pulse. As so often happens in the wake of mass shootings and terror attacks, media narratives emerge early on, when little is known, and never become dislodged from the public&#8217;s mind, even as the formal investigation reveals that there is little evidence to support those initial, still-common media claims — or, as is the case here, overwhelming evidence that strongly negates those beliefs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Perhaps most importantly, Mateen&#8217;s alleged motive in choosing Pulse — that he wanted to target and kill LGBTs due to some toxic mix of self-hatred over his own sexual orientation and his fealty to Islam — has been treated as unquestionably true in countless media accounts, statements from public officials, and ultimately in the public mind. But ample evidence now affirmatively casts serious doubt about whether there is any truth to this widely accepted belief about Mateen&#8217;s motives in attacking Pulse. While some of this conflicting evidence has been reported in the same media outlets that originally disseminated the narrative that Mateen sought to target the LGBT community, it has been downplayed to the point where few in the public are even aware that the original theories about Mateen&#8217;s motives have been undermined.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1024px;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/AP_17164048181389-1520280397.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-174466\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/AP_17164048181389-1520280397-1024x834.jpg\" alt=\"McKenna Post holds a rainbow flag as her mother, Randa Black, hugs her during a vigil at Lake Eola honoring the victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Fla., Monday, June 12, 2017.

But this afternoon, Salman&#8217;s lawyers \u003ca href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4402891-Doc-287-Defendant-s-Motion-to-Preclude-Improper.html\">filed a motion\u003c/a> to preclude the admissibility of certain evidence and, in doing so, provided a meaningful glimpse into many of the facts that are clearly at odds with the long-standing, prevailing view that Mateen&#8217;s motive, at least in part, was to attack a gay club and murder LGBT people. That includes searches on Mateen&#8217;s phones during the week of the attack, in which he was attempting to choose his target by searching generically for soft targets in the form of popular tourist locations or simply &#8220;nightclubs, Orlando&#8221; — not &#8220;gay nightclubs&#8221; or &#8220;LGBT clubs.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Back in June of last year, the Orlando Sentinel \u003ca href=\"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/pulse-orlando-nightclub-shooting/omar-mateen/os-pulse-omar-mateen-motive-20170512-story.html\">referenced some \u003c/a>of this vital evidence when it noted that Mateen was asking associates what would make people more upset: &#8220;an attack on downtown Disney or a club?” The paper added: &#8220;Mateen didn’t say &#8216;gay club,&#8217; according to court records.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The motion filed by Salman&#8217;s lawyers makes clear that in the days leading up to the Pulse attack, and indeed on the day of the attack itself, Mateen scoped out and considered numerous venues &#8212; such as Disney properties and shopping malls &#8212; none of which had any connection to the LGBT community or gay life. Moreover, once Mateen decided to attack nightclub, his phone records reveal that he searched for &#8220;Orlando nightclubs&#8221; &#8212; not &#8220;LGBT clubs&#8221; or &#8220;gay bars.&#8221; The relevant facts from the motion just filed this afternoon makes clear how dubious the widespread beliefs are about Mateen&#8217;s motives:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 540px;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/mateen-1520287988.png\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-article-medium wp-image-174532\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/mateen-1520287988-540x450.png\" alt=\"\" />\u003c/a> \u003c/div>\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 540px;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/pulse2-1520288005.png\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-article-medium wp-image-174533\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/pulse2-1520288005-540x445.png\" alt=\"\" />\u003c/a> \u003c/div>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cu>But even before\u003c/u> this evidence began to come to light, there was already abundant convincing evidence suggesting that anti-gay animus was not a significant part of Mateen&#8217;s motive in choosing Pulse and perhaps played no role at all. This evidence begins with Mateen&#8217;s own words.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As is true of most terrorists, Mateen was determined to ensure that the world knew the grievances and causes in whose name he was slaughtering innocent people. He accomplished this in multiple ways: a running stream of commentary during the shooting spree, multiple statements to law enforcement officials by telephone from inside Pulse, and Facebook postings he published shortly before the killings.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>All of these statements contain numerous, now-standard grievances about U.S. foreign policy that are commonly cited by Muslims who attack Americans: specifically, the use by the U.S. and its allies of widespread violence against Muslim civilians in the Middle East, and the perceived need to bring violence back to U.S. soil as a means of punishing past violence and deterring future aggression.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Many of Mateen&#8217;s statements are filled with the sorts of denunciations of U.S. violence in the region that are typically downplayed, if not outright ignored, when U.S. media examine why radical Muslims attack Americans. Mateen&#8217;s statements about his shooting spree contain pledges of loyalty to the Islamic State and praise for various radical groups. And \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/us/orlando-shooting.html\">some posts and statements professed\u003c/a> that he was martyring himself on behalf of Islam. But they exclusively emphasized one cause: the ongoing killing of Muslim civilians by the U.S.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Critically, what is missing from all of Mateen&#8217;s comments — from his online decrees, his talks with police negotiators during the attack, and statements made to his victims and survivors at the club — is glaring and revealing: At no point during the hours of his attack on Pulse did Mateen even mention, let alone rail against, LGBT people. Even as he massacred 49 people inside a gay club, surrounded by gay people, there were no reports from survivors that he had uttered a single anti-gay epithet or homophobic remark, or in any way referenced LGBT people. None of his statements explaining his motives and cause for the attack make any reference to targeting the gay community or any judgments about homosexuality.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The same is true of his extensive conversations with law enforcement officials and his Facebook postings regarding the shooting spree: They were filled with pledges of loyalty to ISIS and other extremist groups in the region, along with denunciations of U.S. aggression in the region, but not a single word about LGBT people. &#8220;You kill innocent women and children by doing us airstrikes,” Mateen \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/us/orlando-shooting.html\">wrote on Facebook\u003c/a>. “Now taste the Islamic state vengeance.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Indeed, while inside Pulse, his extensive discussions with police negotiators, who continually asked him what he wanted, focused exclusively on demands that the U.S., along with Russia, cease airstrikes and the killing of civilians in Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq. &#8220;Because you have to tell America to stop bombing Syria and Iraq. They are killing a lot of innocent people,&#8221; he said \u003ca href=\"https://info.publicintelligence.net/FL-OmarMateenTranscripts.pdf\">during his first call to 911\u003c/a>. &#8220;What am I to do here when my people are getting killed over there. &#8230; You need to stop the U.S. airstrikes. They need to stop the U.S. airstrikes, OK? . &#8230; This went down, a lot of innocent women and children are getting killed in Syria and Iraq and Afghanistan, OK? &#8230; The airstrikes need to stop and stop collaborating with Russia. OK?&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Mateen&#8217;s complete lack of any mention or reference to LGBT people during his hourslong shooting spree is not, of course, definitive proof that this was not part of his motive in attacking Pulse. But it&#8217;s certainly relevant, probative, and worthy of serious questioning. Given Mateen&#8217;s commitment in multiple venues to aggressively expressing his motives and causes, it is difficult to understand why — in the midst of an attack on a gay club — he would be utterly silent about his views on homosexuality and LGBT people, even as he opined on a wide array of other political issues to justify his attack. It is, at least, equally difficult to understand why Mateen&#8217;s systematic murder of dozens of gay people was never accompanied by any casual anti-gay slur or homophobic sentiment of any kind.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Adding to these questions is that FBI investigators insist that Mateen, in the days and weeks leading to the attack, had \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/before-orlando-shooters-routine-last-days-hints-of-instability-1465858489\">scoped out numerous other potential venues\u003c/a> — from Disney Parks to shopping malls. None had any connection to gay culture or LGBT people. Pulse seems to have been the only locale Mateen ever considered that had any connection to gay life.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>All of this has left investigators, and especially Salman&#8217;s lawyers, strongly suspecting that Mateen chose Pulse not because he wanted to target LGBT people, but because he sought a soft target full of people.  And he just so happened — perhaps without even knowing he was doing it — to choose a club that catered to the gay community.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Mateen never lived in Orlando; at the time of the attack, he lived in Fort Pierce, more than 100 miles from Orlando, a two-hour drive. There is no evidence he even knew that Pulse was a gay club. As for how he found Pulse, one patron present that night offered a plausible theory when she\u003ca href=\"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/pulse-orlando-nightclub-shooting/omar-mateen/os-pulse-omar-mateen-motive-20170512-story.html\"> told reporters\u003c/a> that she and her friends were strangers to the Orlando club scene and &#8220;picked Pulse because it came up first when they did a Google search for clubs in Orlando, with a five-star rating.&#8221; Mateen&#8217;s phone searches for the targets he considered attacking are part of what has remained sealed, but today&#8217;s filing strongly suggests that Mateen similarly chose Pulse in much the same way.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As the FBI investigation proceeded, some corrective reports in the U.S. media began to emerge, but they were often downplayed and given nowhere near the prominence with which the early, erroneous reports were hyped. Roughly one month after the shooting, the Washington Post, \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/no-evidence-so-far-to-suggest-orlando-shooter-targeted-club-because-it-was-gay/2016/07/14/a7528674-4907-11e6-acbc-4d4870a079da_story.html?utm_term=.aa5c660d8570\">citing unnamed\u003c/a> &#8220;U.S. law enforcement officials,&#8221; reported that &#8220;the FBI has found no evidence so far that Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people and wounded more than 53 at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, chose the popular establishment because of its gay clientele.&#8221; The Post added, quoting a law enforcement official, that “while there can be no denying the significant impact on the gay community, the investigation hasn’t revealed that he targeted Pulse because it was a gay club.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And now, almost 18 months later, as the trial of Mateen&#8217;s wife is beginning, that evidentiary absence remains unhanged. As the Orlando Sentinel \u003ca href=\"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/pulse-orlando-nightclub-shooting/omar-mateen/os-pulse-omar-mateen-motive-20170512-story.html\">put it\u003c/a> in June of last year, &#8220;there’s still no evidence that the Pulse killer intended to target gay people.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And yet the popular belief persists — often finding its way into official pronouncements, LGBT group materials, and media discussions — that the Pulse shooting represented a deliberate, concerted attack &#8212; a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; &#8212; on the LGBT community due to homophobia. At least in part for this reason, the LGBT community, particularly in Orlando, has appeared to be virtually united in their intense desire to see Mateen&#8217;s wife prosecuted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It should go without saying that none of these questions about Mateen&#8217;s motive remotely mitigates the evil of the attack. But it is crucial to understand the truth of what happened, and not to allow a politically valuable narrative — one that some have attempted to use to drive a wedge between Muslim and LGBT communities, and one that seems to be driving a desire to see Mateen&#8217;s wife punished — to continue to prevail if it is, in fact, false.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cu>The belief that\u003c/u> Mateen purposely set out to kill gay people emerged very early on in the media&#8217;s reporting on the attack. The Guardian, in the days following the attack, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/14/latino-hispanic-orlando-shooting-victims\">quoted one survivor\u003c/a>: &#8220;My sense is that this man was a fundamentalist, and he just chose, for whatever reason, to go after the LGBT community – and to go on Latin night, so it was a two-fer.” Such sentiments were commonplace throughout media reports.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-right  width-fixed' style='width: 440px;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/AP_910243764844-1-1520281097.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-174467\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/AP_910243764844-1-1520281097-440x340.jpg\" alt=\"Mourners visit a makeshift memorial, in front of the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, for victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting, Saturday, June 25, 2016, in Orlando, Fla.

Ebenhack/AP\u003c/p>\u003c/div>And back then, and still to a large extent now, one working theory was that Mateen himself was either gay or struggling with homosexuality. Likely due to his Muslim beliefs, he harbored self-hatred and disgust for his own sexual orientation that finally exploded with violence toward other gay people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Within days of the attack, the media deluged the public with all sorts of claims strongly suggesting that Mateen was gay. Reports emerged that he had \u003ca href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-orlando-nightclub-shooting-20160613-snap-story.html\">used gay dating apps such as Grindr\u003c/a> to find sex partners. Several Pulse patrons \u003ca href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-orlando-nightclub-shooting-20160613-snap-story.html\">insisted they had seen him\u003c/a> at the club previously. His first wife, whom he had abused, \u003ca href=\"http://time.com/4369577/orlando-shooting-sitora-yusufiy-omar-mateen-gay/\">speculated\u003c/a> that he may be gay, telling Time: &#8220;He would take a long time in front of the mirror, he would often take pictures of himself, and he made little movements with his body that definitely made me question things. It definitely popped up in my head whether he was totally straight.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That closeted gay men develop self-hatred which often finds expression in severe animosity and even violence toward gay people is well-established in the social sciences. It has become popularized in the discourse surrounding homophobia. As a result, this image of Mateen as self-hating gay man quickly resonated as a way of explaining an incomprehensible act of evil. That he was Muslim added to the seeming plausibility: It has become \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/06/13/stop-exploiting-lgbt-issues-to-demonize-islam-and-justify-anti-muslim-policies/\">an increasingly common tactic\u003c/a> among some Western anti-Islam commentators to insist that Muslim culture and gay rights are incompatible — all that \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/06/13/stop-exploiting-lgbt-issues-to-demonize-islam-and-justify-anti-muslim-policies/\">despite polling data showing\u003c/a> that American Muslims are more accepting of gay people and gay civil rights than several other large religious groups.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>ISIS, whose name Mateen invoked on several occasions during the shooting, added fuel to the fire that Mateen&#8217;s motive was to kill gay people when they \u003ca href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/omar-mateen-orlando-nightclub-shooting-pulse-2016-6\">issued a statement\u003c/a> claiming responsibility and noting that &#8220;the victims were all in &#8216;a nightclub for homosexuals.'&#8221; Another ISIS statement \u003ca href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/isis-claims-responsibility-orlando-gay-nightclub-shooting-florida-attack-omar-mateen-gunman-a7079721.html\">declared\u003c/a> he was one of its soldiers who had managed &#8220;to enter a crusader gathering at a nightclub for homosexuals.&#8221; Yet investigators could find no connection between Mateen and ISIS other than his pledge to the group during the shooting, and ISIS has notoriously claimed responsibility for attackers who, though &#8220;inspired&#8221; by their message, did nothing to coordinate or even notify the group in advance of the attack.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-right  width-fixed' style='width: 440px;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/AP_16204696785236-1520279773.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-174460\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/AP_16204696785236-1520279773-440x440.jpg\" alt=\"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, accompanied by Sen.

Chad Griffin, the head of the largest LGBT advocacy group, Human Rights Campaign, \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/12/human-rights-campaign-pulse-nightclub-shooting-response\">said\u003c/a>, &#8220;The maniac who did this was somehow conditioned to believe that LGBT people deserve to be massacred, that they are ‘less than’ in this society.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Then-candidate Hillary Clinton said during her visit to Orlando that, while an act of terror, the Pulse massacre &#8220;was also an act of hate,&#8221; adding that &#8220;the gunman attacked an LGBT nightclub during Pride Month.&#8221; She vowed: &#8220;We will keep fighting for your right to live freely, openly and without fear. Hate has absolutely no place in America.” Speaking in Orlando, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said that it is &#8220;a cruel irony that a community defined almost exclusively by whom they love [LGBT people] is so often a target of hate.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That Mateen attacked Pulse as an act of anti-gay hatred was implicit in the discourse in the days following the traumatic attack. And that remains just as true today.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But over time, as investigators scrutinized every aspect of Mateen&#8217;s in-person and digital life and tracked down every last lead, all of these claims about Mateen&#8217;s sexual orientation collapsed. FBI investigators ultimately concluded that there was no truth whatsoever to the theory that Mateen was gay — closeted or otherwise. To the contrary, they uncovered ample evidence that he was cheating on his wife with numerous women.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As the New York Times described on June 18, &#8220;Mateen used a dating website to seek a relationship with a woman in Fort Pierce. He churned through usernames — “makeitlovelylol” among them — and lied about his age, according to the woman, who requested anonymity but who provided photos that she had saved from his dating profile.&#8221; Indeed, &#8220;at one point, she said, Mr. Mateen’s pursuit veered toward stalking. He began messaging her to say he was nearby. He knew the color of her car and the general location of her place of employment.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While there is extensive evidence of Mateen&#8217;s womanizing &#8212; including his use of a friend to hide his infidelities from his wife &#8212; there is no evidence regarded by the FBI as credible that Mateen was gay. Indeed, Mateen had never visited any of the gay bars near his home, as Time reported in mid-June: &#8220;Nobody recalled ever seeing him at TattleTails, a gay bar just a few miles from his apartment. In three gay bars in West Palm Beach, an hour from Mateen’s home, none of the bartenders or customers told TIME they remembered ever seeing him.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Forensic investigations into Mateen&#8217;s computers and accounts revealed no online activity that would suggest any gay interests. The Los Angeles Times, on June 23, reported that &#8220;the FBI has found no evidence so far to support claims by those who say Mateen had gay lovers or communicated on gay dating apps, several law enforcement officials said. &#8230; In seeking to verify the reports, federal agents have culled Mateen&#8217;s electronic devices, including a laptop computer and cellphone, as well as electronic communications of those who made the claims. &#8230; So far, they have found no photographs, no text messages, no smartphone apps, no gay pornography and no cell-tower location data to suggest that Mateen — who was twice married to women and had a young son — conducted a secret gay life, the officials said.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As the investigation proceeded, the original belief that Mateen was gay appeared less and less plausible, as the New York Times noted: &#8220;F.B.I. investigators, who have conducted more than 500 interviews in the case, are continuing to contact men who claim to have had sexual relations with Mr. Mateen or think they saw him at gay bars. But so far, they have not found any independent corroboration — through his web searches, emails or other electronic data — to establish that he was, in fact, gay, officials said.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Indeed, the only evidence found linking Mateen to any gay people itself negated the theory that Mateen was filled with homophobia. As The Guardian \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/14/orlando-shooter-omar-mateen-was-a-regular-at-nightclub\">explained\u003c/a> on June 14: &#8220;His former classmate Samuel King, who also worked at the same shopping mall as Mateen after high school, said Mateen had known that he and many of his friends were gay but never expressed any disapproval. “He had to know it, but I never got any sense of homophobia or aggression from him,” he told the Washington Post.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cu>Despite this mountain\u003c/u> of evidence that strongly negates the original media-disseminated themes about Mateen&#8217;s life and his likely motive in targeting Pulse, the early myths remain lodged in the public mind and even in contemporary news reports. In part that&#8217;s because much of the evidence has remained under seal, in part because subsequent media debunking received a tiny fraction of the attention of the early, aggressively hyped inflammatory theories, and in part because there has been no political advantage to challenging the politically moving and useful narrative that the attack on Pulse was a hate crime against gay people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As Salman&#8217;s trial is about to begin, it is thus commonplace to find these cleary debunked theories asserted as fact in the largest media outlets. Matthew Todd, writing in The Guardian \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/08/self-loathing-gay-people-shame\">just last month,\u003c/a> explained that &#8220;self-loathing can turn deadly. Omar Mateen, who committed America’s most deadly homophobic attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida in 2016, pledged his allegiance to Isis but was also \u003ca class=\"u-underline\" title=\"\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/14/orlando-shooter-omar-mateen-was-a-regular-at-nightclub\">alleged to have made sexual advances towards men\u003c/a>. His ex-wife said she believed he was gay.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The LGBT journal The Advocate, in an article \u003ca href=\"https://www.advocate.com/crime/2018/3/01/nearly-two-years-after-pulse-massacre-trial-omar-mateens-widow-begins\">last week\u003c/a> on the imminent trial of Mateen&#8217;s wife claimed that &#8220;searches of Mateen’s personal computer also indicate that he had visited the website for Pulse, and witnesses say he \u003ca href=\"https://www.advocate.com/crime/2016/6/13/rumor-or-real-man-says-shooter-messaged-him-grindr\" target=\"_blank\">visited the club on numerous occasions\u003c/a>.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Driven by this belief that the attack on Pulse was intended to target LGBT people, demanding severe punishment for Mateen&#8217;s wife has become a cause among many gay activists.

As the Humane Society \u003ca href=\"http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/campaigns/factory_farming/\">put it\u003c/a> after an \u003ca href=\"http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/confinement_farm/facts/battery_cages.html\">extensive investigation\u003c/a> into the indescribable cruelties of this industry, &#8220;Perhaps the most abused farm animals, nearly 280 million laying hens in the United States are confined in barren wire battery cages so restrictive the birds can&#8217;t even spread their wings.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As consumers have awoken to the barbaric conditions of the egg industry, they have begun to turn toward incrementally more humane alternatives, such as cage-free eggs, as well as truly humane options, such as eggs from pasture-raised hens at places like Vital Farms.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">The market, as they say, is speaking. As Americans become more educated about the morally repellent practices of this industry, they are increasingly refusing to reward barbaric practices by buying eggs that are the byproduct of industrial torture. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003ciframe width='100%' height='400px' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/DrGQTyrIFLA' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen>\u003c/iframe>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">But in response, the powerful poultry industry &#8212; which long invoked principles of the &#8220;free market&#8221; to justify their torture-derived products being available to consumers &#8212; have now reversed course. With consumers choosing more humane egg products, lobbyists for the poultry industry are pushing laws that would \u003cem>force\u003c/em> stores to carry their products even if doing so offends their moral sensibilities and ethical judgments.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p3\">\u003cspan class=\"s2\">In Iowa, the nation’s biggest egg-producing state, lawmakers, at the behest of the poultry lobby, are making their most brazen attempt yet to fight the tides of change: simply making it a legal requirement for grocery stores to carry inhumanely produced eggs. \u003c/span>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">A \u003ca href=\"https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=HF%202408\">new bill\u003c/a> in the Iowa state legislature, \u003ca href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/26/bill-requiring-competition-cage-free-eggs-passes-iowa-house/375731002/\">overwhelmingly passed\u003c/a> by the Iowa House of Representatives on Monday by a vote of 81-17, would force any Iowa grocery store that participates in the Women, Infants and Children federal food assistance program and sells what the bill refers to as “specialty eggs” to also stock “conventional eggs.” “Specialty eggs” are cage-free eggs, free-range eggs, or “enriched colony cage” eggs — eggs produced in larger cages with perches and other amenities in them. “Conventional eggs” are eggs from hens \u003ca href=\"http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/confinement_farm/facts/battery_cages.html\">confined in battery cages\u003c/a>.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p5\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">The bill’s supporters frame the measure as a consumer choice issue, arguing that the most economically destitute Iowans deserve access to lower priced eggs. Animal welfare advocates view the motivation differently.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p3\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">“These bills are designed to keep a dying industry afloat that consumers no longer want to support,” said Cody Carlson, an attorney at Mercy for Animals. “This is an industry that refuses to change in any meaningful way.”\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\"> In 2010, Carlson worked at two industrial egg farms in Iowa, covertly documenting the inhumane practices employed in egg production as an undercover investigator. He and his co-workers, he told The Intercept\u003ci>, \u003c/i>would walk down vast rows of battery cages looking for mummified bird corpses stuck to the floors. The cages were about the size of a microwave, with seven to 10 hens crammed into each one. The floors were made of an abrasive wire mesh, so when birds died &#8212; often from thirst or starvation after their confinement had debilitated their muscles and bones, rendering them paralyzed &#8212; the live hens would stand on top of the decaying carcasses to give their feet some relief. Workers like Carlson were responsible for removing the trampled carcasses.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">“We called it ‘pulling carpets,’” he said.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1024px;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/farmphoto-1519995197.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-173935\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/farmphoto-1519995197-1024x578.jpg\" alt=\"farmphoto-1519995197\" />\u003c/a> \u003cp class='caption source' style=''>Photo: Mercy for Animals\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">“It was common at the places I worked to find hens whose wings, legs, necks, and prolapsed ova became caught in the wires, condemning them to excruciating, prolonged deaths by dehydration or trampling by their cage-mates,” Carlson told The Intercept in an email. The “ova” that he refers to is the chicken equivalent of a uterus, which commonly prolapses because they are bred to produce so many eggs. “When I pointed this out to my supervisor and offered to help untangle some of the hens, I was told this wasn’t our job and should wait until they died to remove them,” Carlson added.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">The cages Carlson worked among were stacked 12 feet high and extended for 200 yards. The hens were so tightly packed that each one had less floor space than the surface of an iPad upon which to spend her entire life. They couldn’t spread their wings, and by the time they were a year old, “they are raw and featherless from rubbing up against each other and the cage wires,” Carlson noted. He added:\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote>\n\u003cp class=\"p3\">\u003cspan class=\"s2\">W\u003c/span>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">ith nothing to do all day, the birds would naturally begin pecking each other out of boredom. Rather than alleviate their stress by giving them more space, the industry’s response is to ‘debeak’ them, painfully severing the ends of their beaks (which are filled with nerve endings) with a hot iron. With this procedure, they still go mad from mental and physical deprivation, but lack the ability to act out. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p3\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Because male chickens don’t lay eggs and aren’t bred to grow as fast as broiler hens, they are useless to the industry. Typically, they are tossed into a machine that grinds them alive or are tossed into a large plastic bag where they are left to suffocate.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">The two facilities Carlson worked in were not marginal, fly-by-night operations; they were owned by two of the biggest egg producers in the country. The conditions he witnessed on a daily basis are typical of the industry.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">It would be a challenge to purposely design torture methods that would inflict more pain and suffering on hens than those used at the largest industrial egg factories in the U.S. This has been one of the most challenging issues of animal cruelty to arouse public concern, because chickens are commonly perceived to be less intelligent and less emotionally complex than dogs, pigs, or even cows, making it somehow more morally justified, or at least less personally painful, to inflict excruciating pain on them for life. Precisely for that reason, the standard practices at egg farms are among the most savage and torturous in the animal farm industry.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">One undercover video produced by Mercy for Animals revealed such shocking images that the company, Eggland&#8217;s Best, \u003ca href=\"https://www.egglandsbest.com/%3Fpost_type%3Dnews%26p%3D3158\">announced\u003c/a> it was &#8220;setting a goal of working with our suppliers and customers to transition to 100 percent cage-free eggs by 2025,&#8221; and claimed it &#8220;has been at the forefront of egg industry best practices in a number of areas, including food safety, bird health, animal welfare, and 3rd party audit requirements.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003ciframe width='100%' height='400px' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/J25aTS8MFG0' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen>\u003c/iframe>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Despite some recent, isolated reforms, severe abuses throughout the industry remain commonplace, even as a full ban on battery cages for egg-laying hens \u003ca href=\"http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2012/01/european-union-bans-battery-cages-for-egg-laying-hens/#.WplTCZPwZE4\">took effect\u003c/a> in the European Union in 2012. The Humane Society \u003ca href=\"http://m.humanesociety.org/issues/confinement_farm/facts/cage-free_vs_battery-cage.html\">reports\u003c/a> that &#8220;the vast majority of egg-laying hens in the United States are confined in battery cages.&#8221;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">“There is no more tortured farm animal than a hen in a cage,” said Matthew O’Hayer, the founder of \u003ca href=\"https://vitalfarms.com/\">\u003cspan class=\"s4\">Vital Farms\u003c/span>\u003c/a>, a producer of certified humane, pasture-raised eggs. &#8220;If you visit a caged operation, there’s a chance you’ll never eat another egg in your life.”\u003c/span>\u003cspan class=\"s5\">\u003cbr />\n\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cu>Undercover investigators like\u003c/u> Carlson have helped to bring this reality to consumers, creating a market for more humane alternatives and an appetite among voters for reform.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">In 2008, California voters\u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/24/us/24egg.html\"> approved the nation’s first law specifically reforming\u003c/a> conditions for hens in the egg industry. The ballot initiative, Proposition 2, passed in a landslide, and it prohibited the state’s egg producers from confining hens in enclosures too small to allow them to turn around, stand up, lie down, and stretch their limbs. The initiative did the same for pregnant sows and veal calves.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Before the measure went into effect in 2015, egg-laying hens in California were typically crammed into battery cages exactly like the ones Carlson worked with in Iowa. The new standards provided a modicum of relief to millions of California hens.\u003cbr />\n\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">The expenses required to comply with the new regulations, however, put the state’s egg farmers at a competitive disadvantage with out-of-state producers that sold their eggs in California stores. So the following year, to level the playing field, the California legislature adopted a new law that extended those standards to all eggs sold in the state, regardless of whether they were laid in a California facility or shipped from another state. Together, the ballot initiative and its successor bill constituted the codification of a new consumer awareness of the conditions that prevail in industrial egg production, and a new public willingness to compel producers to adopt more humane practices.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Since Prop 2’s passage, elected officials in Iowa and other egg-producing states have been vigorously fighting to undercut those laws in order to preserve access to California’s massive consumer market for their own egg producers — without requiring them to invest in better conditions for their hens. In 2013, Iowa’s Republican Rep. Steve King proposed an amendment to the federal Farm Bill that would have prevented any state from imposing standards on the production of agricultural goods created in another state — a measure explicitly aimed at nullifying the standards set by California’s Prop 2. The amendment failed.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">In 2016, Iowa’s governor, along with the attorneys general of five other states, sued California’s then-State Attorney General Kamala Harris and the Humane Society, seeking to block enforcement of Prop 2. The suit was dismissed at the district court level and on appeal, and the Supreme Court declined to hear it.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">These successes have spurred advocates for ending animal cruelty to propose legislation for even more humane conditions. California’s legislators are now \u003ca href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB3021\">\u003cspan class=\"s4\">proposing\u003c/span>\u003c/a> to expand Prop 2’s minimum cage size yet further, and activists are pushing a new California ballot initiative that would \u003ca href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-cage-free-eggs-ballot-initiative-20170829-story.html\">\u003cspan class=\"s6\">require the state’s entire industry to go cage-free.\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">As the egg industry failed in its effort to undermine the voters’ will in California, the expanding national market for at least marginally more ethical eggs prompted 100 grocery store chains and dozens of chain restaurants and food manufacturers — Nestlé, McDonald’s, and Walmart among them — \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/11/us-stopped-caging-hens-uk-retailers-cage-free\">to pledge to abandon\u003c/a> caged eggs over the next decade. This is an important development because these outlets collectively comprise 70 percent of consumer demand in the United States.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cu>Caged egg producers\u003c/u> and their political allies, running short on options to stem the contraction of the market for caged eggs, are now resorting to extreme measures, including the outright abandonment of the free-market principles they once heralded as sacrosanct. In Iowa, the strategy of these corporations now rests on overriding the demands of the market and empowering the government to \u003ci>dictate\u003c/i> to stores what they must sell — in particular, barring them from refusing to sell eggs that are the products of grotesque cruelty.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">It’s an ironic position, because this kind of intervention in the private sector was exactly what politicians like King accused the state of California of doing with the passage of Prop 2. O’Hayer, the Vital Farms founder, explained that when California voters adopted the animal rights measure, “the response was that we should let consumers make their own choices, and you can’t boss them around.” Now that consumers are choosing humane treatment of hens, that free-market principle has been kicked to the curb.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">“It’s extremely hypocritical that Iowa’s factory farmers have pretended for a long time to care about protecting the free market,” said Chris Holbein of the Humane Society, “because now that the free market is turning against them and in favor of more responsible producers that are trying to do the right thing for consumers and animals, the factory producers want the government to force grocery stores to sell a product that is both unsafe and unethical.”\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">Becky Higgins, a small poultry farmer in Iowa, \u003ca href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/iowa-view/2018/02/20/iowa-legislature-tell-grocers-what-kind-eggs-they-can-sell/355510002/\">explained in the Des Moines Register\u003c/a> that the bill just passed by the Iowa House will harm small farmers, the environment, consumer choice, consumer health, and humane treatment of animals &#8212; essentially, everyone except big industrial agriculture to which Iowa state legislators are subservient:\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">Our state leaders are poised to consider legislation that would hurt Iowa family farmers like myself and consumers who support farming practices that are sustainable, humane and ethical. &#8230; These factory farms harm not only the animals, but also the environment and the viability of our rural communities. As a proud Iowa egg producer and small sustainable and traditional family farmer, I know firsthand just how harmful industrial animal agriculture has been to the Iowa way of life.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">Now, disastrous bills are being discreetly and quickly moved through the Iowa Legislature. Sponsored by lawmakers beholden to corporate agribusiness interests, this legislation would force most grocery stores to sell eggs from hens cruelly confined in tiny, barren battery cages. A growing number of farmers like myself have dedicated their lives to raising the standard of care for our animals and employees, while producing safe, wholesome products. Like me, many of my fellow farmers across the state have converted to cage-free systems, and others opted to never use cages from the beginning. Cage-free production is more humane, better for the environment, and produces a safer, tastier, healthier egg. &#8230;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">In addition to supporting the continued use of inhumane battery cages, these dangerous bills will also increase food safety risks for Iowa families. Extensive research has shown higher rates of the harmful bacteria salmonella in eggs from caged hens versus eggs from cage-free hens. The stressful living conditions and inability of caged hens to move lowers their immune systems, making the transfer of disease more likely. A  major industry trade publication, Poultry World, wrote that “salmonella thrives in cage housing.” If the industry itself admits battery cage eggs are more dangerous, why on earth would they knowingly subject Iowa families to higher food safety risks?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p-text\">For as long as I can remember, industrial animal agriculture has been trying to stop any regulation of extreme cruelty by saying that the “free market should decide,” yet now that the free market is rejecting the worst forms of factory farming practices, industrial agribusinesses is demanding that the government bail them out and take a share of the market away from more humane and responsible farmers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p-text\">The government has no place mandating that grocers must sell a product that family farmers, businesses and consumers reject.\u003c/p>\n\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Neither the bill&#8217;s legislative sponsors nor the Iowa Poultry Association responded to requests for comment.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Animal rights activists have succeeded in making greater sectors of the public aware of, and repelled by, the extreme cruelty and barbarism of industrial farming corporations in the U.S. But these corporations still wield one last weapon, and it is a potent one: the ability to use their financial muscle and lobbying power to dictate laws, particularly in farming states. Their latest ploy demonstrates how desperate they have become — but also how powerful they remain. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">Consumers have their own power: their refusal to reward industrial farms and corporations for imposing gratuitous and incomprehensible suffering on living beings by purchasing their products. That is now one of the primary fronts animal rights activists view as a key to ensuring more humane treatment for animals in the U.S. and abroad.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">Top photo: Chickens stand in their cages at a large industrial egg production farm in Pennsylvania.

The campaign was designed to ruin the careers of Arab professors by equating their criticisms of Israel with racism, anti-Semitism, and bullying, and its central demand was that those professors (some of whom lacked tenure) be disciplined for their transgressions.

Though the investigative committee found \u003cem>one instance\u003c/em> in which it said a professor had become excessively angry at a student&#8217;s defense of Israel, it concluded that it found &#8220;no evidence of any statements made by the faculty that could reasonably be construed as anti-Semitic.&#8221; The report, ironically, did find a campaign of intimidation &#8212; aimed \u003cem>at \u003c/em>the Arab professors, not from them; it &#8220;describe[d] a broader environment of incivility on campus, with pro-Israel students disrupting lectures on Middle Eastern studies and some faculty members feeling that they were being spied on&#8221; &#8212; the very behavior Weiss now denounces when it comes from her ideological opponents.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As Cole noted, the report found that the kind of systematic harassment Weiss now pretends to find so objectionable was actually directed at these Arab professors by her own ideological comrades:\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote>\u003cp>Although it was little noted in the press, the report did indeed acknowledge that Massad in particular and the department in general had been the target of an ongoing campaign of intimidation. It noted that for several years, after pieces appeared in the tabloid press blasting the department as anti-Israel, many non-students, clearly hostile and with ideological agendas, had been attending classes in the department, interrupting lectures with hostile asides and inhibiting classroom debate.\u003c/p>\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>When the report was issued clearing these professors of virtually all the charges leveled against them and finding instead that they were the victims rather than the perpetrators of harassment campaigns, Weiss was furious and held press conferences and demonstrations to denounce it:\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 540px;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/weiss1-1520512206.png\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-article-medium wp-image-175073\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/weiss1-1520512206-540x434.png\" alt=\"\" />\u003c/a> \u003c/div>\n\u003cp>(4)\u003cstrong> \u003c/strong>Unfortunately for Weiss, her attempts now to revise her own history are rendered impossible by her own remarks about her activism, filmed years before she knew she would be at the center of this type of attention.

I won&#8217;t go into all the details of this case &#8212; I wrote about it at length in that original article and it was also the subject of very lengthy reporting \u003ca href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/04/14/the-petition\">in the New Yorker\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/10/education/10barnard.html?mcubz=3\">the New York Times\u003c/a> &#8212; but the gist of it is crucial for understanding who Weiss really is and how false are her denials from last night.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In sum, Abu El-Haj was a rising academic star at the University of Chicago who was on a fast track toward tenure. Her 2002 book anthropologically examining Jewish claims to a biblical entitlement of Israel won numerous awards and praise from scholars across many disciplines. In 2006, she moved to New York and applied for a tenured position at Barnard; it was widely assumed, given her sterling reputation, that her acceptance would be automatic &#8212; until an Israeli settler in the West Bank started an online petition demanding that she be denied tenure due to her 2002 book about Israel.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That online petition led to an incredibly ugly attempt to smear her as an anti-Semite who used shoddy scholarship to question Israeli claims, and &#8212; needless to say &#8212; Weiss was a vocal supporter of this effort. Pretending that she was concerned about Abu El-Haj&#8217;s academic abilities rather than her views on Israel &#8212; as though Weiss were even remotely capable of assessing Abu El-Haj&#8217;s anthropological and archeological methods &#8212; Weiss wrote an article in Haaretz \u003ca href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/facts-in-the-air-1.234213\">arguing that\u003c/a> the fight over Abu El-Haj&#8217;s tenure “is not just another round between the Zionists and the anti-Zionists,” but instead, “is about the nature of truth, and the possibility of, well, facts themselves.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 540px;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/weissarch-1520513132.png\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-article-medium wp-image-175074\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/weissarch-1520513132-540x481.png\" alt=\"\" />\u003c/a> \u003c/div>\n\u003cp>For someone who purports to be such a devoted adherent to pluralism and free expression on college campuses, Weiss sure does have a tendency to find a large number of Arab and Muslim scholars who are critical of Israel who she believes deserve sanction, vilification, punishment, and denial of career advancement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I&#8217;m someone who strongly believes in the right of people to change their views and to evolve. My first book, which began by describing my own political and intellectual journey, started with this quote from Abraham Lincoln: &#8220;I do not think much of a man who is not wiser today than he was yesterday.&#8221; And I find some of the concerns about prevailing viewpoint intolerance on college campuses to be valid, or at least reasonable.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If Weiss would acknowledge that she spent years engaged in the precise types of censorship and vilification campaigns that she has now come to regard as so menacing, I would find that admission admirable, not objectionable. But she&#8217;s doing the opposite: She&#8217;s denying that her activities were geared toward exactly the climate of intimidation and censorship against which she now crusades. Perhaps it&#8217;s possible that she&#8217;s just in a state of denial, incapable of admitting that she built her career based on exactly the types of activities that she now so vocally denounces.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But what seems far more likely is that, like so many people, Weiss finds censorship and vilification objectionable only when it&#8217;s directed at her, her friends, and the viewpoints she supports. In particular, it is this mentality that explains why left-wing attacks on racism, fascism, and other authoritarian views on campus receive so much attention from America&#8217;s pundit class, while the \u003ca href=\"https://ccrjustice.org/the-palestine-exception\">most pervasive form of campus censorship\u003c/a> &#8212; \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/09/25/dianne-feinstein-husband-threaten-univ-calif-demanding-ban-excessive-israel-criticism/\">directed at Israel critics and pro-Palestinian activists\u003c/a> &#8212; is so often ignored. In Bari Weiss, the New York Times seems to have found the perfect embodiment of this free speech double standard.

When she called to find out more, a man named Gilberto urged her to come into work that same day.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“He said he could pay me $11 an hour for a 10-hour day for six days a week, including Saturdays, with no overtime.” Lopez recalled. “But I was OK with what he offered because I really needed the work.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>She spent the next two weeks on a crew of mostly immigrant laborers, demolishing walls and carrying out trash, then “putting up sheetrock with the guys and caulking and even cutting up siding” on buildings. A 20-year-old undocumented immigrant from Honduras, she had never worked in construction before, but she learned quickly and “just focused on getting the work done.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Halfway into her third week on the job, Lopez fell from a ladder that shifted as she was stepping down. At the hospital, a doctor told her she had ripped the tendons in her ankle. Lopez was stuck with the bill, and then, she says, “The company didn’t want to pay me for the time I had worked.” Others at the site were also waiting to be paid; some had been waiting for more than a month.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When Lopez complained, Gilberto gave her the phone number of the subcontractor handling the project. The man who answered the phone told her “he would pay me some of the money soon,” she recalled. “But I told him I needed all of the money because I’d had an accident and had bills to pay.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>She informed him that other workers were contacting lawyers in order to get paid and says he responded, “Do what you have to do,” and hung up.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Workers like Lopez lost thousands of dollars in the first month after Hurricane Harvey, according to a \u003ca href=\"https://greatcities.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/After-the-Storm_Theodore_2017.pdf\">report\u003c/a> commissioned by the Fe y Justicia Worker Center and the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, which found that more than a quarter of laborers doing recovery work in Houston had experienced wage theft since the storm. “After a natural disaster, there’s this huge risk of not only keeping the status quo of inequalities, but actually making them a lot worse,” said Marianela Acuña-Arreaza, executive director of the Fe y Justicia Worker Center.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The survey of storm recovery workers showed they were primarily undocumented immigrants from Mexico and Central America, although most were long-term residents of the Houston area. As The Intercept \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/11/13/hurricane-harvey-houston-immigrant-construction-workers/\">documented\u003c/a> in November, a state law that lets police request the immigration status of anyone they detain or arrest has made many workers reluctant to report abuse. This week, the U.S. 5th Circuit ruled that most of the law can take effect even while it is appealed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the meantime, in a rare success, Lopez actually recovered the money she was owed — about $1,000. Labor advocates helped her bypass the web of subcontractors and directly pressure the project’s general contractor, \u003ca href=\"https://www.interstaterestoration.com/\">Interstate Restoration\u003c/a>, the second-largest disaster recovery firm in North America.

He estimated the company would have over 500 people working in the Houston area, and over 5,000 vendors and subcontractors.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Search and rescue and kind of the basic needs gets all the media attention,” Mazur noted. “But really, the hard work starts here in a couple of weeks once that dies down, and it’s billions of dollars’ worth of remediation and restoration that will take place.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Interstate focuses on commercial properties, which are usually covered by business interruption insurance that allows work to begin immediately, and Mazur said the company had contracts to repair “a real mixed bag of damage,” including apartment complexes, hotels, car dealerships, and banks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As the 2017 hurricane season continued with Hurricane Irma, the company sent \u003ca href=\"http://realtynewsreport.com/2017/10/31/inside-look-how-stacy-mazur-is-restoring-buildings-damaged-in-harvey-maria-and-the-napa-fires/\">150 workers to Florida\u003c/a> and added 500 subcontractors. When Hurricane Maria devastated the Caribbean, Interstate issued a \u003ca href=\"https://www.interstaterestoration.com/press-releases/interstate-restoration-jetting-rescue-caribbean\">press release\u003c/a> estimating that its work on the islands of Puerto Rico, St. Thomas, St. Kitts, and St. Martin, where its clients owned property, “could translate into a 5-10 percent increase in annual business.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A CNBC \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/26/investors-start-cleaning-up-with-disaster-recovery-boom.html\">report\u003c/a> on the “disaster-recovery boom” after the three storms called water damage from hurricanes “a cash cow and a growing industry,” citing a \u003ca href=\"http://www.cleanfax-digital.com/July2017#&amp;pageSet=6&amp;contentItem\">survey\u003c/a> of contractors in which water-damage restoration topped the list as the most profitable service they could offer. According to the report, some of the biggest players in the industry are “large private firms that are gobbling up smaller ones to create large national and worldwide networks better equipped to work with insurance companies’ third-party administrators.” This includes Interstate.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Mazur co-founded Interstate in 1998 with his brother Clay Mazur, the managing partner at Mazur Capital, which claims to “reinvigorate businesses, buildings, and urban spaces” through “win-win capitalization strategies.” It now does business under the name \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/companies/1129121D:US-bellwether-international-group-llc\">Bellwether International Group\u003c/a>, whose chair, Jeff Johnson, co-founded Belfor USA, one of the world’s largest disaster recovery firms.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In a 2006 \u003ca href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/seeking-justice/case-docket/rodrigues-et-al-v-belfor-usa-group-inc\">settlement\u003c/a> after Hurricane Katrina, Belfor agreed to pay $223,000 to 163 migrant workers who alleged the firm “unlawfully used a subcontractor system to avoid paying any overtime wages” for 12-hour days of cleaning mold and mud from Tulane University. The Department of Homeland Security later \u003ca href=\"https://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/GrantReports/2015/OIG_15-01-D_Oct14.pdf\">audited\u003c/a> the contract approved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and slammed Belfor for adding “$35 million in excessive and prohibited markups” that FEMA couldn’t prove were incurred.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In 2007, Interstate was acquired by \u003ca href=\"http://www.mbhe.com/\">MBHE Holdings\u003c/a>, a private equity and venture capital firm that Johnson also co-founded. He later \u003ca href=\"http://cfcanada.fticonsulting.com/firstonsite/docs/FOS%20Responding%20Motion%20Record%20returnable%20May%2026%202016.pdf\">supported\u003c/a> Interstate’s acquisition of Canada’s largest disaster recovery services company, \u003ca href=\"https://www.interstaterestoration.com/blog/interstate-restoration-acquires-canada%E2%80%99s-largest-independent-disaster-restoration-company-first\">FirstOnSite Restoration\u003c/a>, noting that several key members of Interstate’s team had been Belfor senior executives. The expansion came with help from another private equity firm, \u003ca href=\"http://deloscap.com/about-us/\">Delos Capital\u003c/a>, which acquired Interstate in October 2015.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>With each acquisition can come pressure to deliver higher returns, according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, which \u003ca href=\"http://cepr.net/documents/publications/private-equity-2012-02.pdf\">describes\u003c/a> private equity as a lightly regulated alternative investment mechanism “that most directly affects the management of, and employment relations in, operating companies that employ millions of U.S. workers.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In a company acquired by a private equity fund, the goal is often “to cut costs at all costs,” said Chad Gray, research coordinator at the Workers Defense Project, a Texas-based nonprofit that advocates for low-income laborers. “That could trickle down to squeeze the pool of money for contractors to offer subcontractors and drive down prices.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 944px;'>\u003cbr />\n\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/Interstate-Restoration-LLC-Timesheets_Redacted-7-1520534474.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-175168\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/Interstate-Restoration-LLC-Timesheets_Redacted-7-1520534474-944x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption overlayed\">Workers Defense Project staff attorney Alondra Johnson reviews Hector Menjivar&#8217;s time sheets.\u003c/p>\n\u003c/div>\n\u003cp>\u003cu>The immigrants hired\u003c/u> by Interstate’s subcontractor, Don’s Cen-Tex Restoration, to repair the flooded Ravinia Apartments included men and women of all ages who had to provide their own safety equipment. Lopez came to the U.S. five years ago in a wave of unaccompanied minors fleeing violence. Her former co-worker Hector Menjivar, 51, is also from Honduras but arrived in the U.S. 18 years ago.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“They told us they were going to pay us on Wednesday. Wednesday would come, and then they would tell us next Monday. Monday would come, then they would tell us next Wednesday,” recalled Menjivar.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>After three weeks on the job without a paycheck, he asked the man who hired him about the $1,500 he was owed. “I told him I liked the job, but I needed to get paid,” Menjivar said. “His response was that we should keep working, and that the salary would come for sure. That’s when we decided to stop working.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When Lopez initially sought advice from a lawyer about her unpaid wages, he told her there was “nothing he could do” because she was undocumented, despite the fact that immigrant workers are protected from wage theft by \u003ca href=\"https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs48spanish.htm\">federal\u003c/a> and state laws. But she got a different response when she joined Menjivar at a wage theft clinic offered by the \u003ca href=\"http://www.workersdefense.org/\">Workers Defense Project\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“They had the forethought to take pictures of their time sheets from the company for their hours, so it was easy to piece together the paperwork,” said Alondra Johnson, a WDP staff attorney who worked on the case. The time sheets said “Interstate” at the top.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The WDP decided the best strategy was to notify Interstate and the owner of the Ravinia Apartments in a certified letter that if the workers remained unpaid, the property and improvements “may be subjected to a lien pursuant to the State of Texas Property Code,” which could freeze financial transactions related to the project.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Just because they were hired by a subcontractor does not mean Interstate would not bear liability,” Shana Khader, director of WDP’s employment and legal services program, told The Intercept. “The lien is powerful because it goes straight to the top of the chain,” allowing workers to resolve their claims more quickly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In January, the group presented the workers with their paychecks from the subcontractor during a Facebook Live \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WorkersDefenseProject/videos/1745048632181523/\">video\u003c/a>. Once they were paid, the workers signed lien releases.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Don Gross, the owner of Don’s Cen-Tex Restoration, said in a phone interview that the lien “alerted me to the money that was owed the workers” and that he paid them “as soon as we found out about the problem.” He complained that Interstate had been late in responding to his biweekly invoice in the chaos after the storm, and then some of the funds were stolen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Interstate’s vice president of operations, Brian Wooley, told The Intercept in a statement that the firm was “aware of incidences during chaotic events when the workers hired by our subcontractors felt they were not receiving payment in a timely manner.” He added that “Interstate always pays its own workers and vendors on time” and expects its subcontractors to do the same.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But Gross said he has subcontracted with the company in the aftermath of other natural disasters, and “our checks have been more on time, not to the point now that you have to fight for every check and when they will pay me.” He added, “I’ve been doing this since Hurricane Katrina and I’ve never seen it this bad in my career.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'>\u003cbr />\n\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/Houston-Hector-1520532948.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-175158\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/Houston-Hector-1520532948-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Hector Menjivar outside of the car dealership he works at in Houston, Texas on Feb. 27, 2018.\" />\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption overlayed\">Hector Menjivar outside of the car dealership where he now works in Houston, Texas, on Feb. 27, 2018.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class='caption source pullright' style=''>Photo: Jessica Ofelia Alvarenga for The Intercept\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\n\u003cp>\u003cu>The victory for\u003c/u> Lopez and Menjivar marked the first time that the Workers Defense Project has used a lien to hold a disaster recovery firm accountable for failing to pay workers in Houston on time, or at all.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The group’s Houston organizer, Mauricio “Chele” Iglesias, said he hopes workers who have encountered wage theft around the city will be encouraged “to step forward and decide to take action.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“When we think about strategies for recovering unpaid wages and making police reports, we do have a lot of members who are immigrants who are wary of doing that,” Johnson said. “So a lien seems more confidential and less risky.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Filing a lien can be much cheaper than litigation, and the response is usually much faster than it would be to a complaint filed under the Texas Payday Law, which few workers have heard of, or the \u003ca href=\"https://www.osha.gov/workers/file_complaint.html\">Fair Labor Standards Act\u003c/a> of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which has limited staff in Texas.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>WDP lawyers have also learned from partners in New York and New Orleans who recovered unpaid wages for people working on rebuilding after hurricanes Sandy and Katrina. Since 2011, the New York Department of Labor has returned more than \u003ca href=\"https://www.labor.ny.gov/pressreleases/2017/december-04-2017.shtm\">$150 million\u003c/a> to mostly to immigrant construction workers through “compliance conferences,” in which employers agree to pay what they owe. When they refuse, local district attorneys can prosecute.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In contrast, Louisiana lacks a state labor agency, so most of the litigation is handled by volunteers with the Workplace Justice Project at Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, which has filed \u003ca href=\"http://www.takepart.com/feature/2015/08/17/new-orleans-wage-theft-katrina-reconstrutction\">claims\u003c/a> totaling between $200,000 and $300,000 every year since Katrina.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“The biggest strategy we have created is to file suit,” Luz Molina, director of the project, told The Intercept. This keeps track of alleged offenders, “whether we are successful or not, so there will be a public record of this individual cheating somebody of their wages.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>She noted that day laborers pose special challenges as clients because they often change addresses and phone numbers, or disappear for other reasons. “I just finished settling a case of a client,” Molina recalled, “and when I called him, I found out he’d been picked up and deported.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Back in Texas, the WDP has asked state lawmakers to vote on a measure next year to create a public list of companies that owe back wages to their employees. “Workers told us, ‘If this info was available, we would know who to avoid,’” Khader said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Companies that rob workers of their wages can also face criminal “theft of service” charges under the Texas penal code, which defines “service” to include “labor.” The Austin Police Department and the Travis County Attorney have pursued such cases since 2002, and former APD Cmdr. Juan Gonzalez \u003ca href=\"https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2002-12-27/115732/\">said\u003c/a> he thought the threat “made some employers pay up.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Advocates hope more law enforcement officials will pursue similar cases. The WPD says officers should have a clear policy in place that they will to refuse to share a worker’s legal status with immigration agents despite the Texas law known as \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/08/03/texas-police-say-sb4-is-damaging-public-safety-before-even-taking-effect/\">SB4\u003c/a>, which instructs them to do so for anyone they detain or arrest. They point to how some contractors in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina avoided paying migrant workers by \u003ca href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2007/07/post-katrina-aftermath-absence-oversight-reconstruction-workers-became-another-casu/\">reporting them\u003c/a> to federal authorities after they had done weeks of work.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Neither Lopez nor Menjivar contacted the police when Interstate failed to pay them. Menjivar said that at first, he was concerned he would be asked about his legal status if the WDP filed a lien on his behalf. But once he established trust with labor advocates, he “didn’t feel afraid anymore.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“What can I say?” he concluded. “It was a lot of money that I worked hard for. So I decided to do it.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">Top photo: Hector Menjivar outside of the car dealership where he works in Houston, Texas, on Feb. 27,

In October, Twitter&#8217;s general counsel \u003ca href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/10-31-17%20Edgett%20Testimony.pdf\">told\u003c/a> a Senate committee investigating disinformation that Russian bots tweeted 1.4 million times during the run-up to the last presidential election, and such bots would later be \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/technology/russian-bots-school-shooting.html\">implicated\u003c/a> in hundreds of tweets that followed a school shooting in Florida. In January, the New York Times \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/27/technology/social-media-bots.html\">detailed\u003c/a> how U.S. companies, executives, journalists, and celebrities often purchase bots as followers in an attempt to make themselves seem more popular.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The fallout for the company has been withering. In Vanity Fair last month, writer Nick Bilton, who has tracked the company closely as an author and journalist, \u003ca href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/02/nick-bilton-reveals-the-truth-about-twitters-dirty-secret\">accused\u003c/a> Twitter of “turning a blind eye to the problem” of bots for years in order to artificially inflate its count of active users. Meanwhile, disgruntled former Twitter executives told Maya Kosoff, also in Vanity Fair, that the social network was throwing too many humans and too little technology at the problem of bots and other misbehavior. “You had this unsophisticated human army with no real scalable platform to plug into,” one said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Even if Twitter hasn’t invested much in anti-bot software, some of its most technically proficient users have. They’re writing and refining code that can use Twitter’s public application programming interface, or API, as well as Google and other online interfaces, to ferret out fake accounts and bad actors. The effort, at least among the researchers I spoke with, has begun with hunting bots designed to promote pornographic material — a type of fake account that is particularly easy to spot — but the plan is to eventually broaden the hunt to other types of bots. The bot-hunting programming and research has been a strictly volunteer, part-time endeavor, but the efforts have collectively identified tens of thousands of fake accounts, underlining just how much low-hanging fruit remains for Twitter to prune.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Autodidacts at Automaton Detection\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>Among the part-time bot-hunters is French security researcher and freelance Android developer \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/fs0c131y/status/963069326566854657\">Baptiste Robert, who in February of this year noticed\u003c/a> that Twitter accounts with profile photos of scantily clad women were liking his tweets or following him on Twitter. Aside from the sexually suggestive images, the bots had similarities. Not only did these Twitter accounts typically include profile photos of adult actresses, but they also had similar bios, followed similar accounts, liked more tweets than they retweeted, had fewer than 1,000 followers, and directed readers to click the link in their bios.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One of the \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/jennlilly2013\">first accounts Robert looked at\u003c/a>, which is now suspended, linked to the site datewith-me1.com, which was registered with a Russian email address also connected to instaflirtbook.com, hookupviplocators1.com, yoursexydream11.com, and sex4choice.com. Robert said it looked like various phishing sites had an identical schema and were likely operated by the same person.\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-left' data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='left'>&#8220;The idea was to show how easy it was to find these bots by just using Google search.&#8221;\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>So, Robert decided to create a proof-of-concept bot to show his followers that finding these accounts is pretty easy. After determining a set of similarities between the bots, he used \u003ca href=\"https://www.hackingloops.com/google-dorks/\">advanced Google queries\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://images.google.com/\">Google reverse image search\u003c/a> to find more of them. He then wrote a few hundred lines of code in the programming language Python to create a bot to hunt down and expose fake accounts. “It took less than one hour to write the first version of \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/PornBotHunter\">@PornBotHunter\u003c/a>,” Robert said. “The first idea was to show how easy it was to find these bots by just using Google search.” The bot hunter tweets information on porn bots it has detected every hour, including Twitter handles, profile pictures, number of followers, longevity of the profile, biographical links, and whether Twitter has suspended the account. It also posts lengthier reports about its activities to Pastebin, a text hosting site popular among security researchers. Robert also allows people to report false positives to his regular Twitter account.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Robert is quick to admit that the software is just a proof of concept. He is planning on rewriting it to catch other types of bots as well, ranging from cryptocurrency bots to political bots. He also hopes to create a framework that’ll help people see how many bots are following them on Twitter. Once the project is stable and reviewed, he plans to open source the source code.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Still, it’s fascinating that a tool put together in just an hour is catching bots before Twitter does itself. As of March 1, @PornBotHunter has listed 197 spammy, apparently fake accounts in Pastebin, and 66, roughly a third, have yet to be suspended by Twitter. The others were suspended soon after being indexed by Google or after Robert reported them to Twitter. (A handful of the remaining active accounts, which may have only been compromised temporarily, do not appear to be spam accounts run by bots.)\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class=\"photo-grid\" data-caption=\"Top/Left: A visualization of websites linked by tweets from bots analyzed by Swedish research team Botjakten.

They decided to analyze some of these porn bots through a project called \u003ca href=\"http://www.botjakten.se/\">Botjakten\u003c/a> (&#8220;jakten&#8221; means “hunt” in Norwegian). All of Botjakten’s code is \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Segerberg/botjakten\">up on GitHub\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Botjakten started in mid-January as a crowdsourced project using a simple Google form that allowed users to report suspected bots that had followed or retweeted them. That, along with individuals who reached out to share their blacklists, gave them about 5,000 bots. Although some people provided false information on the form, it gave them a great starting point to look for patterns in location, profile photos, account creation date, numbers of retweets, outbound links, and more. They then wrote software to identify still more bots, querying Twitter’s livestream API with different terms, including sexually explicit phrases and hashtags associated with bots, and visualize the bots’ activity, for example by showing the webpages they linked. (The visualization code was written in the JavaScript programming language, and the bot detection code in Python.)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>After a few weeks, the 30,000 bots identified by the Botjakten group’s software suddenly ceased all activity, so they attempted to find more bots by examining accounts that followed those 30,000 bots. This produced 20,000 more bots to track. “It seemed likely that they would follow one another, and we were right about that assumption,” said Andreas Segerberg, who works at the Gothenburg City Archives and teaches digital preservation/archival theory at the University of Gothenburg when not working on the project. Twitter’s API limits the number of requests per minute, so the process was very slow and took about a month.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Botjakten is working on analyzing the data, for example, mapping the online behavior of these porn bots, trying to understand from where they originate, and gathering data on how widespread the issue is. The team hopes to analyze the percentage of bots that have been suspended and the percentage of accounts that were compromised, but have since returned to their rightful owners.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But even though the team put the collection part of the project on pause to focus on analysis, they have seen a second wave of bots that they plan to monitor. Botjakten plans to keep monitoring the bots and eventually publish its findings, then report the bots en masse to Twitter, Segerberg said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Then, like Robert, they want to look at other data as well. “There’s an election coming up in Sweden in October; that will be something we will keep a close eye on,” said Segerberg.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class=\"photo-grid\" data-caption=\"Two sites tweeted by bots examined by Botjakten.\" data-columns=\"2\" data-credit=\"Image: Botjakten\" data-photos=\"%5B%7B%22alt%22%3A%22%22%2C%22src%22%3A%22https%3A%5C%2F%5C%2Ftheintercept.com%5C%2Fwp-uploads%5C%2Fsites%5C%2F1%5C%2F2018%5C%2F03%5C%2FScreenshot_2018-01-19_08-57-00-1520888108-841x1024.png%22%7D%2C%7B%22alt%22%3A%22%22%2C%22src%22%3A%22https%3A%5C%2F%5C%2Ftheintercept.com%5C%2Fwp-uploads%5C%2Fsites%5C%2F1%5C%2F2018%5C%2F03%5C%2FScreenshot_2018-01-19_08-58-04-1520888120-841x1024.png%22%7D%5D\" data-size=\"xtra-large\">\u003c/div>\n\u003cp>They’re still not done analyzing their data, but the Botjakten project has already identified similarities in porn bot accounts: images of a small number of adult film actresses, bots that share specific syntax when posting links that point to two websites with sexual content, the use of obscure link shorteners with URLs linking to questionnaire sites that then direct users to one of two dating websites. Aside from the redirects bouncing visitors from one place to another, some sites linked by the porn bots run cryptocurrency miners in users’ browsers, hijacking their computers’ processors to make money for scammers. Some accounts appear to be autogenerated for the sole purpose of spamming users as part of a bot network, while others appear to be hacked accounts from real users. (This can happen when people use bad passwords or reuse usernames and passwords on multiple accounts, since hackers can test those combinations out on multiple accounts after just one is compromised.)\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Twitter Is &#8220;More Proactive Than They&#8217;ve Ever Been&#8221;\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>Although bots have clearly become a more prominent issue for Twitter over the past year and a half, freelance bot hunting has something of a history. Security analyst Rob Cook began hunting porn bots in 2016 and \u003ca href=\"https://www.scmagazine.com/new-crop-of-twitter-pornbots-found-advertising-adult-sites-misappropriating-hashtags/article/743825/\">recently found\u003c/a> about a fifth of the ones he discovered back then are still active. Also in 2016, security firm Symantec \u003ca href=\"https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/hacked-twitter-accounts-are-posting-links-adult-dating-and-sex-personals\">discovered that 2,500 popular Twitter accounts were hijacked by porn bots\u003c/a> within a two-week span; profile photos were replaced with sexually suggestive images, display names and bios were changed, and tweets included links to sketchy adult dating sites. \u003ca href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03107.pdf\">Research released in March 2017\u003c/a> estimated that a whopping 9 to 15 percent of active Twitter accounts were bots. Information security journalist Joseph Cox \u003ca href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ezpa8w/follow-a-trail-of-twitter-porn-bots-and-this-is-where-theyll-take-you\">followed a trail of Twitter porn bots\u003c/a> for Vice’s Motherboard a few months after that and found “a network of over a dozen interlinked dodgy-looking dating websites.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The ubiquity of these accounts and relative ease with which users and researchers alike can find them begs the question of why Twitter seems to be two steps behind. When reached for comment, a Twitter spokesperson said, “Our team uses a combination of technology and human review to identify and remove content that is spammy and attempts to manipulate the service. This is important, ongoing work that we will continue to prioritize.” The spokesperson further provided The Intercept with information on \u003ca href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules\">Twitter’s rules on spam\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-right' data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='right'>&#8220;Given the scale we’re working at and erring on the side of protecting peoples’ voices &#8230; context is crucial when we review content.&#8221;\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>When asked why so many accounts continue to proliferate in spite of these efforts — why hackers can build tools to detect active accounts that Twitter hasn’t caught — the spokesperson stated, “There are hundreds of millions of Tweets sent every day, and we use both reports and our technology to help enforce the Twitter Rules. Given the scale we’re working at and erring on the side of protecting peoples&#8217; voices, including types of activity that on the outside can appear spammy, context is crucial when we review content. We employ a variety of techniques to combat spam, depending on the type of behavior we observe on the account; this approach helps us make the most informed, thoughtful decisions. For example, we may be able to help an original account owner regain control of a hacked account, rather than deleting it entirely. Every day we observe new ways people attempt to spam or manipulate content on the service, and our team works hard to ensure we’re enforcing our rules fairly and consistently.” While Twitter insists that it proactively monitors for spammy or manipulative behavior and removes accounts in violation of its spam rules, it would not comment on individual accounts for privacy and security reasons.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the summer of 2017, Twitter did take down SIREN, a \u003ca href=\"https://www.zerofox.com/blog/inside-massive-siren-social-network-spam-botnet/\">massive spam pornography botnet\u003c/a> of \u003ca href=\"https://gizmodo.com/nearly-90-000-sex-bots-invaded-twitter-in-one-of-the-la-1796985630\">over 90,000 accounts\u003c/a> that included profiles with women’s names and sexually suggestive photographs with canned sexually explicit phrases in broken English. After Baltimore-based security firm ZeroFOX disclosed the profiles and posts to the Twitter security team, they were removed — but this was after the botnet generated almost 30 million clicks through Twitter, as well as \u003ca href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/06/inside-a-porn-pimping-spam-botnet/\">spam emails\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class=\"photo-grid\" data-caption=\"A visualization of websites linked from the Twitter profiles of porn bots identified by the Swedish research project Botjakten.\" data-columns=\"2\" data-credit=\"Image: Botjakten\" data-photos=\"%5B%7B%22alt%22%3A%22%22%2C%22src%22%3A%22https%3A%5C%2F%5C%2Ftheintercept.com%5C%2Fwp-uploads%5C%2Fsites%5C%2F1%5C%2F2018%5C%2F03%5C%2Fbotjakten_sankey_37K_se_sv-1520888313-1000x750.png%22%7D%2C%7B%22alt%22%3A%22%22%2C%22src%22%3A%22https%3A%5C%2F%5C%2Ftheintercept.com%5C%2Fwp-uploads%5C%2Fsites%5C%2F1%5C%2F2018%5C%2F03%5C%2Fbotjakten_sankey_37K_us_en-1520888317-1000x750.png%22%7D%5D\" data-size=\"xtra-large\">\u003c/div>\n\u003cp>Erin Gallagher, a multimedia artist, writer, and translator, said Twitter has improved in the past couple years. Gallagher would know because she researches Twitter bot networks and diagrams them, showing clusters of retweet networks, hub accounts, and other information, using the visualization software tool Gephi. “In their \u003ca href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/2016-election-update.html\">most recent report\u003c/a>, [Twitter] said that in December of 2017, their automatic systems identified more than 6.4 million suspicious accounts per week, which seems bananas, and actually they’ve increased their detection system 60 percent since October,” she told me. “It seems that they’re more proactive than they have ever been.” Further, Gallagher explained that Twitter takes more heat than other social media platforms because it has an open API, which allows independent researchers to access the data and study it. And there’s the possibility that while these porn bots have found a way around Twitter’s detection mechanisms, they wouldn’t have taken steps to circumvent detection from smaller projects of which they’re unaware.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But Segerberg, of the Botjakten project, points out that it’s much easier to create a bot on Twitter than it is to report one. “In essence, there are no captchas or anything when signing up for an account, but it takes, like, five steps to report a spam account.” To do so, Twitter requires users to click on that account’s profile, click the overflow icon, select “report” from the menu, select “they are posting spam” from the drop-down menu, and follow recommendations for additional actions to take. Reporting tweets is equally cumbersome: One must navigate to the appropriate tweet, tap the icon, select “report tweet,” select “it’s spam,” and then follow the recommendations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Perhaps creating a more user-friendly reporting process and tapping into some of the data from independent projects such as @PornBotHunter and Botjakten could help Twitter improve their processes and find some of the bots they have missed.\u003c/p>\n","credit_additional_reporting":"","credit_additional_reporting_users_object":"","credit_photo_illustration":"","credit_research":"","credit_research_users_object":"","credit_translation":"","credit_translation_users_object":"","date":"2018-03-16T14:29:13+00:00","date_local":"2018-03-16T10:29:13+00:00","documents":"","excerpt":"As

A guard walks from person to person, executing them with a gunshot to the head. Suddenly, a Soviet soldier runs up to the executioner and tells him that the killings have suddenly been called off &#8212; orders straight from the top.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The prisoner who was next in line to die looks to his left, pondering the bodies he&#8217;s been spared from joining by inexplicable good luck. It&#8217;s both horrifying and comical, and reveals the utterly arbitrary way in which the Soviet Union moved people into and out of an out-group worthy of murdering.\u003c/p>\n\u003ciframe width='100%' height='400px' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/ukJ5dMYx2no' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen>\u003c/iframe>\n\u003cp>Like &#8220;Veep&#8221; and &#8220;The Thick of It&#8221; &#8212;  Iannucci TV productions that satirize the banal but pathological problems of American and British political hacks &#8212; &#8220;The Death of Stalin&#8221; isn&#8217;t so much about specific officials. No one was cast because they look like the real human beings they play. And the humor is largely geared towards British and American audiences &#8212; for instance, a sequence where the de facto leaders of the Soviet Union all joust to be the first car out of a driveway is just pure Anglo-American sketch comedy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Rather, the movie&#8217;s about the overall Soviet system in particular, and human beings in general. As we watch the bumbling Soviet Presidium scramble to take control of the Soviet Union following Stalin&#8217;s collapse, what stands out above all else is that the supposed elites in charge of this sprawling prison-state-with-nuclear-weapons are actually not very different from anyone else.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>They gossip and backbite. They get into petty disputes. They even \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC7iAsbBxMY\">argue over\u003c/a> who gets invited to state funerals. But because they are high-ranking government elites, their idiosyncrasies have lethal consequences. Whether you&#8217;re on the good side or the bad side of a government bureaucrat on any particular day can mean the difference between a promotion and a summary execution, between owning a princely estate or spending the rest of your life in the gulags.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This raises the central question of the movie: Given the foibles and gross flaws of every human being, can it ever be a good idea to centralize so much power in the hands of so few people?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In a post-Soviet world this question may seem less relevant. But remember that four times as many people are governed by the rising Chinese government than live in the United States. And out of all the countries of the world, China may be behind only North Korea in embodying Stalin&#8217;s vision of an all-powerful state governed by an all-powerful few.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Yes, to some \u003ca href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/thomas-friedmans-love-affair-with-china-cont./article/242382\">outside observers\u003c/a> China&#8217;s rapid economic growth and increasingly impressive infrastructure makes the country a success story. And few can dispute the fact that the country has, more than any other modern state, \u003ca href=\"http://povertydata.worldbank.org/poverty/country/CHN\">rapidly reduced\u003c/a> the presence of extreme poverty over the past three decades.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But as &#8220;Death of Stalin&#8221; and all of Iannucci&#8217;s works illustrate, when you centralize power into the hands of any particular individuals, whether it be in the old USSR or 21st century China, the anxieties of those officials become state policy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Just ask Winnie the Pooh.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>After Chinese social media users used an image of Xi Jingping to liken him to the lovable cartoon bear, China&#8217;s powerful censorship officials sprung into action.

Phrases such as &#8220;I don&#8217;t agree&#8221; were \u003ca href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-43198404\">quickly de-activated\u003c/a> on the popular social media website Weibo. (Most American social media websites are banned from China, and Weibo serves as a Twitter-like service &#8212; but with 340 million users, even more than Twitter.)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But you don&#8217;t have to live in an actual dictatorship like China to appreciate the lessons of &#8220;The Death of Stalin.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the movie&#8217;s first scene, we see a premiere Moscow orchestra perform for a live radio broadcast. As it&#8217;s ending, an official receives a request from Stalin for a recording. But no recording had been made. The conductor melts down in terror, trips and knocks himself out. The entire production is hastily reassembled, with a new conductor dragged out of his home in his pajamas. He can hardly refuse &#8212; his life and the lives of others are literally on the line.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Most Americans, of course, won&#8217;t find themselves in a life-or-death situation based on something so trivial. But we live in a society with a unionization rate around ten percent, and most workers have next to no due process for employment at their jobs. People are regularly fired for social media postings, and unlike in the \u003ca href=\"http://mattbruenig.com/2017/08/22/you-prevent-private-coercion-with-labor-market-regulation/\">European Union\u003c/a>, you have virtually no right to be protected from termination simply because you hold a political view with which your employer disagrees. In \u003ca href=\"https://www.alternet.org/economy/its-all-too-easy-get-fired-america-49-50-states-you-can-be-fired-any-reason\">most states\u003c/a> you can legally be fired if your boss doesn&#8217;t like the color of your t-shirt.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Thus for many, many Americans, the workplace is close to an absolute dictatorship, with essentially no democratic representation in the face of their boss. The problem, however, is not your individual boss, but rather a system that gives them all the power over you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>American satire is, to say the least, less than helpful in comprehending this. It generally embraces America&#8217;s individualistic ideals about how power works, misdiagnosing political problems as the result of One Very Bad Person &#8212; rather than the result of corrosive powerful interests, retrograde systems of governance, and widely-held social mythologies. For instance, Warner Brothers released the hit movie &#8220;Horrible Bosses,&#8221; but it&#8217;s unlikely they&#8217;ll ever put out a film called &#8220;Bosses Are Horrible.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&#8220;Saturday Night Live&#8221; is particularly misleading. The long-running weekend sketch show is known for its satirical portrayals of political figures &#8212; ranging from Tina Fey&#8217;s Sarah Palin to Alec Baldwin&#8217;s Donald Trump.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>These performances make us laugh &#8212; Sarah Palin thinks she&#8217;s a Russia expert because she can see it from her house! &#8212; and to the credit of the actors doing them, they&#8217;re often spot-on exaggerations of quite real personality quirks and flaws of our leading government officials.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The problem is that these portrayals don&#8217;t strike at the root of the dysfunctions in American political life. When it comes down to the actual policies the government is pursuing and the biggest social problems the U.S. faces, you can&#8217;t pin all the blame on mere personalities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the case of Palin, liberals \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/katie-couric-still-cant-believe-how-badly-sarah-palin-bombed/article/2592052\">will always remember her\u003c/a> for her less-than-erudite answers to Katie Couric&#8217;s basic questions &#8212; but conservatives view many of the same answers as part of her folksy charm and appeal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Thus making political satire a referendum on personalities is naturally polarizing and fundamentally unserious. It&#8217;s hardly a surprise, then, that not long after Tina Fey&#8217;s Palin debuted on SNL, the \u003ca href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/TV/10/18/palin.snl/index.html\">candidate herself appeared\u003c/a> to join in on the fun.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But what if instead of skewering Palin the person, SNL had skewered the underlying beliefs and systems that almost any GOP vice presidential candidate would have adopted? &#8220;Drill Baby Drill,&#8221; the famous mantra she repeated at campaign stops across America in 2008, was to many the perfect bumper sticker encapsulation of their worldview: that oil drilling produces jobs, and jobs are what America needs. That gets us to the underlying ideology behind Palin&#8217;s iconic catchphrase: the all-consuming American fixation on fossil fuels as a driver of the economy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Attacking that ideology would have been far more subversive than making fun of how Palin talks. SNL could have instead targeted the propaganda put forth by the nation&#8217;s big polluters. And they could have accurately made the mockery bipartisan &#8212; recall Barack Obama&#8217;s embrace of the laughable phrase &#8220;\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GehK7Q_QxPc\">clean coal\u003c/a>,&#8221; something that \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GehK7Q_QxPc\">even made its way\u003c/a> into industry propaganda.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This is even clearer with the current occupant of the White House. Endless fixation on President Trump&#8217;s ego or his addiction to Twitter are achieving about as much as SNL&#8217;s Palin bits: These aspects of Donald Trump&#8217;s personality are already self-evidently a turn-off or wildly entertaining, depending on how you feel about the 45th President. The same goes for The Daily Show: When it makes fun of something Trump said at a campaign rally, you&#8217;ve probably already heard it already, and have decided how you feel about it before the segment even airs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Intercept&#8217;s Lee Fang highlighted this phenomenon in a recent tweet:\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\">\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump era political social media feels a lot like Bush era Daily Show.

The show, \u003ca href=\"https://blog.simonsays.ai/satire-paradox-with-malcolm-gladwell-s2-e10-revisionist-history-podcast-transcript-37119b0bf8ae\">highlighted\u003c/a> in Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s podcast last year, is resolutely opposed to the fifty-year long occupation of the Palestinian people. But to make the case against the occupation, the show doesn&#8217;t focus just on gaffes by individual politicians, or skewering the mannerisms of the Israeli right. Instead, it forces the viewers to think about the foundational myths that sustain the entire system of military occupation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In a segment that aired in 2011, a group of Israeli kindergarten children are prompted by their teacher to talk about the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. One after one, the children repeat government mantras about why the bloody status quo must stay in place. &#8220;The IDF is a moral army!&#8221; says one little girl. &#8220;Our problem is PR,&#8221; a cute little boy offers. &#8220;It&#8217;s proven, removing settlements doesn&#8217;t bring peace,&#8221; another girl proclaims. The teacher asks, &#8220;What do we call the rest of the world?&#8221; The children respond in unison, &#8220;Anti-semitic!&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003ciframe width='100%' height='400px' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/M9Sdkps0Quo' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen>\u003c/iframe>\n\u003cp>The picture isn&#8217;t entirely bleak for American satirists, however.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Earlier this month, comic genius Jordan Peele won a well-deserved Oscar for his screenplay for the dark comedy &#8220;Get Out.&#8221; Peele&#8217;s approach cuts deeply because he generally shies away from directly satirizing politics, instead emphasizing root structures and ideologies.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Moreover, &#8220;Get Out&#8221; doesn&#8217;t pick on some stereotype of a Southern racist &#8212; as is common throughout American liberal satire &#8212; but rather targets a certain kind of liberal ideology that fetishizes African American culture.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At one point in the film, an upper middle class Caucasian white collar professional proclaims that he wishes he could have voted for Barack Obama a third time to impress his white daughter&#8217;s black boyfriend. The line not only produces a lot of laughs, but uncovers a bigger truth about how liberalism in 21st century America often revolves around embracing certain forms of cultural chauvinism to project virtue.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It just so happens that the very same people who do this in &#8220;Get Out&#8221; are also running a form of modern slavery that involves literally inserting your brain into psychologically ensnared African American bodies. Of course, liberals who go to pains to embrace &#8220;ethnic&#8221; culture don&#8217;t literally do this. But if you extend their logic far enough, you might just get there!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A viral tweet from Brookings scholar Shadi Hamid on Oscar night summarized this sort of thinking:\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\">\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The people who think Get Out should get Best Picture are the people who kill you in Get Out\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&mdash; Shadi Hamid (@shadihamid) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/shadihamid/status/970458110304423937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 5, 2018\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>\u003cscript async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\">\u003c/script>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Peele&#8217;s approach is the same in his earlier work. Take the sketch below from Key &amp; Peele, his Comedy Central show with collaborator Keegan-Michael Key:\u003c/p>\n\u003ciframe width='100%' height='400px' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/rtgY1q0J_TQ' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen>\u003c/iframe>\n\u003cp>In this 2014 sketch, a gay man (played by Key) is invited to explain gay marriage to a large African-American family assembled in a living room. It&#8217;s obvious from the get-go that the family is uncomfortable with the situation (recall that \u003ca href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2017/06/26/support-for-same-sex-marriage-grows-even-among-groups-that-had-been-skeptical/\">opposition to same-sex marriage has historically been more common\u003c/a> among African-Americans than whites or Hispanics).\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But rather than simply skewering them as homophobes and berating them for their lack of political correctness, Key &amp; Peele lean into that skepticism. Key&#8217;s character fields all manner of comical questions from the family.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&#8220;So then, do the men wear dresses and the women would wear suits?&#8221; asks one relative. &#8220;Now, none of us are gay so I assume that we would all sit in the straight section,&#8221; another conjectures. &#8220;When in the ceremony do we sing &#8216;Over The Rainbow&#8217;?&#8221; asks a third.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Throughout all this questioning, Key&#8217;s character keeps his cool and calmly reminds his family over and over that a gay wedding is actually pretty much just like a straight wedding. It&#8217;s an empathetic way to address the underlying doubts the community has about gay marriage without making anyone individually feel like they are under attack or the root of the problem.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The critical success of &#8220;Get Out&#8221; &#8212; as well as &#8220;\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/11/26/three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri/\">Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\u003c/a>,&#8221; which satirizes police violence and the desire for revenge &#8212; shows that there is a real desire among Americans for smart satire that takes aim at social systems and attitudes rather than mockery of individuals.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And Americans are in luck, because after the success of &#8220;Get Out,&#8221; Peele \u003ca href=\"https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/02/jordan-peele-is-directing-another-genre-thriller-f.html\">has announced\u003c/a> he will be directing another socially aware thriller.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“You know, I think it’s important to focus on stories that are true to me,” he said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “My next film, I am currently writing it and I’ll direct for Universal this year; I’m just trying to entertain myself again. One thing I know is that this is genre; and playing around with the thriller, horror, action, fun, genre of intrigue is my favorite. That’s my sweet spot. So I think tonally it should resemble &#8220;Get Out.&#8221; That said, I want to make a completely different movie. I want to address something different than race in the next one.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This all matters because satire, in the right hands, can be a powerful tool to change people&#8217;s minds. I know this for sure: Last year, after watching Korean director \u003cspan class=\"st\">Bong Joon-ho\u003c/span>&#8216;s &#8220;Okja&#8221; &#8212; a Netflix-released satire aimed at a Monsanto-style corporation that raises genetically engineered pigs &#8212; I gave up eating almost every type of meat.\u003c/p>\n\u003ciframe width='100%' height='400px' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/AjCebKn4iic' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen>\u003c/iframe>\n\u003cp>The film focused not on demonizing meat eaters or attacking some real life personality, but rather the wider cruelty of factory farms and genetic engineering. By the end of the film, you realize that the problem isn&#8217;t so much that meat eaters lack good morals as individuals, but that as a society we haven&#8217;t faced up to the level of pain being inflicted on the animals we raised to be slaughtered.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I don&#8217;t believe a Daily Show segment or a viral tweet making fun of my former cheeseburger habits would have accomplished the same thing &#8212; just as I don&#8217;t think a movie focused on the specific flaws of Nikita Khrushchev would educate people about the true roots of totalitarianism. But great political comedy, definitely including &#8220;The Death of Stalin,&#8221; does show us where our problems lie: Not in the frailties of individuals, but the dangerous interaction of our systems and universal human nature.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">Top photo: Photo from the movie &#8220;The Death of Stalin&#8221; directed by Armando

Haspel later participated in the destruction of the CIA’s videotapes of some of its torture sessions. There is \u003ca href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-husseini/what-both-sides-are-ignor_b_6315678.html\">informed speculation\u003c/a> that part of the CIA’s motivation for destroying these records may have been that they showed operatives employing torture to generate false “intelligence” used to justify the invasion of Iraq.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>John Kiriakou, a former CIA operative who helped capture many Al Qaeda prisoners, \u003ca href=\"https://www.democracynow.org/2018/3/14/she_tortured_just_for_the_sake\">recently said\u003c/a> that Haspel was known to some at the agency as “Bloody Gina” and that “Gina and people like Gina did it, I think, because they enjoyed doing it. They tortured just for the sake of torture, not for the sake of gathering information.” (In 2012, in a \u003ca href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/01/john-kiriakou-cia-leak-investigation/\">convoluted case\u003c/a>, Kiriakou \u003ca href=\"http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/22/14626249-ex-cia-agent-pleads-guilty-to-leaking-identity-of-covert-operative?lite&amp;ocid=msnhp\">pleaded guilty\u003c/a> to leaking the identity of a covert CIA officer to the press and spent a year in prison.)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Some of Haspel’s champions have used the exact language of the popular version of the Nuremberg defense, while others have paraphrased it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One who paraphrased it is Michael Hayden, former director of both the CIA and the National Security Agency. In a \u003ca href=\"http://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/378378-we-need-gina-haspel-at-the-cia\">Wednesday op-ed\u003c/a>, Hayden endorsed Haspel as head of the CIA, writing that “Haspel did nothing more and nothing less than what the nation and the agency asked her to do, and she did it well.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Hayden later said \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/GenMhayden/status/973994954522595329\">on Twitter\u003c/a> that Haspel’s actions were “consistent with U.S. law as interpreted by the department of justice.” This is true: In 2002, the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department declared in a series of \u003ca href=\"https://www.therenditionproject.org.uk/documents/torture-docs.html\">notorious memos\u003c/a> that it was legal for the U.S. to engage in “enhanced interrogation techniques” that were obviously torture. Of course, the actions of the Nuremberg defendants had also been “legal” under German law.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>John Brennan, who ran the CIA under President Barack Obama, made similar remarks on Tuesday when asked about Haspel. The Bush administration had decided that its torture program was legal, \u003ca href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/13/gina-haspel-trump-nominee-first-woman-leader-cia/419547002/\">said Brennan\u003c/a>, and Haspel “tried to carry out her duties at CIA to the best of her ability, even when the CIA was asked to do some very difficult things.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Texas Republican Rep. Will Hurd used the precise language of the Nuremberg defense during a Tuesday appearance on CNN when Wolf Blitzer asked him to respond to a statement from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.: “The Senate must do its job in scrutinizing the record and involvement of Gina Haspel in this disgraceful program.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Hurd, a member of the House Intelligence Committee and a former CIA operative as well, told Blitzer that “this wasn’t Gina’s idea. She was following orders. … She implemented orders and was doing her job.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Hurd also told Blitzer, “You have to remember where we were at that moment, thinking that another attack was going to happen.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This is another defense that is explicitly illegitimate under international law. The U.N. Convention Against Torture, which was \u003ca href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=35858\">transmitted\u003c/a> to the Senate by Ronald Reagan in 1988, \u003ca href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CAT.aspx\">states\u003c/a> that “no exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat or war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Notably, Blitzer did not have any follow-up questions for Hurd about his jarring comments.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class=\"fve-video-wrapper fve-image-embed fve-thumbnail-image vimeo\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.873015873016%;\">\n    \u003ciframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/260162730?portrait=0&#038;byline=0&#038;title=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen>\u003c/iframe>    \u003c/div>\n\u003cp>Samantha Winograd, who served on President Obama’s National Security Council and now is an analyst for CNN, likewise used Nuremberg defense language in an appearance on the network. Haspel, \u003ca href=\"http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1803/13/cnr.06.html\">she said\u003c/a>, “was implementing the lawful orders of the president. … You could argue she should have quit because the program was so abhorrent. But she was following orders.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Last but not least there’s Rich Lowry, editor of National Review, who issued a ringing defense of Haspel in Politico, \u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/03/14/gina-haspel-bork-rich-lowry-217639\">claiming\u003c/a> she was merely acting “in response to what she was told were lawful orders.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Remarkably, this perspective has even seeped into the viewpoint of regular journalists. At a recent press conference at which Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul criticized Haspel, a reporter \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1ZkKzVvDdEZKv\">asked him\u003c/a> to respond to “the counterargument” that “these policies were signed off by the Bush administration. … They were considered lawful at the time.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It fell to Paul to make the obvious observation that appears to have eluded almost everyone else in official Washington: “This has been historically a question we’ve asked in every war: Is there a point at which soldiers say ‘no’? … Horrendous things happened in World War II, and people said, well, the German soldiers were just obeying orders. … I think there’s a point at which, even suffering repercussions, that if someone asks you to torture someone that you should say no.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>(Thank you to \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/jeanbilly545/status/973979444930105344\">@jeanbilly545\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://scotthorton.org/\">Scott Horton\u003c/a> for telling me about Hurd and Paul’s remarks, respectively.)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">Top photo: Gina Haspel speaks at the 2017 William J.

But DeVos has never been known for having positive relations with teachers unions. For decades prior to her joining the Trump administration, she funded politicians dedicated to weakening organized labor and backed school choice advocacy groups that depicted teachers unions as selfish enemies of deserving children. \u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u003cbr />\n\u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u003cbr />\n\u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">On Friday, management officials at the Education Department informed their workers’ union, the American Federation of Government Employees Council 252, that they would no longer be bargaining with them. Instead, management issued a 40-page document the department is calling a “\u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.afge.org/globalassets/documents/generalreports/2018/collective-bargaining-agreement-02-08-2018.pdf\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">collective bargaining agreement\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">.” This unilateral agreement supposedly took effect on Monday. Education Department staffers have been represented by the AFGE since 1982. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">“AFGE did not agree to these unilateral terms,” said Claudette Young, AFGE Council 252 president, in a statement. “The agency has imposed an illegal document that we had absolutely no bargaining over. It&#8217;s a total attempt to strip employees of their collective bargaining rights and bust the union.

Federal laptops, printers, and cellphones assigned to union members must be returned by March 26. Union office space must be vacated by April 11, unless the AFGE wants to start paying fair-market rent for its use.\u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u003cbr />\n\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Staffers who serve as union officers are now also being told that they will no longer receive paid leave for time spent performing union representational duties. “That impacts not only our salaries but our retirements,” said Young. \u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u003cbr />\n\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-right' data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='right'>“You can’t even call it a ‘collective bargaining agreement’ because it wasn’t collective, it wasn’t bargained, and there was no agreement.”\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">In a statement released Wednesday, the AFGE said stripping officers of their paid time to focus on bargaining and union duties “is like asking the fire department to operate without fire trucks or a firehose.” \u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u003cbr />\n\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Education Department did not return The Intercept’s request for comment, but Liz Hill, a department spokesperson, \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-education/2018/03/14/students-walk-out-of-classrooms-nationwide-130953\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">told Politico\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> that the AFGE “spent more than a year dragging its feet on ground rules negotiations without reaching any agreement, and then failed to respond in timely manner to negotiate over the contract proposed by the Department.” \u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u003cbr />\n\u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u003cbr />\n\u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to Young, the union had been hashing out ground rules between October 2016 and December 2017. They had another meeting scheduled for this month. Their last contract was negotiated in 2013. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">“We did not have any sticking points, we were not at an impasse,” she told The Intercept. “We were negotiating ground rules and making progress at every negotiating session.

(A spokesperson for the labor board did not return a request for comment.)

For one thing, it’s not signed by anyone in the union. “In order for any contract to be legally binding, it must be illustrated by a signature,” said Sharon Harris, national executive vice president for Council 252. The document also uses the union’s logo on its front cover. “They didn’t get permission from AFGE to use that, and it gives a false perception that this was a joint agreement between management and the union,” Harris added. Moreover, the document includes a preamble which states:\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote>\u003cp>The following articles of this agreement constitute a total and complete agreement on the subjects addressed in the articles, by and between the U.S. Department of Education &#8230; and the American Federation of Government Employees &#8230;\u003c/p>\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>“Their preamble states they reached an agreement with our union, which they did not,” said Young.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1024px;'>\u003cbr />\n\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-15-at-10.55.29-AM-1521126304-1521127615.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-176414\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-15-at-10.55.29-AM-1521126304-1521127615-1024x953.jpg\" alt=\"Screen-Shot-2018-03-15-at-10.55.29-AM-1521126304-1521127615\" />\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">The cover page of the Collective Bargaining Agreement issued by the Education Department.\u003c/p>\n\u003c/div>\n\u003cp>DeVos has avoided the AFGE’s attempts to sit down in person, according to union leaders.

If the pattern holds, Democrats have a strong chance of picking up the nearly two-dozen seats they need to win the House &#8212; and the subpoena power that comes with it.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Down on Page 20 of the memo is a pair of ideas that could put Congress on a collision course with privacy advocates in Silicon Valley. “Apple: The Committee should seek records reflecting downloaded encrypted messaging apps for certain key individuals,” \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/final_-_minority_status_of_the_russia_investigation_with_appendices.pdf\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">the memo suggests.\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> “The Committee should likewise issue a subpoena to WhatsApp for messages exchanged between key witnesses of interest.”\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The committee said that it would also seek to find out “all messaging applications that Mr. [Jared] Kushner used during the campaign as well as the presidential transition, including but not limited to SMS, iMessage, Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, Signal, Slack, Instagram, and Snapchat.”\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The committee may also consider adding ProtonMail, the encrypted email service, to that list. One White House staffer, Ryan P. McAvoy, jotted his ProtonMail passwords and his address on a piece of White House stationery and left it at a bus stop near the White House. A source found it there and provided it to The Intercept, which confirmed its authenticity. (McAvoy did not respond to requests for comment.)\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 768px;'>\u003cbr />\n\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/image_Redacted-1521217106.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-176655\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/image_Redacted-1521217106-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\u003c/a>\u003cbr />\n\u003c/div>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Peter Mirijanian, a spokesperson for Kushner’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, told The Intercept that Kushner had nothing left to add. “In two different appearances before congressional committees, Mr. Kushner answered all relevant questions involving these matters,” he said.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Democrats’ memo comes after Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee announced Monday that they found no evidence that Trump’s campaign colluded with Russian President Vladimir Putin to win the 2016 election. Trump heralded the halting of the investigation as vindication, celebrating the news on Twitter. Still, Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Trump-Russia collusion appears to be accelerating, with Mueller subpoenaing Trump Organization records on Thursday.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">In their memo, the Democrats on the committee said the Republicans were “prematurely shutting down the Russia investigation,” and that the committee’s conclusions are “at odds with the consensus of the Intelligence Community.”\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u003cu>If investigators decide\u003c/u> to follow through on the suggestion for the records request, they would put both Apple and WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, in a difficult spot. In recent years, both Apple and WhatsApp have increasingly marketed themselves in terms of pro-user privacy, including their inability to divulge the contents of users’ conversations. But in Apple’s case, the memo floats the idea not of gaining access to anyone’s conversations, but of simply obtaining records of what chat apps were downloaded by “certain key individuals.” \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">An Apple spokesperson told The Intercept that the company declines to comment on specific law enforcement matters, and referred instead to the company’s published law enforcement guidelines. These guidelines make clear that Apple retains download and purchase records and will provide them under court order. The App Store is like any other store: If you’re using it, you’re probably leaving behind very detailed receipts.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Getting messages from WhatsApp is trickier. Apple and WhatsApp both make heavy use of data encryption; in the case of both Apple iMessage and WhatsApp chats, sent and received messages are protected by so-called end-to-end encryption, meaning text is protected against anyone outside of those communicating, making it theoretically indecipherable to eavesdropping. Apple and WhatsApp both claim that they themselves are unable to access or furnish the decryption keys necessary to read the messages, meaning that even if they were to turn over chat data straight from their servers, it would remain uselessly scrambled.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-right' data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='right'>The memo’s recommendation to subpoena WhatsApp for chat logs is probably fruitless.\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The memo’s recommendation to subpoena WhatsApp for chat logs is probably fruitless, barring some revelation about how the company processes and retains user data. WhatsApp promises users that the company “doesn&#8217;t store your messages on our servers once we deliver them, and end-to-end encryption means that WhatsApp and third parties can&#8217;t read them anyway.” The company’s law enforcement guidelines state that although WhatsApp complies with all legal orders, even undelivered messages “are deleted from our servers after 30 days” after being sent.

Iran? Or, assuming President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un don’t hit it off at their summit, North Korea? Maybe even \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/12/world/americas/trump-venezuela-military.html\">Venezuela\u003c/a> or Russia?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It’s easier to say what one of the major causes of the war will be: the failure by many Americans — notably politicians, journalists, think tankers, and other elites — to employ a specific mental power that we’re all capable of employing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That power is called cognitive empathy, and it’s not what you might think. It doesn’t involve feeling people’s pain or even caring about their welfare. Emotional empathy is the kind of empathy that accomplishes those things. Cognitive empathy — sometimes called perspective taking — is a matter of seeing someone’s point of view: understanding how they’re processing information, how the world looks to them. Sounds unexceptional, I know — like the kind of thing you do every day. But there are at least two reasons cognitive empathy deserves more attention than it gets.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>First, because the failure to exercise it lies behind two of the most dangerous kinds of misperceptions in international affairs: misreading a nation’s military moves as offensive when the nation itself considers them defensive, and viewing some national leaders as crazy or fanatical when in fact they’ll respond predictably to incentives if you understand their goals.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The second reason cognitive empathy deserves more attention is that, however simple it sounds, it can be hard to exercise. Somewhat like emotional empathy, cognitive empathy can shut down or open up depending on your relationship to the person in question — friend, rival, enemy, kin — and how you’re feeling about them at the moment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And, to make matters worse, there’s this: In Washington, lots of money is being spent to keep us from exercising cognitive empathy. Important institutions, most notably some we misleadingly call “think tanks,” work to warp our vision. And the reality-distortion fields they generate can get powerful when the war drums start beating.\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-right' data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='right'>You may have trouble understanding why Iran would fear an unprovoked attack.\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>Consider, as a case study, a recent \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/world/middleeast/iran-syria-israel.html\">piece\u003c/a> about Iran in the New York Times.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It was a front-page story — the lead article in the physical edition of the paper — written by Ben Hubbard, Isabel Kershner, and Anne Barnard. The headline, in the top-righthand corner of the front page, read, “Iran Building Up Militias in Syria to Menace Israel.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Just about any expert on Iran would agree that, strictly speaking, this headline is accurate. However, a number of experts would add something that these three reporters failed to add: From Iran’s point of view, the purpose of menacing Israel may be to prevent war; having the capacity to inflict unacceptable damage on Jerusalem and Tel Aviv can be a way of keeping both Israel and the U.S. from attacking Iran.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>You may have trouble understanding why Iran would fear an unprovoked attack. Most Americans don’t think of their country as wantonly aggressive and most Israelis don’t think of their country that way, either. But Israel has repeatedly threatened to attack Iran — and eight years ago \u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/03/05/israel-assassination-iranian-scientists-217223\">assassinated\u003c/a> Iranian scientists on Iranian soil. And America, for its part, has repeatedly signaled that it reserves the right to bomb Iran and that it would stand by Israel in the case of war with Iran.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Against the backdrop of Iranian history — including America’s support for Iraq in the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s, which produced hundreds of thousands of dead Iranians — it’s hardly surprising that Iran views both Israel and America as forces to be deterred; or that Iran sponsored anti-American Iraqi militias after a massive American military force invaded and occupied neighboring Iraq in 2003; or that when America and its allies armed Syrian rebels, thus turning a probably doomed insurrection into a full-scale civil war, Iran sent forces into Syria to save its longstanding ally, Bashar al-Assad’s regime, rather than see it toppled possibly by pro-American forces.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If you want this kind of insight into Iran’s perspective, I recommend avoiding the New York Times and checking out the latest issue of Foreign Affairs. There you’ll find a \u003ca href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2018-02-13/iran-among-ruins\">piece\u003c/a> by Vali Nasr, dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, called “Iran Among the Ruins.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Nasr writes that “the Israeli and U.S. militaries pose clear and present dangers to Iran.” He explains how this threat, along with hostile Arab neighbors and other perceived threats, has given rise to Iran’s policy of “forward defense.” He writes: “Although Iran’s rivals see the strategy of supporting nonstate military groups” — in Syria and Lebanon — “as an effort to export the revolution, the calculation behind it is utterly conventional.” Iran’s foreign policy, Nasr explains, is driven by national interest more than revolutionary fervor and “is far more pragmatic than many in the West comprehend.”\u003cbr />\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1024px;'>\u003cbr />\n\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/Vali-Nasr-1521213676.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-176629\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/Vali-Nasr-1521213676-1024x676.jpg\" alt=\"Dean of Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies Dr. Vali Nasr testifies before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about  &quot;Syria after Geneva&quot; on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, March 26, 2014.

But there’s no mention of Iranian “fears” or “worries” or perceived “danger.” There’s also no mention of what, from an Iranian perspective, is a glaring asymmetry: Iranians and Iranian proxies in Syria are there with the permission of Syria’s government. But when Israeli jets routinely enter Syrian airspace to bomb those proxies, Israel doesn’t have the government’s permission and so, is violating international law. So too with the American troops that are stationed in Syria without the government’s permission and that have fought against pro-Assad forces; this is illegal under any but the most tortured reading of international law.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Far from highlighting this asymmetry, the Times story could give the casual reader the idea that the asymmetry points in the other direction. The story opens with this sentence: “When an Iranian drone flew into Israeli airspace this month …” No mention of the fact that this incursion, apparently by a surveillance drone, not an armed drone, was such an aberration that some observers think it was accidental. And no mention of the many Israeli violations of Syrian airspace that had preceded it, sometimes with lethal consequences. (And, at the risk of getting too picky, no mention of the fact that the “Israeli airspace” the Times said was violated was actually over the Golan Heights, which under international law is Israeli-occupied Syrian territory.)\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-left' data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='left'>The unbalanced presentation isn’t surprising in light of the Times reporters’ choice of sources.\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>This unbalanced presentation isn’t surprising in light of the Times reporters’ choice of sources. They quote an American official and an Israeli official and a former Israeli official, but no Iranian officials or former officials. And their selection of D.C. think tanks to rely on for analysis doesn’t exactly skew to the left.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The first Washington think-tank expert quoted in the piece is Amir Toumaj from the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. As John Judis noted in a Slate \u003ca href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2015/08/foundation_for_the_defense_of_democracies_inside_the_small_pro_israel_think.html\">profile\u003c/a> of this think tank several years ago, back when the Iran nuclear deal was taking shape, FDD’s “positions have closely tracked those of the Likud party and its leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — not just on the Iran deal, but on the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians and the desirability of a two-state solution.” In its original application for tax-exempt status, FDD — then called EMET, the Hebrew word for ‘truth’ — said its mission was “to provide education to enhance Israel’s image in North America and the public’s understanding of issues affecting Israeli-Arab relations.” FDD has gotten funding from various far-right, “pro-Israel” donors, including Sheldon Adelson, who once \u003ca href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Adelson-US-should-drop-atomic-bomb-on-Iran-329641\">seriously proposed\u003c/a> dropping a nuclear bomb on Iran — just in the desert, he emphasized, to convey that “we mean business.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>So, naturally, when the New York Times is assembling a story about a conflict between Israel and Iran, it turns for impartial guidance to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>FDD does an impressive job of cultivating experts who can give journalists useful and sometimes hard-to-find information — and who, in return, get quoted a lot in the media. Almost invariably, the quotes strike a balance: They don’t overtly editorialize — and indeed are often defensible observations insofar as they go — yet they carry a subtle slant. The FDD quote in the Times piece is a good example: “The ultimate goal is, in the case of another war, to make Syria a new front between Israel, Hezbollah and Iran. They are making that not just a goal, but a reality.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It’s no doubt true that if there’s a war with Israel, Iran would rather it not take place in Iran. But nowhere in the New York Times piece is there even consideration of the possibility that from Iran’s point of view the main point of robust proxy forces in Syria and Lebanon is to reduce the chances of war by deterring Israeli and American aggression.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I’m not saying we know that’s the case; I’m just saying this possibility is taken seriously by enough experts to warrant, say, 20 or 30 words in the course of a 1,700-word piece whose headline says Iran aims to “menace” Israel. Yet the Times piece never suggests that Iranian strategy could be aimed at reducing the threat to Iran by any means other than pushing the arena for war away from Iran’s borders.\u003cbr />\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'>\u003cbr />\n\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/Israel--1521216160.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-article-large wp-image-176648\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/Israel--1521216160-1000x652.jpg\" alt=\"A picture taken on February 11, 2018 shows an Israeli soldiers deployed in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights near the border with Syria.Israel issued stark warnings on Sunday over Iran's presence in neighbouring Syria after a confrontation threatened to open a new and unpredictable period in the country's seven-year civil war. / AFP PHOTO / JALAA MAREY (Photo credit should read JALAA MAREY/AFP/Getty Images)\" />\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption overlayed\">A picture taken on Feb. 11, 2018, shows an Israeli soldiers deployed in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights near the border with Syria.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class='caption source pullright' style=''>Photo: Jalaa Marey/AFP/Getty Images\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003cbr />\n\u003cu>The Times piece\u003c/u> includes a powerful visual aid: a map of Syria showing lots of “long-term positions held by Iranian forces or their allies.” I have no idea how this data was gathered, so I guess we’ll have to trust the source. But if you look at the credit line, you’ll see that the source is the Institute for the Study of War, another D.C. think tank whose objectivity is dubious at best.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Institute for the Study of War’s ideological \u003ca href=\"http://rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/institute_for_the_study_of_war/\">profile is clear\u003c/a>: Its board members have included various neoconservatives, such as Bill Kristol, and it has gotten money from neoconservative and otherwise hawkish donors (including, in fact, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies), as well as from defense contractors. The institute’s founder and president has argued for U.S.-backed regime change in Syria because, as she put it, the &#8220;security of the United States and its allies would be significantly enhanced if Assad fell and Iranian influence over Syria were removed.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Times piece does mention one D.C. think tank that isn’t ultra-hawkish. Near the end there’s a quote from an expert at the vaguely centrist Atlantic Council. But it turns out that this particular expert, Ali Alfoneh, was until 2016 at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and before that was at the neoconservative American Enterprise Institute.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Alfoneh’s quote is: “Iran has realized that it is actually possible to maintain a front against Israel where there is no war but also no peace.” No mention of the fact that virtually all violent encounters between Israel and Iranian proxies in Syria — the incidents that have meant there is “no peace” — have been initiated by Israel, not the proxies.\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-right' data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='right'>Reporters from the Times are relying for “analysis” on sources that, in some cases, seem intent on drawing the U.S. into military conflict with Iran.\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>The New York Times famously helped get America into the Iraq War with reporting, by Judith Miller and others, that relied heavily on neoconservative and other hawkish sources. This reporting helped keep us from understanding what was going on in Saddam Hussein’s head: He was trying to hold onto power in Iraq and save as much face as possible, not hide a secret weapons of mass destruction program.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This misreading was abetted not just by the Times, but by various media outlets and various think tanks, ranging from the American Enterprise Institute to the “liberal” Brookings Institution.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And now we’re repeating the exercise with Iran. Reporters from the Times and other media outlets are, like Miller, relying for “analysis” on sources that, in some cases, seem intent on drawing the U.S. into military conflict with Iran. And it’s not as if these sources are keeping their agenda hidden. A week before the Times piece ran, Mark Dubowitz, CEO of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/mdubowitz/status/962754501299130369\">tweeted\u003c/a> in support of the idea that the U.S. military should attack “vulnerable Iranian forces” in Syria.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One reason the reality distortion field surrounding Iran has gotten so amped up is that Washington’s traditional source of funding for specifically anti-Iran talking points — far-right, “pro-Israel” donors — has increasingly been supplemented by money from Sunni Arab states that are Iran’s regional rivals. Another is that various players in the Trump administration have various \u003ca href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/james-mattis-iran-secretary-of-defense-214500\">reasons\u003c/a> for favoring anti-Iran policies.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Still, Iran isn’t the only case of a media-abetted perceptual distortion that could bring war. The extent to which both North Korea’s and Russia’s behavior is defensively driven tends to get underplayed, and the craziness of their leaders — particularly in the case of Kim Jong-un but \u003ca href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/116852/merkel-was-right-putins-lost-his-mind-press-conference\">occasionally\u003c/a> in the case of Russian President Vladimir Putin — tends to get overplayed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In all of these cases — Iran, Russia, and North Korea — the problem is a lack of cognitive empathy, a failure to understand what’s going on inside the heads of adversaries. The good news is that cognitive empathy is often not as hard to muster as emotional empathy; you don’t have to try to feel sorry for leaders who have done horrible things. The bad news is that cognitive empathy is harder than it seems and can be impeded by activating such emotions as fear.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For that reason, it’s understandable that Israelis wouldn’t extend much cognitive empathy toward Iran. Given Israel’s history and the hostility it faces from various neighbors — and the way some Iranian leaders spout anti-Zionism talking points — it’s only natural that many Israelis and many of Israel’s most ardent American supporters dismiss as hopelessly naïve the idea I’ve put forth: That Iran, too, has deep fears about its security and these may explain some of its seemingly threatening behavior. By the same token, it’s understandable that people in Gaza and Lebanon who have endured massive and deadly Israeli military campaigns doubt the Israeli claim that these are motivated defensively, to preserve a security that feels tenuous.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Think tanks” that actually deserve that name should help us transcend these and other tribal perspectives, not reinforce them; help strengthen, not impede, cognitive empathy.

Antifa, which is short for anti-fascist, is not a group or an organization, but a set of political practices aimed at expunging neo-Nazi, white nationalist, and adjacent groups from public spaces on and offline. While these practices, which include but are not limited to physical confrontations, have been deployed against fascists since the early 20th Century, President Donald Trump’s election and the resurgence of overt white supremacy brought antifa opposition to the fore. Where white nationalists gather &#8212; from Berkeley to Boston to Charlottesville &#8212; antifa has been there with the intent to disrupt those gatherings.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A cottage industry of panicked media commentary has \u003ca href=\"https://fair.org/home/in-month-after-charlottesville-papers-spent-as-much-time-condemning-anti-nazis-as-nazis/\">dedicated\u003c/a> itself to decrying the threats antifa and its “no-platforming” stance pose to free speech. Suffice it to say this all-too-prevalent media position is \u003ca href=\"http://evergreenreview.com/read/anti-fascist-practice-and-impossible-non-violence/\">deeply flawed\u003c/a>. The aspect of those criticisms that is relevant for our purposes here is the claim that antifa action is not effective. Critics even claim antifa’s approach is counterproductive, giving oxygen to the attention-grabbing white supremacist fire it would extinguish. \u003ca href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/noam-chomsky-antifa-major-gift-right-wing-anti-fascist-alt-left-a7906406.html\">Noam Chomsky\u003c/a> was far from alone in calling antifa “a major gift” to the far right. Instead, critics argue that the best way to defeat the far right was to debate them, to shed light on the paucity of their arguments, to reason white supremacy away.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Spencer’s latest message suggests the very opposite. “The idea of a college tour was going into the belly of the beast — going into academic, Marxist-controlled territory — and giving a speech that introduces that basic ideas of identitarianism and the &#8216;alt-right,&#8217;” he said in his video, emphasizing the use of “public-facing” events to spread and normalize the &#8220;alt-right&#8221; message. Anyone who has watched Spencer and his ilk in public debates with liberals on the question of race should see how the belief that his violent white supremacy can be reasoned away is flawed. He \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/nov/06/gary-younge-interviews-richard-spencer-africans-have-benefited-from-white-supremacy\">sticks\u003c/a> to his guns about the necessity of a white &#8220;ethno-state,&#8221; and his liberal interlocutor calls him a monstrous racist. The result is that anti-racists agree with the liberals and racists agree with Spencer. The effect, as both sides hold to their arguments, is mere entrenchment of an intolerable status quo — or, worse yet, closet racists decide Spencer’s arguments license them to come out publicly, too.\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-none' data-shortcode-type='pullquote' data-pull='none'>The antifa strategy aims to create material, felt consequences for neo-Nazi, white supremacist groups, and those who would organize with them.\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>\u003cu>Instead of this\u003c/u> deteriorating stalemate, the antifa strategy aims to create material, felt consequences for neo-Nazi, white supremacist groups, and those who would organize with them. The approach takes seriously that young, white, often alienated men see promise, belonging, and elevation in these organizations. They don’t join groups \u003ca href=\"https://www.adl.org/resources/profiles/identity-evropa\">like\u003c/a> Identity Evropa, an American white supremacist group which has focused heavily on campus propaganda, because of the strength of their arguments — and they won’t leave such communities because of the flawed logic of their ideology, either.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To make the consequences of joining the white nationalist movement appear less appealing &#8212; to take the “fun” out of fascism &#8212; is precisely the antifa strategy to stymie the movement&#8217;s spread. Spencer stating that his rallies are no longer “fun” is music to antifa ears.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It is no accident that antifa tactics \u003ca href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/an-intimate-history-of-antifa\">beat\u003c/a> back the rise of neo-Nazism in the 1970s and 1980s punk scene, or that fighting squads of Jewish ex-service members \u003ca href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3csv25d\">halted\u003c/a> the upsurge of Oswald Mosley’s anti-Semitic, fascist organizing in Britain after World War II. And it’s no surprise that the so-called alt-right has been forced to reconsider its tactics today. While writers for the New York Times opinion section may seek to paint the antifa position as little more than punch-seeking thuggery, the strategy of creating serious consequences for white nationalists who would organize is based on a well-grounded understanding of the desire for fascism and how it spreads.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Spencer has not declared the &#8220;alt-right&#8221; defeated, and his message certainly signals no death knell for the white supremacy that permeates this country’s DNA. As I’ve \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/02/14/alt-right-campus-free-speech-adl-splc/\">noted\u003c/a>, the Anti-Defamation League found that last year, white supremacist propaganda tripled on campuses across America and far right extremism accounted for 71 percent of extremist attacks. Spencer is also just one personality; the far right doesn’t hinge on his college appearances.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Some may argue that Spencer’s plans to become less public-facing, to organize more secretive meetings such that antifa will not be able to turn up, creates more dangerous possibilities for a movement to spread out of sight. The idea, however, that a movement forced underground — whatever that looks like in the age of social media organizing — is more likely to gain traction is unfounded and unempirical.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If &#8220;alt-right&#8221; speakers do go “underground,” where they will lack police lines and university establishment protections, antifa will be sure to follow them there, too. An antifa tactic that gets less media coverage than Nazi-punching involves intensive online research dedicated exposing who, where, and how groups are connecting and organizing. That’s the whole point of antifa: To do the work, by whatever means necessary, so that the far right has nowhere left to go.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">Top photo: White nationalist Richard Spencer, who popularized the term &#8220;alt-right,&#8221; speaks during a press conference at the Curtis M.

But the role of signals intelligence in Iraq was not over. \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2830086-king-of-diamonds-apprehended-in-iraq/\">The NSA provided “time-sensitive SIGINT” support\u003c/a>, including a “summary of contacts,” to aid the May 22, 2003, capture of a top Baathist official, Aziz Sajih Al-Numan, “king of diamonds” in the deck of playing cards that featured U.S. Central Command’s wanted Iraqis.

But that wasn’t the only time the agency influenced diplomacy: In 2002, signals intelligence ignited a confrontation between North Korea and the U.S., according to \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829973-uncovering-north-korea-nuclear-programs/\">a \u003cem>SIDtoday \u003c/em>article from April 2003\u003c/a>.

Though the program associated with this monitoring, FORNSAT, has been previously \u003ca href=\"https://www.aclu.org/foia-document/primary-fornsat-collection-operations\">disclosed\u003c/a>, this document adds important context. For example, it made FORNSAT sound like an intelligence gold mine, having “consistently provided … over 25 percent of end product reporting.” It also explained what sorts of information the NSA gleaned from satellites — “intelligence derived from diplomatic communications … airline reservations and billing data … traffic about terrorists, international crime, weapons of mass destruction … international finance and trade.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The problem, at the time the article was written, was that FORNSAT was in “dire need of upgrade” because it was “primarily engineered for voice” communications and needed to shift to intercepting more digital communications, including digital video. It also needed to be expanded to tap into mobile satellite phone systems, which “use hundreds of spot beams. Our 13 fixed FORNSAT sites cannot provide the necessary access.”\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Leaks Included in 5,000 “Insecurity Records”\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>Ten years before Edward Snowden gave a trove of NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, a “chief” within SID’s Communications and Support Operations organization \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829987-profile-intelligence-security-issues/\">described in \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> the great lengths the agency went to in order to track leaks\u003c/a>. In a profile of the Intelligence Security Issues office within CSO, this person said that ISI scanned 350 press items daily for “cryptologic insecurities” and maintained a database called FIRSTFRUIT with “over 5,000 insecurity-related records” ranging from “espionage damage assessments” to “liaison exchanges.” This ISI profile ran as part of a broader \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/?topic=communications-and-support-operations-cso#archive\">series on the CSO organization\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Technology Pushed NSA Into the Tablet Era — and Tons of Gear Went Missing\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>One theme that emerges from early 2003 \u003cem>SIDtoday \u003c/em>installments is that the NSA was grappling with how to handle advances in information technology, particularly the proliferation of mobile devices and online networks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One article in the \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/?topic=customer-relations#archive\">“Customer Relations” series\u003c/a> described several “\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829992-dynamic-methods-of-interaction-with-new-and/\">dynamic dissemination products\u003c/a>” to help SID “change with … our customers,” including an initiative to distribute “secret-level information” to wireless devices, a technique for disseminating “NSA product” to tablet computers, and a system to view secret documents on unclassified computers over the internet, bypassing the need for a high-security enclosed area known as a SCIF. These efforts foreshadowed Hillary Clinton’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/how-clintons-email-scandal-took-root/2016/03/27/ee301168-e162-11e5-846c-10191d1fc4ec_story.html\">controversial\u003c/a> use, as secretary of state, of a BlackBerry device to traffic in sensitive government information after the NSA reportedly rebuffed her request for a special secure device from the agency.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2830027-sid-property-inventory-starts-next-week/\">Another article\u003c/a> highlighted that the NSA was a heavy user of mobile devices even four years before the release of the first iPhone, calling on staffers to help catalogue all computers, including “laptops, palmtops/PDAs, etc.,” for an annual inventory.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The document also stated that $27 million worth of equipment remained “unaccounted for” after the prior year’s audit, which ended just two months earlier.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In addition to making secret information accessible to more people, SID was developing new systems to solve long-standing problems. The JOURNEYMAN program, \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2830013-what-is-journeyman/\">described in another article\u003c/a>, aimed to develop a system for distributing SIGINT reports to many different recipients at once across different networks with different formatting requirements. \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2830069-patenthammer/\">Another system, PATENTHAMMER\u003c/a>, collected cellular, fax, and pager signals for the Special Operations Command and also allowed users to access information collected in the past.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>SID was also still exploring the rapidly evolving internet. One article described how the NSA was improving its integration with the public internet via a program \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2830068-outparks-a-new-internet-for-nsa/\">called OUTPARKS\u003c/a>. Another \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2830032-sigint-development-2003-conference/\">touted\u003c/a> the NSA’s annual SIGDEV conference, a major event \u003ca href=\"https://niccs.us-cert.gov/news-events/nsa-sigint-development-conference-2015\">in which\u003c/a> analysts from the “\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes\">five eyes\u003c/a>” intelligence agencies in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States share techniques for developing new SIGINT.

And the demand from customers exploded in 2003, judging from a \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/?topic=customer-relations#archive\">series of \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> articles about the Customer Relationships Directorate\u003c/a>, an office focused on ensuring that NSA’s customers get what they need.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One driver of this demand was the war on terror; inbound SIGINT requests to the NSA’s National Security Operations Center went from 300 in the two weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks to 1,700 by the end of the year, according to \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829985-information-needs-management-careful-planning/\">one \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> article\u003c/a>. Existing customers like the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture “suddenly became voracious consumers” of signals intelligence, as \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829992-dynamic-methods-of-interaction-with-new-and/\">one article from April 2003 \u003c/a>put it, and brand new customers appeared on the scene, such as the newly created Department of Homeland Security. SID also increased its interaction with domestic law enforcement agencies like the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Another driver of heightened SIGINT demand was the war in Iraq. According to the \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829994-a-perspective-on-the-nsa-usun-partnership/\">document\u003c/a> describing the NSA’s role in war-related U.N. Security Council resolutions, “The number of timely SIGINT tippers delivered to [the U.S. Mission to the United Nations] during key points in the negotiations increased by a factor of four.”\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Creating a “Plausible Cover” for Sensitive Intelligence Sources\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>Amid strong demand for intelligence, the NSA sometimes needed to alter sensitive information so it could be shared more widely.

Another column, “SIGINT Philosopher,” delved into the ethics of surveillance (reliably coming out on the favorable side) and was written by a language analyst who described a personal epiphany that came during a polygraph exam. “Signal v. Noise” explored the difficulties involved in collecting large amounts of data, while “SIGINT Curmudgeon” was written by a longtimer who waxed nostalgic about the good old days of eavesdropping. (None of these columns were up and running in the initial batch of \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday\">just released\u003c/a> by \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em>, but I have written previously \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2014/03/07/nsa-advice-columnist-seriously/\">about “Ask Zelda!”\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/08/11/surveillance-philosopher-nsa/\">the “SIGINT Philosopher\u003c/a>.” In both cases, \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em> simultaneously published copies of the original columns.)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One of the cultural revelations in the archives of \u003cem>SIDtoday \u003c/em>is the corporate language that was routinely used. Intelligence reports delivered to other government agencies were described as “products,” and there was a category called the “\u003ca href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2830623-2009-08-05-SIDToday-Does-NSA-Look-Different-From.html\">Counterterrorism Product Line\u003c/a>.” Government agencies that received these reports were known as “customers,” and the NSA has an entire division called the “Customer Relationship Directorate.” One of the \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> articles published today was titled “\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829992-dynamic-methods-of-interaction-with-new-and/\">Dynamic Methods of Interaction With New and Existing Customers\u003c/a>,” and it referred to “product line leaders” at the agency who created “customer support plans” that included details on what “each customer needs.” The customers mentioned in the article included the Department of Homeland Security, Secret Service, Missile Defense Agency, and Federal Reserve. The article was written by an official whose title was “acting chief, customer gateway.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> articles also convey what officials at the agency were reading in their off-hours. Some articles included references to popular authors like the travel writer \u003ca href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2830626-2010-04-30-SIDToday-Learning-to-Love-English.html\">Bill Bryson\u003c/a>, the \u003cem>New Yorker\u003c/em> writer Malcolm Gladwell, and mid-century economist Herbert Simon. One of the articles released today was an \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2830090-book-review-cryptonomicon/\">enthusiastic review\u003c/a> of the Neal Stephenson sci-fi novel \u003cem>Cryptonomicon\u003c/em>, which was described in the article (written by a member of the communications team in the Signals Intelligence Directorate) as “an enthralling work that proves to be as much of a history lesson as an eye-opening thriller.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The articles, almost uniformly glowing about the NSA, serve as reminders that the men and women who surveil the world are not machines; they have good days and bad days, jokes and tears, and strange tales about their lives. A \u003ca href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2830621-2010-09-03-SIDToday-From-the-SIDtoday-Archives.html\">two\u003c/a>-part \u003ca href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2830622-2005-09-02-SIDToday-Odd-Jobs-Before-NSA-Part-2.html\">article\u003c/a> from 2005, “‘Odd Jobs’ Before NSA,” listed unconventional occupations that some employees had before joining the world’s largest electronic spying organization.

The title of one intern’s article for \u003cem>SIDtoday \u003c/em>in 2004 was “\u003ca href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2830627-2004-08-13-SIDToday-How-I-Spent-My-Summer-Vacation.html\">How I Spent My Summer Vacation\u003c/a>,” while \u003ca href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2830624-2011-7-27-Culture-Shock-NSA-From-the-Perspective.html\">another article\u003c/a> in 2011 recounted that on their first day of work, a boisterous group of interns stepped into an elevator and got a quick and stern lecture from “an older gentleman” who warned that “the only thing you need to know is that we don’t talk in the elevators, and the extroverts look at \u003cem>other\u003c/em> people’s shoes.” The interns silently shared the same reaction — “\u003cem>What have we gotten ourselves into\u003c/em>\u003cem>?\u003c/em>”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Related Stories:\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday\">Snowden Archive — The SIDtoday Files\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/the-intercept-is-broadening-access-to-the-snowden-archive-heres-why\">The Intercept Is Broadening Access to the Snowden Archive.

Gen. H. Steven Blum, “planned to take the prisoners into U.S. custody as soon as they were released by the Bosnians. The prisoners would be taken from Sarajevo up to Tuzla.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The staffer was tasked with watching for the possibility of an ambush on the military convoy. The men’s release, she wrote, “was delayed for several hours due to a large demonstration outside the building they were being held in,” and “the convoy did not leave Sarajevo until after midnight.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“The ‘gentlemen’ in question are still guests of the U.S. government, at Guantánamo Bay,” she wrote in the entry dated September 3, 2008.

As time has gone on, \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em> has sought out new ways to get documents from the archive into the hands of the public, consistent with the public interest as originally conceived.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Today, \u003ci>The Intercept \u003c/i>is announcing two innovations in how we report on and publish these materials. Both measures are designed to ensure that reporting on the archive continues in as expeditious and informative a manner as possible, in accordance with the agreements we entered into with our source about how these materials would be disclosed, a framework \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/715323533824548864?lang=en\">that he\u003c/a>, \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2014/03/23/facts-nsa-stories-reported/\">and we\u003c/a>, have publicly described on numerous occasions.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">The first measure involves the publication of large batches of documents. W\u003c/span>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">e are, beginning today, publishing in installments the NSA&#8217;s internal \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em>\u003c/span> \u003cspan class=\"s1\">newsletters, which span more than a decade beginning after 9/11. We are starting with the oldest \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> articles, from 2003, and working our way through the most recent in our archive, from 2012. Our first release today contains 166 documents, all from 2003, and we will periodically release batches until we have made public the entire set. \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday\">The documents are available on a special section of \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em>\u003c/a>.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">The \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em>\u003c/span> \u003cspan class=\"s1\">documents run a wide gamut: from serious, detailed reports on top secret NSA surveillance programs to breezy, trivial meanderings of analysts’\u003c/span> \u003cspan class=\"s1\">trips and vacations, with much in between. Many are self-serving and boastful, designed to justify budgets or impress supervisors. Others contain obvious errors or mindless parroting of public source material. But some \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> articles have been the basis of significant revelations from the archive. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">Accompanying the release of these documents are summaries of the content of each, along with a \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/nsa-closely-involved-in-guantanamo-interrogations-documents-show\">story about NSA’s role in Guantánamo interrogations\u003c/a>, a lengthy roundup of other \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/the-most-intriguing-spy-stories-from-166-internal-nsa-reports\">intriguing information gleaned from these files\u003c/a>, and a \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/what-its-like-to-read-the-nsas-newspaper-for-spies\">profile of \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em>\u003c/a>. We encourage other journalists, researchers, and interested parties to comb through these documents, along with future published batches, to find additional material of interest. Others may well find stories, or clues that lead to stories, that we did not. (To contact us about such finds, \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/about/#contact\">see the instructions here\u003c/a>.) A primary objective of these batch releases is to make that kind of exploration possible.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Consistent with the requirements of our agreement with our source, our editors and reporters have carefully examined each document, redacted names of low-level functionaries and other information that could impose serious harm on innocent individuals, and given the NSA an opportunity to comment on the documents to be published (the NSA&#8217;s comments resulted in no redactions other than two names of relatively low-level employees that we agreed, consistent with our long-standing policy, to redact). Further information about how we prepared the documents for publication is available \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/how-we-prepared-the-nsas-sensitive-internal-reports-for-release\">in a separate article\u003c/a>. We believe these releases will enhance public understanding of these extremely powerful and secretive surveillance agencies.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">The other innovation is our ability to invite outside journalists, including from foreign media outlets, to work with us to explore the full Snowden archive.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">From the start of our reporting on the archive, a major component of our approach has been to partner with foreign (and other American) media outlets rather than try to keep all the material for ourselves. We\u003cem> \u003c/em>have collectively shared documents with more than two dozen media outlets, and teams of journalists in numerous countries have thus worked with and reported on Snowden documents (that&#8217;s independent of the other media outlets which have long possessed large portions of the Snowden archive — the\u003ci> Washington Post\u003c/i>, the\u003ci> New York Times\u003c/i>, \u003ci>The Guardian\u003c/i>, \u003cem>ProPublica\u003c/em>). This partnership approach has greatly expedited the reporting, and also ensured that stories that most affect specific countries are reported by the journalists who best understand those countries.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">But allowing other journalists full access to the archive presented security and legal challenges that took time and resources to resolve. We now feel comfortable that we can do so consistent with the responsibility demanded by these materials and our agreement with our source. We have begun to provide archive access to journalists from \u003ci>Le Monde\u003c/i> and other media outlets in collaboration with \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em>’s editorial, research, legal, and technology teams. \u003c/span>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">We are excited by the reporting this new arrangement will generate. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">There are still many documents of legitimate interest to the public that can and should be disclosed. There are also documents in the archive that we do not believe should be published because of the severe harm they would cause innocent people (e.g., private communications intercepted by NSA, the disclosure of which would destroy privacy rights; and documents containing government speculation about bad acts committed by private individuals (typically from marginalized communities), the disclosure of which would permanently destroy reputations). \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">An archive of this significance and size obviously presents complicated questions about how best to report on it. There is rarely one easy, obvious answer how to do it. Different leaks may require different approaches. I’ve always believed that WikiLeaks’\u003c/span> \u003cspan class=\"s1\">reporting on and disclosure of the materials provided by Chelsea Manning and other sources have been superb. But that does not mean that it is the only viable framework, or the optimal tactical approach, for all leaks. Moreover, different whistleblowers have their own conditions and demands for how the material can be disclosed, which any ethical journalist must obviously honor in full.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">We have navigated these difficult and sometimes conflicting values in deciding how best to report on this massive archive. These two new approaches will, we believe, facilitate reporting and disclosure while fulfilling our obligations to the public and to our source. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Related Stories:\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday\">Snowden Archive — The SIDtoday Files\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/15/how-we-prepared-the-nsas-sensitive-internal-reports-for-release\">How We Prepared the NSA’s Sensitive Internal Reports for Release\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/15/nsa-closely-involved-in-guantanamo-interrogations-documents-show\">NSA Closely Involved in Guantánamo Interrogations, Documents Show\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/15/the-most-intriguing-spy-stories-from-166-internal-nsa-reports\">The Most Intriguing Spy Stories From 166 Internal NSA Reports\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/what-its-like-to-read-the-nsas-newspaper-for-spies/\">The NSA’s Newspaper Reveals the Human Side of America’s Digital Spies\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n","credit_additional_reporting":"","credit_additional_reporting_users_object":"","credit_photo_illustration":"","credit_research":"","credit_research_users_object":"","credit_translation":"","credit_translation_users_object":"","date":"2016-05-16T15:37:52+00:00","date_local":"2016-05-16T11:37:52+00:00","documents":"","excerpt":"We’ve begun to release large batches of Snowden documents to the public — and to open the archive to greater access by foreign and U.S. journalists.","excerpt_type":"default","feature_header_background_color":"","feature_header_color":"","feature_header_layout":"","feature_image_mask":"","feature_interactive_url":"","feature_text_color":"","feature_title":"Featured News","featured_video_url":"","hide_featured_image":false,"inline_featured_image":false,"is_banner_hidden":false,"is_feature":"0","language":{"code":"en","name":"English","slug":"english"},"language_related_post_ids":"","language_related_post_permalinks":"","layout":"default","link":"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/the-intercept-is-broadening-access-to-the-snowden-archive-heres-why/","meta":{"links":[]},"mobile_thumbnail":null,"partner_feeds":null,"partnership":{"article_logo":"","article_logo_blurb":"","article_text_color":"","homepage_background_color":"","homepage_featured":"","homepage_logo":"","homepage_logo_blurb":"","homepage_text_color":"","module_type":"","partner":"","partner_url":"","video_module_post_description":"","video_module_post_image":"","video_module_post_title":""},"post_type":"post","prefer_talk_comments":false,"related_post_ids":"","related_post_permalinks":"","series":"","series_part_number":"","share_twitter_text":"The Intercept is broadening access to the @Snowden archive.
