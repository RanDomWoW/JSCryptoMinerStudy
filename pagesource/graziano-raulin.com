		Welcome to the Textbook Website to the the Eighth
        Edition of the Graziano and Raulin <em>Research Methods</em> textbook.
        This website takes students well beyond the passive learning that comes 
		from reading, to an active processing of the material that will enhance 
		learning and the enjoyment of learning.&nbsp;</p>
			<p align="left">
		The menu bar on the top of the screen is
        the primary navigation tool for the website. There are so many resources
        on the website that we have grouped them into broad categories as
