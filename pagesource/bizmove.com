  <p align="left">Whether you are presently running your own business or just  planning to start one, you'll find here all the guidelines and tools you need  to start, operate and succeed in a business of your own.</p>
<p align="left">  The first and most important thing you need to acquire in order to succeed  in a small business is... knowledge.</p>
<p align="left">  Sounds exaggerated? Listen to this<strong>...</strong></p>
<p align="left">  According to research conducted by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, 90% of all small  business failures can be traced to poor management resulting from lack of  knowledge. </p>
 

<p align="left">  This is backed up by our own personal observations. As veteran entrepreneurs  and business coaches, we've seen practically dozens of business owners go under  and lose their businesses - not because they weren't talented or smart enough  - but because they were trying to re-invent the wheel rather than rely on  proven, tested methods that work. </p>
<p align="left">  And that is where this website can help - with over 300 'how-to' guides,  dozens of free books, worksheets and tools - it will show you how to avoid the  common traps and mistakes and do everything right the first time. You'll  discover here scores of easy to follow strategies, techniques and shortcuts -  so that you'll be able to start using them at once. I hope you find this site useful.<br>

     <p align="left">The first

        is &quot;Am I the type?&quot; You will be the most important employee in your

        your strengths and your weaknesses. As a prospective operator of your 
        own  business, acknowledge that you are weak in certain areas and 
        cover the deficiency by either retraining yourself or hiring someone 
        with the necessary skill. The questions in this quiz indicate to what

            The dangers that wait to assail   you.<br>
            But just buckle right in with a bit of a grin,<br>
            Then take off your coat and   go to it;<br>
            Just start in to sing as you tackle the thing<br>
      That cannot be done, and   you'll do it.  </p>
