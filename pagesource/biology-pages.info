The pages represent an <b>online biology textbook</b>. 
<p>
It has always seemed to me that the many parts that make up the subject of biology are related to each other more like the nodes of a web than as a linear collection of independent topics. So I believe that the power of hypertext will be better suited to learning about biology than is the linear structure of a printed textbook.
</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of printed textbooks is the inevitable delay between the time that new advances in  biology are reported and the time that they can become incorporated in a printed book (often several years). Material here can be updated promptly.
</p>
<p>So although some of this information has been drawn from the sixth edition of the author's text <strong>Biology</strong> published in 1994 by Wm. C. Brown, every effort has been made to adapt the material to the opportunities provided by an online text.</p>

<h2><a name="about_the_author">About the Author</a></h2>

<p>John W. Kimball has retired from a lifetime of teaching biology. A graduate of Harvard College, he began his teaching career at the secondary level, teaching chemistry and biology to students at Phillips Academy, an independent school in Andover, Massachusetts. In 1969, he returned to Harvard to study immunology with the late Professor A. M. Pappenheimer. After receiving his Ph.D. there, he went on to teach introductory biology (in both majors and nonmajors courses) and immunology at Tufts University where he became a tenured professor. In 1982 he returned again to Harvard where he taught immunology and also participated in teaching the introductory course for majors.</p>

<img alt="" width=94 height=123 border=1 align=right src="J/JaguarLogo.gif">

<p>The first edition of Kimball's general biology text was published in 1965. Since that time it has gone through five revisions, the most recent being the sixth edition, which appeared in 1994 (that's its cover on the right). He has also published books on cell biology and a widely-used text on immunology. His biology books have also been published in Spanish, German, Japanese, Arabic, Polish, Korean and Indonesian versions.</p>
