<strong>General Website Terms and Conditions</strong><br />
Thank you for visiting the SpotHero, Inc. (&#8220;SpotHero,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) website at SpotHero.com (the &#8220;Site&#8221;). Your use of the information, materials, text, images and other content on the Site is subject to the terms and conditions below, which we may revise from time to time without notice. Please read these terms and conditions carefully. <strong>BY ACCESSING THE SITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE GENERAL WEBSITE TERMS AND CONDITIONS (THESE &#8220;TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#8221;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Services:</strong> Unless expressly stated otherwise, the services provided by SpotHero (the “Marketing Services”) are limited to informing users of the location and potential availability of certain parking spots (“Parking Spots”) and facilitating Reservations (as defined below) by displaying Parking Spots, processing Reservations and collecting fees on behalf of Licensors (as defined below). Any fees and/or consideration paid to SpotHero is paid to SpotHero in connection with these Marketing Services unless otherwise indicated. To be clear, SpotHero does not: (i) negotiate terms of licenses or settle disputes between users of the Site; (ii) provide a parking service; (iii) operate a parking lot or other parking facility; (iv) otherwise accept custody of motor vehicles; or (v) provide services other than the Marketing Services (collectively, &#8220;Excluded Services&#8221;). The Excluded Services are provided by Licensors who are neither our agents nor acting in our behalf and we have no responsibility whatsoever regarding the safety of persons or property in the Parking Spots or any facility where the Parking Spots are located found through use of the Site. We are not responsible for any consequences arising from the Excluded Services, including, without limitation, consequences arising from not being able to park or delays associated with parking, road closures or changing traffic conditions. Although we do not guarantee the availability of a specific Parking Spot, if a booked Parking Spot is unavailable at your time of reservation, we will attempt to locate an alternative Parking Spot, provide you with a refund and/or otherwise resolve any issues in accordance with our standard customer service policies and procedures.</p>
<p><b>Licensors; Licensor Terms and Conditions</b>: SpotHero lists the Parking Spots on the Site and, as such, facilitates the reservation of Parking Spots (&#8220;<u>Reservations</u>&#8220;) between users of the Site (“<u>Licensees</u>” or “<u>you</u>”), and the independent owners, lessors, managers or operators of the Parking Spots (the &#8220;<u>Licensors</u>&#8220;). SpotHero does not establish the prices for Parking Spots, operate Parking Spots, or determine parking availability provided by Licensors. While SpotHero makes every effort to provide accurate information regarding the Parking Spots listed on the Site, at times such information may become inaccurate and SpotHero shall not be liable for any such inaccuracy. In all cases, your utilization of a Parking Spot will be governed by Licensor’s customer agreements or policies in place from time to time, including, without limitation, all terms and conditions related to the use of any Parking Spot, any payment terms and conditions and all rules and restrictions imposed by the Licensor on the relevant parking facility and/or Parking Spot, as each may be entered into or effected in accordance with the Licensor’s standard operating procedures (the “<u>Licensor Terms and Conditions</u>”). By making a Reservation, you agree in all cases to abide by the Licensor Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>In connection with our provision of the Marketing Services, Licensors may represent and warrant to us that they have full authority to list the Parking Spots for Reservations. We are not responsible for confirming whether any such representation or warranty is true and correct, nor are we responsible if any such representation or warrant becomes inaccurate or incomplete prior to your use of a Parking Spot. In addition, SpotHero will never be responsible for any agreement or other arrangements between you and any Licensor, regardless of whether such agreement or other arrangements are related to your booking and use of a Parking Spot.</p>
<p><strong>User Accounts:</strong> In order to access certain areas of the Site, you will create a user account and login (a &#8220;User Account&#8221;). You agree that all information which you provide through the Site in connection with creating your User Account or otherwise is current, accurate and complete. You are solely responsible for all activity that occurs with respect to your User Account. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your User Account and keeping the username and password to your User Account secure. You agree to notify us immediately of any security breach or unauthorized use of your User Account. We will not be liable for any costs, losses, claims or damages that you or any third party incur which are directly or indirectly caused by any unauthorized use of your User Account. You agree to never use another party’s User Account without such party’s express written authorization</p>
<p><strong>Use of Content:</strong> The text, images, data, illustrations, files, audio and video clips, designs, documents and other materials and content (collectively, the &#8220;Content&#8221;) on the Site is our property and may be protected by copyright and other restrictions. Copyrights and other proprietary rights in the Content may also be owned by parties other than us. You may not copy, modify, distribute or otherwise use any of the Content, except for your personal and non-commercial use. Please note that we may withdraw any Content from the Site at any time in our sole discretion.</p>
<p><strong>User Warranty:</strong> By downloading, printing, or otherwise using any of the Content, you agree that you will (i) restrict your use of such Content to personal and non-commercial use, (ii) comply with all of these Terms and Conditions, and (iii) not violate our rights or the rights of any other person or entity. We do not warrant that use of any of the Content will not infringe the rights of third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial Use is Restricted:</strong> Unauthorized commercial publication or exploitation of text, images, documents, materials or any other Content is prohibited without our express written consent. If you wish to use any of the Content for commercial use, publication, or any purpose other than personal use, you must obtain our express written permission prior to such use. We may, in our sole discretion, grant permission for such use on a case-by-case basis and we may charge a usage fee for such use. Without limitation of the foregoing, you agree that you may not sell, convey, license, sublicense, or resell or attempt any of the foregoing.</p>
<p><strong>Fees and Payments:</strong> You are responsible for all charges, fees, duties, taxes, and assessments arising out of any Reservation, the use of a Parking Spot, the Marketing Services or the use of the Site. You agree to pay to SpotHero all fees for (including any overage fees) for SpotHero’s provision of the Marketing Services, in accordance with the pricing and payment terms presented to you for such Marketing Services. Where applicable, you will be billed using the billing method you select through your User Account management page. Except as provided in these Terms and Conditions or when required by law, all fees paid by you are non-refundable SpotHero may change the fees for any Marketing Services, including any Marketing Services billed pursuant to a Subscription (as defined below), at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> In the event that any of the Marketing Services are billed on a Subscription basis (&#8220;Subscriptions&#8221;), you will be billed in advance on a recurring, periodic basis (each period, a &#8220;Billing Cycle&#8221;). Billing Cycles are typically monthly or annual, depending on what Subscription you select when purchasing a Subscription. Your Subscription will automatically renew at the end of each Billing Cycle unless you cancel auto-renewal through your User Account management page, or by contacting our customer support team. While we will be sad to see you go, you may cancel auto-renewal on your Subscription at any time, in which case your Subscription will continue until the end of the then-current Billing Cycle before terminating. If SpotHero changes the fees for any Marketing Services billed pursuant to a Subscription, the change will become effective only at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle. SpotHero will provide you with reasonable prior written notice of any change in fees to give you an opportunity to cancel your Subscription before the change becomes effective.</p>
<p><b>Taxes and Overage Fees</b>: In connection with facilitating your transaction, SpotHero will charge your credit card for the total reservation price, which includes the amount for the Parking Spots, a fee retained by SpotHero for providing their services in facilitating the Reservations, and all anticipated applicable taxes.  SpotHero retains a service fee as compensation for facilitating reservations and for providing Marketing Services.  The amounts paid to the Licensors in connection with your reservation include all anticipated applicable taxes for the Parking Spots.  The Licensors are responsible for remitting applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions.  SpotHero is not a vendor collecting and remitting taxes to the applicable taxing authorities nor a co-vendor associated with the vendor with whom SpotHero reserves its customer&#8217;s Parking Spots. If you are required by law to withhold any Taxes from your payments to SpotHero, you must provide SpotHero with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such payments. Unless otherwise stated, any overage fees incurred by you will be billed in arrears on a monthly basis. Overage fees which remain unpaid for 30 days after being billed are considered overdue. Failure to pay overage fees when due may result in the applicable service being limited, suspended, or terminated (subject to applicable legal requirements), which may result in a loss of your data associated with that service.</p>
<p><strong>Cancellations and Refunds:</strong> Reservations purchased through the Site are fully refundable up to 24 hours before the start of the Reservation unless noted otherwise. You can cancel a Reservation for any reason before that time unless noted otherwise. Within 24 hours of the start of the Reservation, all Reservations are non-refundable, regardless of your use or non-use of the Reservation and regardless of any circumstance surrounding the use or non-use of a Reservation (i.e., traffic or weather delays, cancellation of a related event).</p>
<p>SpotHero may from time to time partner with third parties (“Partner”), and Reservations purchased on Partner websites are not refundable for any reason.</p>
<p><strong>Promotional Marketing Incentives:</strong> SpotHero may from time to time issue promotional marketing incentives in the form of promotional codes, promotional discounts, coupon codes, Referral Credits (as defined below) or other marketing incentives (“Marketing Incentives”). The Marketing Incentives are given for no exchange of value or other consideration and you therefore have no ownership interests or rights in the Marketing Incentives. For this reason, SpotHero reserves the right to deactivate any Marketing Incentive at any time and for any reason, including, but not limited, to mistake, failure to maintain an updated online account, unauthorized use or suspicion of fraud or abuse of any promotional program or Marketing Incentives. Further, SpotHero reserves the right to terminate or discontinue any promotional program or other program offering Marketing Incentives at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Referral Program:</strong> If you choose to use our referral program (“Referral Program”) to tell a third party (the “Referral”) about the Site in exchange for the opportunity to earn promotional credits for Marketing Services (“Referral Credits”), we will ask you for the Referral’s name, email address and other information. We will automatically send the Referral a one-time email inviting the Referral to visit the Site. We store the Referral’s information for the purpose of sending this email and tracking the success of our referral program. You may only earn Referral Credits up to a value of $250, regardless of any increase in SpotHero fees. Once you have reached the $250 limit (which limit may be increased or decreased at any time in SpotHero’s sole discretion), your online account will no longer be credited for any Referrals. SpotHero reserves the right to deactivate any Referral Credits at any time and for any reason, including, but not limited to, mistake, failure to maintain an updated online account, unauthorized use or suspicion of fraud or abuse of the Referral Program or the Referral Credits in any way. Referral Credits are given for no exchange of value or other consideration, and are strictly promotional vouchers with no monetary value. Further, SpotHero reserves the right to terminate or discontinue the Referral Program at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Reservation Rates:</strong> The rate for a Reservation made on the Site may not be combined with any additional coupons, special offers or other promotion when exiting a parking facility after using the Parking Spot underlying a Reservation. Special discounts do not apply.</p>
<p><strong>Trademarks:</strong> Names, titles, trademarks, service marks, and logos (collectively, the &#8220;Trademarks&#8221;) displayed on the Site are our registered and/or unregistered common law trademarks or those of third parties. Nothing contained in the Site should be construed as granting, by implication or otherwise, any license or right to use any Trademark displayed on the Site without our express written permission or that of the appropriate third party that owns the Trademark. Except as permitted by these Terms and Conditions, any unauthorized use of the Trademarks is prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Millennium Copyright Agent:</strong> For purposes of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&#8220;DMCA&#8221;), we have designated an agent for notices of claimed infringement. If you have any objections governed by the DMCA, please contact the agent listed under the Section entitled &#8220;Contact Information&#8221; below.

<p><strong>How we Use your Personal Information:</strong> In general, we do not share Personal Information that is personally identifiable to you, except where we have your express permission or where required by law. At times, in order to provide products and services or market to customers, we may make certain Personal Information available to strategic partners with whom we work. We may share Personal Information with parties who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys. Except as required pursuant to law, legal process, litigation, or requests from public and governmental authorities, we only share Personal Information to provide or improve our products, services and advertising. We will not share your Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes. In the event of a SpotHero’s reorganization, merger, or sale, we may transfer any and all Personal Information we collect to the relevant third party. As part of the services we provide, we give certain Personal Information to Licensors in order for such Licensors to, among other things, provide their services in connection with facilitating Reservations and for tracking and marketing purposes.</p>
<p><strong>User Submissions:</strong> You agree that any information you provide through the Site will be truthful, accurate and complete. You represent and warrant that you own any information provided through the Site or otherwise have appropriate authority to provide any such information through the Site. All information that you submit to us through the Site shall be deemed and remain our property and we may use, for any purpose, any ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques contained in such information. We have no obligations regarding such information or otherwise specifically agreed to in a separate writing or required by law. You acknowledge and agree that you will not provide any information or material to us or the Site that is defamatory, threatening, obscene, harassing, or otherwise unlawful, or that incorporates the proprietary material of another person or entity.</p>
<p><strong>Law &amp; Order:</strong> We may disclose any of your information (including Personal Information) to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with the law; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of SpotHero or our users; or (d) protect our property rights.</p>
<p><strong>Notice Required:</strong> We are not required to collect, and do not collect Oklahoma, South Dakota and Vermont sales or use tax. Any purchase made is subject to Oklahoma, South Dakota and Vermont use tax unless it is specifically exempt from taxation. The purchase is not exempt merely because it is made over the internet, by catalog or other remote means. The States of Oklahoma, South Dakota and Vermont, require all resident purchasers to report all purchases that were not taxed and pay tax on those purchases. The tax may be reported and paid on the individual income tax return for each state or by filing a consumer use tax return. All use tax forms and corresponding instructions are available on the website of each state’s Department of Revenue: for Oklahoma, www.tax.ok.gov; for South Dakota, www.state.sd.us; and for Vermont, www.state.vt.us/tax, as they may change from time to time.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and Web Beacons:</strong> We may also collect cookies, which are small pieces of information sent to your browser by a website that you visit. We may use cookies to compile and provide aggregate statistics about the Site’s visitors, traffic patterns, and related information to third parties, but such information will not identify you personally. Cookies may help us adjust the content of the Site and provide better service to visitors. You may set your browser to refuse cookies from any website that you visit. If you refuse cookies, you may still gain access to most of the Site, but you may not be able to conduct certain types of transactions. The Site may contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) that may be used to assist in delivering cookies on the Site and allow us to count users who have visited the Site. We may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or our newsletters.</p>
<p><strong>Receiving E-mail:</strong> We may, from time to time, send you e-mail about your User Account, orders or pricing changes. We may also send you e-mail with general information or special offers about products and services that may be of interest to you. In most cases, we will give you an opportunity to accept or decline the receipt of promotional e-mail.</p>
<p><strong>Termination:</strong> We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your use of the Marketing Services and/or your User Account in the event you violate any provision of these Terms and Conditions or if you use SpotHero services in a fraudulent manner.</p>

                                    <p>I love SpotHero. It's the best app out there to help you find parking. So easy to use even my parents use it. I recommend it to all my friends. Anytime I head into the city I use SpotHero. It saves me time and money. Great for concerts and when I commute to work.</p>

                                    <p>Driving into NYC for show, performance, dinner or whatever, is usually an event on some kind of time schedule. These events are made much more enjoyable knowing I already have a parking spot paid for and waiting for me. I appreciate the pictures of the garage entrances that are provided as additional info to alleviate the stress of often driving to a new location. The prices are great and it's an added bonus that once the reservation is made you can change the times. Both times I did that, the price didn't change which was great. Most evening reservations I make (say, to start at 7pm), usually give me until 7am the next day. This app has definitely improved my quality of life regarding parking in NYC and Jersey City NJ.</p>

                                    <p>I travel a bit for work, but never used the app. Decided to do that for a family vacation is San Francisco knowing how parking could be a challenge. Wow!! What a great experience. It takes a minute to set up since I have an google and Facebook ID already plus Apple Pay is set up. It is easy to use. The best thing, it saved us so much money in this trip. Example: parking near Pier 33 for the Alcatraz tour, less than a block away, would normally cost $30 on the weekend was only $19.99. That's after I extended the time which is again very easy to do. Parking near Fisherman's Wharf, normally would have cost us $42 for about 4 hours, turned out only to be $8. I'm going to start using it for work to now. Thanks, SpotHero!! You are my hero!</p>
