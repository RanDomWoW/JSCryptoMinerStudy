<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>A great pleasure can be derived by taking a soothing hot sento bath which temporarily washes away all your depressing work troubles after a hard day at the office. Sento are dying a slow death and rare outlets can be found outside of the cities. Only a few baths can be found around central Tokyo which makes them more unique and appreciated. Sento are usually patronized by local Japanese, and this article will explain the dos and don'ts when visiting a sento to avoid any embarrassment from the naked eyes of the seasoned sento visitors. Make sure to bring the essentials which will be explained.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">First rule in sento is that you will be completely naked once inside the bath. Always have one or two small towels for covering you private parts. It is essentially the most important item and makes other kit secondary. Sento does not provide any shampoo or soap for free, and they come at a price, so be sure to pack some toiletries before heading to one. Avoid bringing along valuable items and do not be afraid of stares if you have tattoo all over your naked body. Local Japanese may very well be more afraid as they associate tattooed bodies with yakuza members. You can bath well in peace if you do not have any.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">There are different sento packages ranging from common baths to Tokyo's super high class sento. Shoes can be stored at the locker facilities. Payment for entrance fee of around 450 yen is paid to and old lady manning the ticket counter or paid to vending machine which will duly spit out tokens for entry.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">Be sure to enter the right bath for the correct gender as separate baths are made for male as well as female respectively. There will be a changing room where you can store your belongings in a locker. Next would be to undress all your clothes and cover your private parts with a small towel. Locker bracelet is worn around you hand for safekeeping. A sliding door separates the baths and the changing room. Cross over and you are well on your way for a tranquil bath.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Baths are large enough for many customers soaking at once. Try to speak softly as possible to keep the atmosphere peaceful and quiet. Shower cubicles can be found beside the baths. A small stool facing a blank wall can be used to wash up. The water is warm and temperature just nice. Baths cannot be used for cleaning yourself. Always ensure you are well washed before soaking in. Toilets can be accessed anytime whenever the need arises.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">You must be completely naked to enter the bath. If you belong to the shy type, cover using your small towel and remove right before entering. Some baths have lightning symbol boards to signify possible experience of electric shocks. The shocks are mild which enables you muscles to contract and provides a soothing feeling. Some baths have higher temperature so be wary of the heat. Test the heat by starting with a hot bath. Relax and ignore the other bathers for a relaxing time. Think of peaceful scenery that you have visited and all your sorrows will be thrown wide out for the moment of extreme peace.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph7">Once you are done with hot bath, enter the cold icy bath to wake you up from slumber land. Good sento comes with mineral bath filled with rich water black in cola color. Once you have done the entire above, step out to clean yourself on the all facing stool, and repeat another round of bath. You have just completed the sento ritual passed down since centuries ago. The final bath should be in the mineral water bath. Immediately put on your pyjamas for an authentic Japanese style sento bath. Warm your inner body with a hot milk and slowly stroll back your comfy bed and get ready for one good slumber.</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>Japan always portrays an image bustling big city for travellers. If one is tired of the hustle and bustle of city crowds, head over to Matsue, located west of Honshu and take the next ferry trip to indulge in slower life pace over at remote <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="http://www.japanvisitor.com/japan-city-guides/oki">Oki Islands</a>.

<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">First in the list if the biggest island among all, which is the Dogo island. It is famous for aging cedar trees, well taken care by locals with zeal. Near the port town named Saigo lays a 2000 years old Yao-sugi huge tree, with branches popping up outside the Tamawakasu Shrine. Another giant tree estimated to be 800 years old lay near the area called Chichi sugi tree, believed to house a deity. Younger cedars (by hundreds of years) can be found in Shizenkaiko forest. Tokage-iwa can be explored. It is more commonly known as the lizard rock due to the appearance of a lizard clawing up the cliff.</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">Nishino shima is home to the breathtaking Kuniga coast. Tourists love hiking up Matengai Cliff to escape the urban cities like Osaka and Tokyo. Options are available for boat tours for an inner view of the rock formations. Yurahime Shrine is also another landmark at Nishino shima. Legend has it that a crowd of squids will gather at the bay to seek forgiveness from a deity for nipping her fingers. Photos of squid crowd can be seen at the lovely shrine. There is a covered ring for sumo wrestlers just outside the shrine. The ring has deep roots for Japanese culture. Tradition has it that wrestlers will fight twice, where there will be one win each. Tournaments are rarely held, maybe once in many years, and luck is needed to predict the timing of the matches if it ever happens.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Chiburi jima is the smallest island. A local slogan is given to the island name that is carefree Chiburi. One must stop by Kawai Jizo spring and admire the bodhisattva statues. The springs made it to the best 100 well preserved water from Shimane. After a refreshing drink, one can take a carefree walk up Sekiheki, also known as the red cliff. The cliff used to be covered in red magma, and its color changes which is dependent on lighting.

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>Tokyo is a global hub for tasty and delicious noodles and the city's population could go on strike and stop functioning without its famous noodles. Tokyo urbanites gobble down incredible amounts of noodles every single day for their entire lives. Some of their favorites include the ever common staple soba as well as udon. Japanese are also very fond of Chinese noodle variant known as ramen. A large variety of noodle shops operate around whole of Japan ranging from tachikui (or more popularly known as standing and eating parlor) bars specializing in sale of specialty noodles  to highly upper class restaurants filled with shining pottery and elaborate gardens. The noodles bars require you to purchase tickets early for a full  meal while in posh restaurants, you can tailor your orders from the ever friendly waiter or waitresses.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">Soba, the traditional Japanese noodle, are thin in texture with brownish colour. Udon, on the other hand, is the complete opposite where it is thick and white. Kanto and Tokyo region is the origin for Soba, where it is closely linked. Udon is said to come from Kansai, regions near Osaka. Nevertheless, restaurants operators with noodle serving on their menu will have both noodle styles. Some of the typical noodle serving styles includes Kake soba or udon, where noodles are served inside a huge round bowl filled with bonito flavor soup base. Mori soba or udon is the complete opposite where noodles are served cold and laid on bamboo mat. It is the perfect noodle serving one can have during warm weather which instantly refreshes the mind and soul.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">A very popular cold noodles liked by many local Japanese is zaru soba. It comes with dried seaweed as the common topping. A side dish accompanying the noodle is a cool broth filled in a small cup and spring onions served with wasabi on a small plate. The best method for eating zaru soba is dipping the noodles into the cool broth after having gently stirring the liquid. It is a mistake to pour the cool broth all around the noodles unless you want to make a mess around the dining table. Towards the final part of the meal, the waitress or server would provide a small glass of sobayu, also known to many as the boiling water used to heat up the noodles, in order for the patron to mix the broth with water. You can then enjoy you glass of broth mixture similar to enjoying a cup of hot tea.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">Not many people are aware of the origins of Ramen. In actual fact, it comes from China, but has gained widespread adoption and recognition in Japan. The most basic form of Ramen is noodle served in a huge bowl of broth. The broth has many flavor variants. Topping can be added to the noodles such as sliced roasted pork meat (chashu), bean sprouts (moyashi) or leeks (negi). Ramen toppings are wide and varied and do not be surprise to see Ramen served with fresh butter corn from Hokkaido or wontons or even Chinese vegetables. Each person has their own favorite taste of Ramen and is loyal devotee to their own ramen flavor, but one thing for sure is that Western instant noodles preparation procedures are poor choice of noodle selection compared to the real delicious ramen.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph5">Eating loudly and making loud sounds when you are in the middle of a meal is looked down upon as rude in Western countries. However, when you are in Japan, be sure to slurp down you noodles as it serves as a cooling tactic for hot noodles and is said to enhance noodle flavor.</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>Hotels types typically fall within the range from budget type hostels to five star luxurious suites. Tokyo has many accommodation variants that are not within the spectrum. Reasons for the birth of these accommodations are due to expensive land prices, small living quarters for families and ultra efficient public transport system. They value convenience above all and also a relaxing hot bath.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">The first of the kind is the capsule hotel. It is essentially a sleeping pod with the size of one futon. The rooms are shaped in capsule sizes just big enough for a good night's rest. It may be out of this world but it is nothing more than a hostel filled stranger sharing beds. Capsule hotels are filled with strangers as well but a little more privacy is afforded. You get to watch TV via headphones and a chance to use the hot bath. It is specially catered for salarymen missing their train late at night. It costs about 4000 yen per night, cheaper compared to one taxi ride home. It has all basic amenities ready such as towels and toothbrushes as well as cotton robes. It may be good to bring along earplug for quietness. Men can go to Green Plaza while ladies can go for Ladies 501.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">Sauna is actually a code for cheap roof over the head to crash over the night. Large public bathhouses that operate 24/7 usually come with relaxation rooms filled with armchairs. Saunas are a common feature around nightlife districts. Rooms are usually filled with salarymen. In women's sauna, it is usually filled with worn out bar hostesses. Saunas are slighty cheaper compared to capsule hotels (around 3000 yen per night) but comes with better bathing options. Some of their specialties include more upscale baths or outdoor baths that draws in the tourists. Traveller can look out for La Qua, a high class public bathhouse.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">Manga kissa used to be a private reading booth for rent, usually a fixed fee where customers can read their favorite books in the booth. Kissa stands for caf&eacute; while manga stands for Japanese comics. People reading were also sleeping in the booth, usually teenagers. Manga kissa operators decided to implement the overnight stay option for the customers rather than shooing them out. It has developed to the extent of manga kissa having shower rooms, blankets and hair drying equipment. Standard rate for manga kissa costs 1500 yen complete with soft drinks but your stay is limited to 8 hours over the night. Gran Cyber Bagus Caf&eacute; is a good choice and has dedicated area for ladies.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Love hotels are hotels based on love themes and they differentiate themselves via elaborate schemes and d&eacute;cor. It is an important social venue for lovebirds who often stay in cramped buildings together with their families. The hotels are equipped with creative d&eacute;cor and could come with karaoke machines and Wii consoles. Patrons have the option for night stay or day rest. You can get the keys to your room via machine dispenser. Hotel Meguro is a recommended love hotel for those looking to experience the stay.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph6">Ryokan have been around since centuries ago and is the most traditional form of temporary lodging facility. It is usually operated by family members of the sole owner. Its rooms are equipped with futons placed neatly on mat floors. The d&eacute;cor is clean and simple and rooms are clean and well maintained. Bathing areas are shared by all guests which is usually in the form of huge bath container. Towels and robes are provided. Dinner and breakfast may be inclusive depending on the stay package. Ryokan gives a feeling of Japanese homestay. It is not very popular among young adults as they pay less attention to tidiness. They are not used to rolling up futons after their sleep early morning. It is getting rare for Ryokans to be found in Tokyo. Sawanoya Ryokan would make a good choice of stay for those wanting to feel the Ryokan experience.</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>50th anniversary for Shinkansen: Japan's first modern bullet train</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">Shinkansen sits in the world modern railway history when it debuted around 1964 as a sleek, modern design bullet train known for its speed and punctuality. <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="http://english.jr-central.co.jp/"><strong>Japanese rail</strong></a> has brought cheers to the transport users for more than 50 years. Tourists can opt for many <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="http://www.japanrailpass.net/en/"><strong>Rail Pass</strong></a> and discount tickets. To commemorate the 50th anniversary for Shinkansen, locals and foreigners alike can enjoy any of the 10 rail adventures around Japan.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">First on the list is revisiting history by paying tribute to the Railway museum. It is located in Omiya, just 25km from Tokyo. The museum houses well preserved train models right from the steam train model to modern day electric rails. Indulge in the train simulator for a true Sinkansen train ride experience. The next step is to look to the future at the Railway Park located near Nagoya, where futuristic train models are displayed. SCMAGLEV is a magnetic levitation tech code name which allows high speed travel up to 580km an hour. The world record shattering train powered by Maglev is on display for all to admire. Trains do sell proper gourmet in the form of bento box. It contains Japanese local delicacies. Fine dining options are also available at the posh dining rail service Tohoku Emotion. You can enjoy your 3 course meals during the travel from Hachinohe right to Kuji.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">Journey spanning over nighttime is equally exhilarating and there are overnight sleeper locomotives on service such as Cassiopeia or Hokutosei service travelling from Sapporo and Tokyo. One can take the famous Twilight Express for a 23 hour ride from Sapporo to Osaka, complete with Japan Sea coast view. Try Seven Stars for travel from Hakata to Kagoshima for an authentic oriental express experience.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Steam trains are still available for ride for those looking for old fashioned travelling mode. Fuyu Shitsugen go, a steam locomotive operates between January till mid-March. It passes through the Kushiro Shitsugen Park, where one can admire the birds and eagles. Moka Railway, another steam locomotive, bring travellers through to the pottery town Mashiko. Trams are still operating in some Japanese cities, which offer travellers the urban atmosphere and neatly lined up building quarters. One of the tram lines is Toden Arakawa. It is one of the last remaining trains having the ding ding sound that runs along Waseda university quarters as well as Minowa bashi. Trams can sometime travel very close to adjacent buildings that it can be reached by arm's length. Funiculars or cable railways are excellent for travelling on mountains. One can try out Hakone Tozen rail which transports travellers from base to Hakone Lakeland resort near Mt Fuji. Cable railway is also a necessary mode of transport that links Japan Alps to Nagano Prefecture. It is none other than the Tateyama Kurobe route. Shinkansen train lines do not pass along scenic country side, except for routes connecting Tokyo and Nagano. One can opt for pretty journey beside Japan Sea on Kitakinki Tango Railroad. You will get the opportunity to view the famous Amanohashidate sandbank.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">Train journey through to the mountainous country allows one to spot cute snow monkeys. One such line which offers such view is the Nagano Electric Railroad Snow Monkey Ride Express. The trains bring you close to hot pools with monkeys bathing alongside. The train trip for the way back bring one to the Obuse town, famous for chestnuts and sake as well as home to woodblock imprint master Mr. Katsushika Hokusai.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph7">Last but not least, one could make some time for admiring the magnificent train station structures. Tokyo Station was restored to its 1914 red building look and is looking as magnificent as ever. Take some time also to visit Nikko station, all made from wooden materials. For a glimpse of modern architecture, head over to Kyoto station and you will gasp at the similarity with works from science fiction manga comics.</div>
