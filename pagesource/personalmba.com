  <h1>The Personal MBA: The Bestselling Business Training Book by Josh Kaufman</h1>

<p>If you want to master the art of business, you don&#39;t need to go to business school. You <em>do</em> need to learn the fundamentals of modern business practice:</p>

<ul>
<li>How to make good business decisions.</li>
<li>How to maximize your personal productivity.</li>
<li>How to manage uncertainty and ambiguity.</li>
<li>How to conduct intelligent experiments to improve your results.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The Personal MBA</em> is designed to help learn the art of business on your own terms. Instead of mortgaging your life to go to business school, it&#39;s possible to dramatically increase your knowledge of business on your own time and with little cost – without setting foot inside a classroom.</p>

<p>With a little time and effort, you can easily learn these skills on your own, without eye-popping tuition and student loans.</p>

<p>Understanding the fundamental principles of business will give you essential tools you can rely on to make good decisions. If you learn these critical concepts, you&#39;ll be in the top 0.01% of the human population when it comes to knowing:</p>

<ul>
<li>How businesses actually work – in practice, not theory.</li>
<li>How to evaluate new business ideas: what <em>really</em> matters, and what doesn&#39;t.</li>
<li>How to start a new business from scratch.</li>
<li>How to improve any existing business, whether it&#39;s a solo venture or a <em>Fortune 500</em> corporation.</li>
<li>How to use business-related skills to accomplish your personal goals.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The Personal MBA</em> explains fundamental, universal business concepts like:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/iron-law-of-the-market/">The Iron Law of the Market</a>: Why every business is limited by the size and quality of the market it attempts to serve – and how to find hungry markets just waiting to be served...</li>
<li><a href="/10-ways-to-evaluate-a-market/">10 Ways to Evaluate a Market</a>: Some business ideas are better than others. Before you quit your job and invest your life savings, you should know how to evaluate new business ideas before you begin. There are ten critical factors you need to consider...</li>
<li><a href="/12-standard-forms-of-value/">The 12 Standard Forms of Value</a>: There&#39;s more to business than products and services. There are actually twelve different ways to create value for your customers. The most successful businesses combine several...</li>
<li><a href="/pricing-uncertainty-principle/">The Pricing Uncertainty Principle</a>: All prices are malleable. Raising your prices is the best way to dramatically increase your business&#39; profitability - if you know how to support the price you&#39;re asking...</li>
<li><a href="/4-methods-to-increase-revenue/">4 Methods to Increase Revenue</a>: There are only four ways for a business to bring in more money. Do you know what they are?</li>
</ul>

<p>True leaders aren&#39;t made by business schools — they make themselves, seeking out the knowledge, skills, and experience they need to succeed.</p>

<p>Read <em>The Personal MBA</em>, and you&#39;ll learn the principles it takes most business professionals a lifetime of trial and error to master.</p>

    <p class="chapter">A Note to the Reader</p>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p class="description"><em>The Personal MBA</em> is an introductory business primer. Its purpose is to give you a clear, comprehensive overview of the most important business concepts in as little time as possible. The vast majority of modern business practice requires little more than common sense, simple arithmetic, and knowledge of a few very important ideas and principles.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="section" class="col-md-5 col-md-offset-1">
    <p class="chapter">Chapter 1</p>
    <h3>Value Creation</h3>
    <p class="description">Every successful business creates something of value. The world is full of opportunities to make other people’s lives better in some way, and your job as a businessperson is to identify things that people don’t have enough of, then find a way to provide them.</p>

    <h3>Marketing</h3>
    <p class="description">Offering value is not enough. If no one knows (or cares) about what you have to offer, it doesn’t matter how much value you create. Without marketing, no business can survive — people who don't know you exist can't purchase what you have to offer, and people who aren’t interested in what you have to offer won't become paying customers.</p>

    <p class="chapter">Chapter 3</p>
    <h3>Sales</h3>
    <p class="description">Every successful business ultimately sells what it has to offer. Having millions of prospects isn't enough if no one ultimately pulls out their wallet and says, "I'll take one." The sales process begins with a prospect and ends with a paying customer. No sale, no business.</p>

    <h3>Analyzing Systems</h3>
    <p class="description">Before you can improve a system, you must understand how well it's currently operating. Unfortunately for us, that’s tricky business: it's not possible to stop the world however long you want while you take careful measurements. Systems must be analyzed as they’re working.</p>

    <p class="description">Creating and improving systems is the heart of successful business practice. The purpose of understanding and analyzing systems is to improve them, which is often tricky: changing systems can often create unintended consequences.</p>
