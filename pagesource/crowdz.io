                                judge or jury (except as otherwise set forth in this Section 23(a) or Section
                                23(d)).</b>  The provisions of this Section 23 shall constitute your and Crowdz’s
                                written agreement to arbitrate Disputes under the Federal Arbitration Act
                                (“<b>Agreement</b>”). Any modification to this Agreement shall be in writing and signed
                                by you and Crowdz. The arbitration will be administered by the American
                                Arbitration Association (“<b>AAA</b>”) and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant
                                to its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related
                                Disputes, available at <a href="http://www.adr.org"

                                800-778-7879. The arbitrator will apply and be bound by this Agreement, apply applicable
                                law and the facts, and issue a reasoned award.</p>
                            <p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must comply with the limitations provision set
                                forth in Section 23(e) and submit the Dispute by utilizing the forms available at <a
                                        href="http://www.adr.org" target="black">http://www.adr.org</a>, and
                                simultaneously sending a copy of the completed form to the following address: 2035
                                Veronica Place, San Jose, CA 95124 [i.e. Registered Agent]. Payment of all filing,
                                administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. Crowdz
                                will reimburse those fees for Disputes totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator
                                determines the Dispute is frivolous. Likewise, Crowdz will not seek attorneys'
                                fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the Dispute is frivolous.
                                The arbitration will be conducted based upon written submissions unless you request
                                and/or the arbitrator determines that a telephone or in-person hearing is necessary. If
                                the arbitrator grants the request or determines an in-person hearing is necessary, the
                                hearing will proceed in Campbell, California, unless the arbitrator determines or we
                                agree that the matter should proceed in the county in which you reside.</p>
                            <p><b>(b) <u>No Class Action Matters</u>. We each agree that we shall bring any Dispute
                                against the other in our respective individual capacities and not as a plaintiff or
                                class member in any purported class, representative proceeding or as an association. In
                                addition, we each agree that Disputes shall be arbitrated only on an individual basis
                                and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. The arbitrator does not have
                                the power to vary these provisions.</b></p>
                            <p><b>(c) <u>Choice of Law and Forum; No Jury Trial</u>.</b> If for any reason a Dispute
                                proceeds in court: (i) you agree that any such Dispute may only be instituted in a state
                                or federal court in Campbell County, California; (ii) you and Crowdz irrevocably
                                consent and submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for
                                resolution of such Disputes; (iii) you and Crowdz agree that the Federal
                                Arbitration Act, the AAA rules, applicable federal law and the laws of the State of
                                California, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, will govern this Agreement
                                and any Disputes; and (iv) you and Crowdz agree to waive any right to a trial by
                                jury.</p>
                            <p><b>(d) <u>Injunctive Relief</u>.</b> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
                                Agreement, either party may bring suit in court seeking an injunction or other equitable
                                relief arising out of or relating to the infringement of a party’s intellectual property
                                or any conduct that violates Section 7 (“Your Conduct”) of the Terms of Use.</p>
                            <p><b>(e) <u>Time Limitations</u>.</b> If either of us wants to assert a Dispute against the
                                other, the party with a Dispute must institute arbitration within one (1) year from the
                                date the Dispute arose. Absent commencing the arbitration within one (1) year from the
                                date the Dispute arose, the Dispute(s) will be forever barred.</p>
                            <p><b>(f) <u>Severability</u>.</b> With the exception of Section 23(b) above, if any part of
                                this Section 23 is ruled to be unenforceable, then the balance of this Section 23 shall
                                remain in full effect and construed and enforced as if the portion ruled unenforceable

                                specified and submitted by you in accordance with Section 3.1; (b) “product/service”
                                that evidences a customer’s purchase of an Offer and contains the terms of, and unique
                                redemption information for, such Offer; (c) “the amount paid,” for the product/service
                                means the amount that a purchaser pays for a product/service; (d) a product/service’s
                                “Promotional Value” is the unpaid portion of the service’s value in excess of the amount
                                paid. (For example, if a purchaser pays $10 for a service with a $25 Full Offer Value,
                                that service’s Promotional Value would be $15); (e) a product/service’s “Full Offer
                                Value” means the full value of the service for which the holder of a certificate will be
                                able to redeem it on or before the Promotional Value Expiration, and is equal to the sum
                                of its Promotional Value plus its amount paid; (f) as applicable, a service’s
                                “Promotional Value Expiration” is the date and time after which a service’s Promotional
                                Value may no longer be used (unless otherwise required by law), and after which time and
                                date, the service may only be redeemed for its amount paid unless refunded in accordance
                                with Crowdz’s Reward Disclaimer and applicable law; (g) “Sales Period(s)” means
                                the date (or dates) and period (or periods) of time an Offer (Crowdbuy or Flashbuy) will
                                be available for purchase as specified in Section 3.1.</p>

                                unauthorized use of your password or Seller Account or any other breach of security
                                related to the App or website. Crowdz is not and will not be liable for any loss

                                on your behalf by authorized Crowdz personnel. In addition to the other rights
                                set forth herein, Crowdz reserves the right to refuse service and/or access to
                                the App or website to you or any other merchant(seller) at any time without notice for
                                any reason. When using your Seller Account and the App or website directly, or
                                indirectly via an authorized agent, to submit and manage other deals, you accept and
                                comply with certain terms and conditions applicable to merchants. Crowdz may
                                offer certain optional features or functionalities within your Seller Account. If you
                                choose to use such features, then you may be required to agree to separate terms that
                                are specific to those features that will be disclosed and available at the time you
                                elect any such option. You represent that you are of legal age to form a binding
                                contract and have full power, capacity and authority to accept these Terms. If you are
                                accepting these Terms on behalf of your employer or another entity, you represent that
                                you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to these Terms. If
                                you do not have the legal authority to bind your entity, please ensure that only an

                            <p>2.2 Merchant Center.</p>
                            <p>The Merchant Center is the section of your Seller Account (in contrast to any individual
                                user account you may maintain) where Merchants may directly, or indirectly through an
                                authorized employee or representative, access information about past Offers that have
                                run through the Program and manage Active Offers. You may use your Seller Account to
                                submit a request to launch a new Offer through a Program and suspend or stop a
                                particular Active Offer (Crowdbuy or Flashbuy). Within the redemption section of your
                                Seller Account, you may also submit product/service redemption data for your Offers and
                                download lists of deal codes. </p>


                            <h4 class="text-blue">Section 3: PROGRAM PARTICIPATION AND YOUR OFFER</h4>
                            <p>3.1 Creation of Offers. </p>
                            <p>By participating in the App, you shall define the conditions of, and may supply the
                                content and images to describe and illustrate, your Offer and its terms, by completing
                                and submitting, or authorizing an agent to complete and submit, an Offer through your
                                Seller Account. Submission of an Offer does not obligate Crowdz to accept the
                                Offer or any of its contents nor to promote the Offer, and is not binding on {{ app_name
                                }} until Crowdz actually promotes the Offer on the App. At the point {{ app_name
                                }} begins to promote your Offer to the public, the Sales Period begins and the Offer
                                becomes an “Active Offer” during such Sales Period(s) unless Crowdz earlier
                                terminates the Offer for any or no reason. You are responsible and liable for all Offer
                                content and terms, and for Crowdz’s or any purchaser’s use or reliance on any of
                                the foregoing. In creating your Offer, you may not: (a) offer to sell any goods or
                                services on terms or in a manner that is prohibited by law from being offered or
                                advertised; (b) include any content that violates or infringes in any way upon the
                                rights of others; or (c) include any material that is unlawful, threatening, abusive,
                                defamatory, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, vulgar, obscene, profane or
                                otherwise objectionable, which encourages conduct that could constitute a criminal
                                offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any Law.</p>
                            <p>3.2 Promotion of Offers. </p>
                            <p>If Crowdz accepts your Offer, Crowdz may promote the Offer using any
                                method and through any medium that Crowdz deems appropriate in its sole
                                discretion, including through e-mail, mobile applications and any other type of
                                electronic interface or distribution channel owned, affiliated, controlled or operated
                                by or through Crowdz. Crowdz further reserves the right, but has no
                                obligation, to promote the Offer through its affiliates and third party business
                                partners from time to time. Crowdz will promote your Offer to Crowdz
                                customers and potential customers based on geographic or other geolocational data, but
                                will determine the customers and potential customers to whom your Offer is actually
                                promoted and made available in its sole discretion. If you indicate specific limits or
                                maximums with respect to the number or type of product/services that may be offered
                                through an Offer, Crowdz will use all commercially reasonable efforts to stop
                                promoting your Offer accordingly.</p>
                            <p>3.3 Distribution of Certificates. </p>
                            <p>Once Crowdz has received payment from a purchaser of the amount paid, {{ app_name
                                }} will authorize for use, and make a certificate available to, the purchaser of your
                                Offer (or will distribute it to a designated transferee on behalf of the purchaser, if
                                any is designated at the time of purchase). The certificate will include any
                                restrictions or limitations on the use of the certificate you have specified in the
                                Offer. Purchasers, or their authorized transferees, may then redeem the Offer by
                                presenting their certificate to you as printed certificate, through their mobile
                                devices, or any other media that Crowdz has adopted for certificate
                                redemption.</p>
                            <p>3.4 Responsibility for Offer and Product/services.
                            <p>You acknowledge that you are the seller of your Offer and the issuer of the
                                product/services. You also are responsible and liable for: (a) the decision to make your
                                Offer available through the Crowdz services; (b) fulfilling your Offer with
                                respect to all product/service holders; (c) supplying and shipping all goods and/or
                                services specified in the Offer; (d) handling any and all returns, exchanges,
                                complaints, disputes, or refunds from customers.</p>
                            <p>3.41 Inventory for Product. </p>
                            <p>The merchant is responsible for all shipments of products to the customer and manages
                                shipment for inventory to and from the customer. Crowdz does not hold the
                                inventory but sellers must manage inventory and sell those items which they current
                                inventory, maintain on in house EOQ levels, or have verifiable open PO’s. Sellers are to
                                operate in a drop ship model, where all product is picked, packaged and shipped from
                                seller (or sellers agents) directly to Crowdz customer ship to address on
                                record. Terms of returns should be spelled out by the seller and the seller deals
                                directly with customer for returns. Once the deals are returned to the seller they
                                authorize Crowdz to adjust payment if needed (debit/credit) ensuring return
                                costs are covered by the seller.</p>
                            <p>3.5 Redemption Obligations. </p>
                            <p>You shall comply with your obligations specified in these Terms, the Offer and other
                                obligations regarding the use of your Seller Account. In addition, when redeeming deals,
                                you shall: (a) honor the deal during the time period specified on, pursuant to the terms
                                of, your Offer, and as required under applicable law(s); (b) handle all customer service
                                in connection with the redemption and use of the deal; (c) honor any certificate
                                presented by an individual, even if that individual was not the purchaser, unless (i)
                                otherwise specified in the Fine Print (as defined below) or otherwise stated prominently
                                on the face of the certificate or, (ii) you reasonably believe that individual obtained
                                the product/service in an unauthorized or illegal manner, in which case you shall
                                immediately contact Crowdz and explain the circumstances; and (d) comply with
                                the terms and conditions stated on the deal without modification and without imposing
                                any restrictions or additional charges or penalties that are not expressly stated on the
                                deal. You shall specify all generally applicable policies (e.g., cancellation policies
                                that apply to all customers), restrictions and contractual arrangements (e.g., liability
                                waivers required for all customers) applicable to the Offer (“Fine Print”) in the Offer,
                                and Crowdz shall have no liability for the nature of your Fine Print or your
                                failure to specify appropriate Fine Print.</p>
                            <p>3.6 Your Third Party Merchants. </p>
                            <p>You may subcontract or delegate portions of your performances required by these Terms
                                with respect to a particular Offer to a third party (each, a “Third Party Merchant”). If
                                you subcontract or delegate to Third Party Merchants with respect to fulfilling such
                                Offer, you will remain solely responsible and liable for (a) all your obligations,
                                including financial obligations, under these Terms and (b) all acts and omissions of
                                your Third Party Merchants. You shall require your Third Party Merchants to comply with
                                all applicable restrictions and obligations imposed on you under these Terms, and you
                                will be solely responsible for your financial and contractual relationship with your
                                Third Party Merchants.</p>
                            <p>3.7 License to Your Content. </p>
                            <p>You hereby grant Crowdz a non-exclusive, worldwide, transferable, irrevocable,
                                perpetual and sub-licensable license to use, copy, distribute, display and perform any
                                trademarks, photographs, graphics, artwork, videos, sound clips, text, and other content
                                or materials that you provide to Crowdz in your Seller Account or otherwise use
                                to describe your Offer (“your Content”) in any and all media or formats in connection
                                with Crowdz’s fulfillment of its rights and obligations under these Terms,
                                including the promotion of Offers and distribution of product/services.</p>
                            <p>3.8 Press Release. </p>
                            <p>Crowdz may, in its sole discretion, include you in any press release regarding
                                the Offers described herein or identify you as a merchant. Press releases will be
                                reviewed by both parties to insure agreeable satisfaction of the desired message by both
                                parties. Crowdz agrees to work with Seller(s) to produce and distribute press
                                releases and in some instances will make requests of sellers to share in the costs
                                associated with producing and distributing such methods of marketing</p>

                            <h4 class="text-blue">Section 4: PAYMENT TERMS</h4>
                            <p>Payment terms governing your Offer are as set forth below, unless you have a separate
                                written agreement with Crowdz expressly modifying the terms of your payment
                                under a particular Program. Payment terms for any non-Program Offers are contained in
                                the applicable contract you entered with Crowdz by accepting the terms and
                                conditions governing your Seller Account or otherwise. Unauthorized Redemptions will not
                                be considered Now Validated Redemptions. Crowdz will pay you the Now Remittance
                                Amount for all then-Now Validated Redemptions (the “Now Aggregate Net Amount”). {{

                                exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration
                                Association (“AAA”) and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable
                                Rules and Procedures established by AAA (“Rules and Procedures”); (b) the arbitration

                                location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and Crowdz; (c) the arbitrator

                                there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative
                                basis; arbitration will decide only your and/or Crowdz’s individual claims; and

                                conflicts with the Rules and Procedures established by AAA, then the balance of this
                                arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with
                                its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not

                                payment method on file, may result in your inability to access and use the Services or
                                Crowdz's termination of this Agreement with you. You are responsible for all
                                activity that occurs under your Account, and you agree to maintain the security and

                                to the general public (whether posted to a public form or otherwise), unless expressly
                                permitted by Crowdz; (iii) may be disabled by Crowdz at any time for any

                                (vi) may expire prior to your use. Crowdz reserves the right to withhold or deduct
                                credits or other features or benefits obtained through the use of Promo Codes by you or
                                any other user in the event that Crowdz determines or believes that the use or
                                redemption of the Promo Code was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or in violation of the
                                applicable Promo Code terms or these Terms.</p>
                            <p>USER PROVIDED CONTENT.</p>

                                your property. However, by providing User Content to Crowdz, you grant
                                Crowdz a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferrable, royalty-free license,

                                rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable
                                law or regulation.</p>

                                information, including a valid credit card.</p>
                            <p>Your account is non-transferrable. You cannot sell, combine, or otherwise share it with

                                23(d)).</b>  The provisions of this Section 23 shall constitute your and Crowdz’s
                                written agreement to arbitrate Disputes under the Federal Arbitration Act
                                (“<b>Agreement</b>”). Any modification to this Agreement shall be in writing and signed
                                by you and Crowdz. The arbitration will be administered by the American
                                Arbitration Association (“<b>AAA</b>”) and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant
                                to its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related

                                law and the facts, and issue a reasoned award.</p>
                            <p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must comply with the limitations provision set
                                forth in Section 23(e) and submit the Dispute by utilizing the forms available at <a

                                administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. Crowdz
                                will reimburse those fees for Disputes totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator
                                determines the Dispute is frivolous. Likewise, Crowdz will not seek attorneys'
                                fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the Dispute is frivolous.
                                The arbitration will be conducted based upon written submissions unless you request
                                and/or the arbitrator determines that a telephone or in-person hearing is necessary. If
                                the arbitrator grants the request or determines an in-person hearing is necessary, the
                                hearing will proceed in Campbell, California, unless the arbitrator determines or we
                                agree that the matter should proceed in the county in which you reside.</p>

                                class member in any purported class, representative proceeding or as an association. In
                                addition, we each agree that Disputes shall be arbitrated only on an individual basis
                                and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. The arbitrator does not have
                                the power to vary these provisions.</b></p>

                                resolution of such Disputes; (iii) you and Crowdz agree that the Federal
                                Arbitration Act, the AAA rules, applicable federal law and the laws of the State of
                                California, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, will govern this Agreement
                                and any Disputes; and (iv) you and Crowdz agree to waive any right to a trial by
                                jury.</p>
                            <p><b>(d) <u>Injunctive Relief</u>.</b> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this

                                relief arising out of or relating to the infringement of a party’s intellectual property
                                or any conduct that violates Section 7 (“Your Conduct”) of the Terms of Use.</p>
                            <p><b>(e) <u>Time Limitations</u>.</b> If either of us wants to assert a Dispute against the

                                date the Dispute arose. Absent commencing the arbitration within one (1) year from the
                                date the Dispute arose, the Dispute(s) will be forever barred.</p>
                            <p><b>(f) <u>Severability</u>.</b> With the exception of Section 23(b) above, if any part of
                                this Section 23 is ruled to be unenforceable, then the balance of this Section 23 shall
                                remain in full effect and construed and enforced as if the portion ruled unenforceable
                                were not contained herein.</p>

                                to offer you through your Seller Account, we may need to change these Terms or our
                                program features from time to time. You should review these Terms regularly. If at any
                                time you do not agree with these Terms, or you do not agree to any modified Terms, then
                                you must immediately stop using your Seller Account. Unless you have agreed otherwise in
                                writing with Crowdz, these Terms govern your use of our services through your

                                individually as a “Party” and collectively as the “Parties”.</p>

                            <h4 class="text-blue">Section 1: DEFINITIONS</h4>
                            <p>1.1 Definitions.
                            <p>
                            <p>(a) “Seller Request” is a request you submit to Crowdz to create a deal, or Offer
                                (Crowdbuy or Flashbuy), to sell your product or service through Crowdz’s {{
                                app_name }} marketplace (“App or Online Site). The terms of the Seller Request are
                                specified and submitted by you in accordance with Section 3.1; (b) “product/service”
                                that evidences a customer’s purchase of an Offer and contains the terms of, and unique
                                redemption information for, such Offer; (c) “the amount paid,” for the product/service
                                means the amount that a purchaser pays for a product/service; (d) a product/service’s
                                “Promotional Value” is the unpaid portion of the service’s value in excess of the amount
                                paid. (For example, if a purchaser pays $10 for a service with a $25 Full Offer Value,
                                that service’s Promotional Value would be $15); (e) a product/service’s “Full Offer
                                Value” means the full value of the service for which the holder of a certificate will be
                                able to redeem it on or before the Promotional Value Expiration, and is equal to the sum
                                of its Promotional Value plus its amount paid; (f) as applicable, a service’s
                                “Promotional Value Expiration” is the date and time after which a service’s Promotional
                                Value may no longer be used (unless otherwise required by law), and after which time and
                                date, the service may only be redeemed for its amount paid unless refunded in accordance
                                with Crowdz’s Reward Disclaimer and applicable law; (g) “Sales Period(s)” means
                                the date (or dates) and period (or periods) of time an Offer (Crowdbuy or Flashbuy) will
                                be available for purchase as specified in Section 3.1.</p>

                            <p>In order to use certain services, you are required to be registered with a special
                                account through Crowdz (your “Seller Account”). Your Seller Account will
                                facilitate your use of various Crowdz services and will allow you to provide and
                                receive current and accurate, contact and other information pertaining to your
                                relationship with Crowdz. You are responsible for maintaining the
                                confidentiality of your Seller Account password, and are responsible for all activities
                                that occur under such account. You agree to immediately notify Crowdz of any
                                unauthorized use of your password or Seller Account or any other breach of security
                                related to the App or website. Crowdz is not and will not be liable for any loss
                                or damage arising from your failure to manage your Seller Account, including without
                                limitation to regularly review the accuracy of your Offers and other information created
                                on your behalf by authorized Crowdz personnel. In addition to the other rights
                                set forth herein, Crowdz reserves the right to refuse service and/or access to
                                the App or website to you or any other merchant(seller) at any time without notice for
                                any reason. When using your Seller Account and the App or website directly, or
                                indirectly via an authorized agent, to submit and manage other deals, you accept and
                                comply with certain terms and conditions applicable to merchants. Crowdz may
                                offer certain optional features or functionalities within your Seller Account. If you
                                choose to use such features, then you may be required to agree to separate terms that
                                are specific to those features that will be disclosed and available at the time you
                                elect any such option. You represent that you are of legal age to form a binding
                                contract and have full power, capacity and authority to accept these Terms. If you are
                                accepting these Terms on behalf of your employer or another entity, you represent that
                                you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to these Terms. If
                                you do not have the legal authority to bind your entity, please ensure that only an
                                authorized person from your organization consents to, and accepts, these Terms.</p>
                            <p>2.2 Merchant Center.</p>
                            <p>The Merchant Center is the section of your Seller Account (in contrast to any individual
                                user account you may maintain) where Merchants may directly, or indirectly through an
                                authorized employee or representative, access information about past Offers that have
                                run through the Program and manage Active Offers. You may use your Seller Account to
                                submit a request to launch a new Offer through a Program and suspend or stop a
                                particular Active Offer (Crowdbuy or Flashbuy). Within the redemption section of your
                                Seller Account, you may also submit product/service redemption data for your Offers and
                                download lists of deal codes. </p>


                            <h4 class="text-blue">Section 3: PROGRAM PARTICIPATION AND YOUR OFFER</h4>
                            <p>3.1 Creation of Offers. </p>
                            <p>By participating in the App, you shall define the conditions of, and may supply the
                                content and images to describe and illustrate, your Offer and its terms, by completing
                                and submitting, or authorizing an agent to complete and submit, an Offer through your
                                Seller Account. Submission of an Offer does not obligate Crowdz to accept the
                                Offer or any of its contents nor to promote the Offer, and is not binding on {{ app_name
                                }} until Crowdz actually promotes the Offer on the App. At the point {{ app_name
                                }} begins to promote your Offer to the public, the Sales Period begins and the Offer
                                becomes an “Active Offer” during such Sales Period(s) unless Crowdz earlier
                                terminates the Offer for any or no reason. You are responsible and liable for all Offer
                                content and terms, and for Crowdz’s or any purchaser’s use or reliance on any of
                                the foregoing. In creating your Offer, you may not: (a) offer to sell any goods or
                                services on terms or in a manner that is prohibited by law from being offered or
                                advertised; (b) include any content that violates or infringes in any way upon the
                                rights of others; or (c) include any material that is unlawful, threatening, abusive,
                                defamatory, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, vulgar, obscene, profane or
                                otherwise objectionable, which encourages conduct that could constitute a criminal
                                offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any Law.</p>
                            <p>3.2 Promotion of Offers. </p>
                            <p>If Crowdz accepts your Offer, Crowdz may promote the Offer using any
                                method and through any medium that Crowdz deems appropriate in its sole
                                discretion, including through e-mail, mobile applications and any other type of
                                electronic interface or distribution channel owned, affiliated, controlled or operated
                                by or through Crowdz. Crowdz further reserves the right, but has no
                                obligation, to promote the Offer through its affiliates and third party business
                                partners from time to time. Crowdz will promote your Offer to Crowdz
                                customers and potential customers based on geographic or other geolocational data, but
                                will determine the customers and potential customers to whom your Offer is actually
                                promoted and made available in its sole discretion. If you indicate specific limits or
                                maximums with respect to the number or type of product/services that may be offered
                                through an Offer, Crowdz will use all commercially reasonable efforts to stop
                                promoting your Offer accordingly.</p>
                            <p>3.3 Distribution of Certificates. </p>
                            <p>Once Crowdz has received payment from a purchaser of the amount paid, {{ app_name

                                any is designated at the time of purchase). The certificate will include any
                                restrictions or limitations on the use of the certificate you have specified in the

                            <p>3.4 Responsibility for Offer and Product/services.
                            <p>You acknowledge that you are the seller of your Offer and the issuer of the
                                product/services. You also are responsible and liable for: (a) the decision to make your
                                Offer available through the Crowdz services; (b) fulfilling your Offer with
                                respect to all product/service holders; (c) supplying and shipping all goods and/or
                                services specified in the Offer; (d) handling any and all returns, exchanges,
                                complaints, disputes, or refunds from customers.</p>
                            <p>3.41 Inventory for Product. </p>
                            <p>The merchant is responsible for all shipments of products to the customer and manages
                                shipment for inventory to and from the customer. Crowdz does not hold the
                                inventory but sellers must manage inventory and sell those items which they current
                                inventory, maintain on in house EOQ levels, or have verifiable open PO’s. Sellers are to
                                operate in a drop ship model, where all product is picked, packaged and shipped from
                                seller (or sellers agents) directly to Crowdz customer ship to address on
                                record. Terms of returns should be spelled out by the seller and the seller deals
                                directly with customer for returns. Once the deals are returned to the seller they
                                authorize Crowdz to adjust payment if needed (debit/credit) ensuring return
                                costs are covered by the seller.</p>
                            <p>3.5 Redemption Obligations. </p>
                            <p>You shall comply with your obligations specified in these Terms, the Offer and other
                                obligations regarding the use of your Seller Account. In addition, when redeeming deals,
                                you shall: (a) honor the deal during the time period specified on, pursuant to the terms
                                of, your Offer, and as required under applicable law(s); (b) handle all customer service
                                in connection with the redemption and use of the deal; (c) honor any certificate
                                presented by an individual, even if that individual was not the purchaser, unless (i)
                                otherwise specified in the Fine Print (as defined below) or otherwise stated prominently
                                on the face of the certificate or, (ii) you reasonably believe that individual obtained
                                the product/service in an unauthorized or illegal manner, in which case you shall
                                immediately contact Crowdz and explain the circumstances; and (d) comply with
                                the terms and conditions stated on the deal without modification and without imposing
                                any restrictions or additional charges or penalties that are not expressly stated on the
                                deal. You shall specify all generally applicable policies (e.g., cancellation policies
                                that apply to all customers), restrictions and contractual arrangements (e.g., liability
                                waivers required for all customers) applicable to the Offer (“Fine Print”) in the Offer,
                                and Crowdz shall have no liability for the nature of your Fine Print or your
                                failure to specify appropriate Fine Print.</p>
                            <p>3.6 Your Third Party Merchants. </p>
                            <p>You may subcontract or delegate portions of your performances required by these Terms
                                with respect to a particular Offer to a third party (each, a “Third Party Merchant”). If
                                you subcontract or delegate to Third Party Merchants with respect to fulfilling such
                                Offer, you will remain solely responsible and liable for (a) all your obligations,
                                including financial obligations, under these Terms and (b) all acts and omissions of
                                your Third Party Merchants. You shall require your Third Party Merchants to comply with
                                all applicable restrictions and obligations imposed on you under these Terms, and you
                                will be solely responsible for your financial and contractual relationship with your
                                Third Party Merchants.</p>
                            <p>3.7 License to Your Content. </p>
                            <p>You hereby grant Crowdz a non-exclusive, worldwide, transferable, irrevocable,

                                to describe your Offer (“your Content”) in any and all media or formats in connection
                                with Crowdz’s fulfillment of its rights and obligations under these Terms,
                                including the promotion of Offers and distribution of product/services.</p>
                            <p>3.8 Press Release. </p>
                            <p>Crowdz may, in its sole discretion, include you in any press release regarding
                                the Offers described herein or identify you as a merchant. Press releases will be
                                reviewed by both parties to insure agreeable satisfaction of the desired message by both
                                parties. Crowdz agrees to work with Seller(s) to produce and distribute press
                                releases and in some instances will make requests of sellers to share in the costs
                                associated with producing and distributing such methods of marketing</p>

                            <h4 class="text-blue">Section 4: PAYMENT TERMS</h4>
                            <p>Payment terms governing your Offer are as set forth below, unless you have a separate
                                written agreement with Crowdz expressly modifying the terms of your payment
                                under a particular Program. Payment terms for any non-Program Offers are contained in

                                conditions governing your Seller Account or otherwise. Unauthorized Redemptions will not
                                be considered Now Validated Redemptions. Crowdz will pay you the Now Remittance
                                Amount for all then-Now Validated Redemptions (the “Now Aggregate Net Amount”). {{

                                following the applicable deals’ promotional expiration, and will arrange for payment of

                                <li>Sellers pay $0.99 per buyer transaction and 5% of the value (revenue value) of each
                                    completed and paid transaction. These fees will be deducted automatically prior to
                                    Seller receiving payment for the goods and or services sold via the Crowdz
                                    APP or website. For Crowd Buys, Sellers are paid at the lowest price once the

                                and at your own expense. You shall not settle any Claim for which you are to be
                                indemnified hereunder without Crowdz’s prior written consent, which consent
                                shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.</p>

                            <p>12.1 Binding Arbitration. </p>
                            <p>The Parties hereby agree that (a) these Terms and all disputes, controversies, or claims
                                arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Offer, or the Offer shall be resolved
                                exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration
                                Association (“AAA”) and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable
                                Rules and Procedures established by AAA (“Rules and Procedures”); (b) the arbitration
                                shall be held at a location determined by AAA pursuant to the Rules and Procedures
                                (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you), or at such other
                                location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and Crowdz; (c) the arbitrator
                                shall apply California Law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable
                                statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (d)
                                there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative
                                basis; arbitration will decide only your and/or Crowdz’s individual claims; and
                                the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who
                                may be similarly situated; (e) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the
                                costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, {{
                                app_name }} will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the
                                arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being
                                cost-prohibitive; and (f) with the exception of subpart (d) above, if any part of this
                                arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise
                                conflicts with the Rules and Procedures established by AAA, then the balance of this
                                arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with
                                its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not
                                contained herein. If, however, subpart (d) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or
                                illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and
                                neither you nor Crowdz shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute. For more

                            <p>Agora Intelligence, Inc. has implemented an information security program that contains
                                administrative, technical and physical controls that are designed to reasonably
                                safeguard Personal Information. For example, we use industry-standard encryption
                                technology to secure Financial Account Information. No method of transmission over the
                                Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot
                                guarantee its absolute security. </p>
