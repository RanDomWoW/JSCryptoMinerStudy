    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>GIOVANNI DI PAOLO (1399-1482): SIENESE SPIRITUAL PAINTER</strong><br>
    The Siena painter Giovanni di Paolo probably received his training from the followers of Taddeo di Bartolo and Gregorio di Cecco. He is known to have delivered his first commissions in 1420 and 1423 but these are now lost, and his earliest works to survive are parts of the Pecci Polyptych (1426). These include the central panel (&quot;The Virgin and Angels&quot;), two side-panels (&quot;St Dominic and St John the Baptist&quot;) and the altar-panels (&quot;The Raising of Lazarus&quot;; &quot;The Ascent to Calvary&quot;; &quot;The Deposition&quot;; &quot;The Entombment&quot;; and &quot;The Crucifixion&quot;). The quick incisive style of &quot;Christ Suffering and Triumphant&quot;, expresses with particular intensity Giovanni's moving and exalted vision. At heart he was a medievalist who turned his back on the principles of the Renaissance to pursue an ideal of lofty, suffering spirituality, mingled with frenzied unreality and an archaic religiosity. In the surviving Branchini Panel (&quot;The Virgin and Child&quot; 1427) the influence of Gentile da Fabriano can be seen in certain decorative details, although it does not affect the coherence of the work as a whole. The innovations in Sienese art of this period, introduced largely by Sassetta, affected Giovanni di Paolo's later works only formally, as may be seen in the surviving panels of the Fondi Predella, dated 1436 (&quot;The Crucifixion&quot;; &quot;The Presentation in the Temple&quot;; &quot;The Flight into Egypt&quot;; &quot;The Adoration of the Magi&quot;). Sassetta's ideas are here transformed into visions of Gothic unreality corresponding to Ambrogio Lorenzetti's rediscovery of landscape, as shown in the astonishing &quot;Flight into Egypt&quot;. The Pizzicaiuoli Polyptych (1447-9), &quot;The Presentation in the Temple&quot;, and the &quot;Scenes from the Life of St Catherine of Siena&quot; provide further evidence of Giovanni's capacity for translating the new ideas of Vecchietta or Pietro di Giovanni d'Ambrogio, for example, into archaic language. Giovanni achieved an unsurpassed level of dramatic expressiveness in various versions of the Crucifixion, and in the famous and masterly &quot;Scenes from the Life of St John the Baptist&quot;, in which the fervour of his ascetic vision is exalted to a point where it resembles the Gothic stylization of Lorenzo Monaco in its most visionary form. Giovanni di Paolo's documented output is considerable, and includes many works that once formed part of polyptychs. Among the more remarkable are, in chronological order: &quot;Agony in the Garden&quot; and &quot;The Deposition&quot; (Vatican Museums), both of which were painted before 1440; &quot;The Madonna of Humility&quot; (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston); &quot;The Expulsion from Paradise&quot; (Metropolitan Museum, New York); the 1445 Uffizi Polyptych; &quot;The Adoration of the Magi&quot; (Cleveland Museum); &quot;The Presentation in the Temple&quot; (Metropolitan Museum); &quot;Calvary&quot;, (Gemaldegalerie, Berlin), of which certain elements were inspired by Gentile da Fabriano; and the &quot;St Jerome&quot; (Opera del Duomo, Siena). His final works, including the St Sylvester Polyptych (1475) at Staggia (Pinacoteca Nazionale, Siena), display an unmistakable decline in style. Among the followers of this inimitable and rather solitary painter, the most notable was undoubtedly the more independent Pellegrino di Mariano.
