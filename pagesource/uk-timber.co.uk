Completed projects from our Midlands based sawmills include many Grand Designs, Historic Stately Homes and smaller home builds the length and breadth of the UK. Structural beams are cut on site from both Oak and Douglas Fir, both materials have their own specific traits, please call to discuss which will suit your requirements the best. Our sawyers have decades of experience between them and we can accommodate almost any request in a timely manner and with an eye for both the quality of the material that is being used and the finished product. Maximum length currently available to order from our huge tree stock is 12.5 metres, another unique offering from UK Timber. Please use the calculators to price your own cutting list or take a look at our stock sizes to see if they can be made to work for your specific project. Most UK based companies actually import the oak beams that they sell from European countries, primarily France then ship them to the UK according to specified cutting lists and tranship to the customer. At UK Timber Ltd, we bypass that whole process, cutting to order in the UK on site and delivering with our own dedicated vehicles, all of which are fitted with cranes for ease of offloading. The purchase of oak beams and oak frames is not cheap. Please feel reassured that our expertise and attention to detail coupled with an outstanding, subsidised nationwide delivery service has your every requirement covered.

Different Grades of UK Timber Oak Green Structural Oak A fresh cut oak that has been clear-cut in the last 3 - 6 months, it is of high moisture content and is prone to shrinkage and movement during the drying process. Also known as falling boards, these oaks are used for all sorts of external and landscaping purposes. Air Dried Structural Oak This oak dries relatively more slowly compared with other types. Machine-sawn and straight, it can easily be cut into different precise dimensions. Sometimes displaying surface checking, splits, a little sap and a few historic bore holes, these flaws will doubtless add a little character to the finished project. QP1 Grade Beams These oak beams have a minimum of 3 straight edges with tolerance of a small amount of wane to one edge. They are better utilised in the construction industry and for property renovations. Fresh Sawn Vs Air-Dried UK Timber offers both air dried &nbsp;and&nbsp;fresh sawn oak beams. Here is a comparison of these options: Fresh Sawn VS Air-dried Adaptable for many various projects Used where some movement and shrinkage is permitted It dries slowly and adjusts naturally Used for framing and restoration Suitable for more sensitive situations The beams are dried in square sections for 1-4 years Appropriate for projects that require an aged aesthetic"> Oak Beams and Boards </a><ul><li > <a href="https://www.uk-timber.co.uk/58-structural-green-oak-beams" title="Our numerous sawmills cut to standard and custom sizes in green English and French oak (quercus robur).
