I haven't posted much here in a long time because I've been busily building other sites. But I am pleased to announce that my music blog <a href="http://music.linear1.org/">musical thoughts</a> is open for your reading and listening enjoyment.<p>I'm making use of YouTube and its API to embed videos, making it a multimedia experience that I hope you will enjoy.

Wow this is long overdue. But I have opened the door to my new <a href="http://case-mods.linear1.org/">case modding</a> site. It was a major effort, but it clears the way for the next stage, in which this old grey site is going bye-bye. But don't be sad because the new stuff rocks in so many ways it's not even funny.<p><ul><br><li>new modding articles</li><br><li>RSS feeds for each topic site</li><br><li>shorter, faster-loading pages</li><br><li> integration with the new forum</li><br><li>bigger images, with captions</li><br><li>links to great modding sites</li><br><li>excellent new <a href="http://forums.linear1.org/">discussion forum</a></li><br><li>new modding portal coming very very soon</li><br><li>and a couple more surprises in the pipeline</li><br></ul>

For those of you who liked the <a href="/ckts/led.php">LED Calculator</a> but wished it could handle multiple LEDs, I'm pleased to announce the <a href="http://led.linear1.org/led.wiz">LED series/parallel array wizard</a>. Let the wizard handle the design work if you're building an LED array.<p>The wizard is part of <a href="http://led.linear1.org/">LED Center</a>, my new site on the topic of LEDs. Stop in and then let me know what you think in the <a href="http://forums.linear1.org/">discussion forums</a>.

This is the latest milestone in what will be a complete site-wide makeover. I've been threatening to redo this site for years, but now that the process is officially under way, I'm pleased to announce that my <a href="http://forums.linear1.org/">discussion board</a> is open for business. You do have to register to post, but not for just looking around.<br>

Okay, for several weeks I've been working on this project, and now I'm ready to open the doors. I've created a new site that focuses entirely on LEDs, with information for hobbyists, and information for those interested in the field of solid state lighting (lighting your home or business with LEDs) who may not be lighting designers or physicists. In other words, a plain-talk guide to LED lighting and using LEDs for projects.<p>The <a href="http://led.linear1.org/">LED center</a> is my attempt at making available the crucial information necessary to light up LEDs. Please check it out and <a href="/contact/">let me know what you think</a>.

Take a retired editor who owns a pet store, give him a digital camera and a copy of FrontPage, turn him loose, and what do you get? You get the <a href="http://aqualandpetsplus.com/" target="_blank">Aqualand Pets Plus web site</a> featuring detailed info on all kinds of pets and critters, with several thousand photos. Go look around and see if you don't learn something about <a href="http://aqualandpetsplus.com/Tetras,%20Distochodus.htm" target="_blank">Distichodus</a> or <a href="http://aqualandpetsplus.com/Cichlid,%20Uaru.htm" target="_blank">Uarus</a>.
