            <li>Again, this contest is volunteer based and 100% optional! It is not required to participate if you do not wish to.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>"Can I enter the contest even if I haven’t purchased the Science Based Six Pack program?"</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you would like to take part in this contest, you must be a member of the Science Based Six Pack course. That means you will have to purchase the course through this page OR already be an existing member (purchased the program on a previous date).</li>
            <li>The requirements for becoming an official contestant of the 30-Day Fasting Transformation include being a member of the Science Based Six Pack course and also, submitting your before picture during the contest enrollment period. You will not qualify for a free supplement for entering the contest unless you are a current member of the Science Based Six Pack program. Therefore if you currently are not a member, you can simply sign up today through this page and you will be granted immediate lifetime access to the course and be eligible for a free supplement.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>"What are the official dates of the contest?"</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The open enrollment for the 30-day challenge is from 12/29/2017 to 1/31/2018. After January 31st, the 30-day contest period will officially begin.</li>
            <li>The contest will officially be over on 3/2/2018 (30 days from the initial starting period). Thomas will release a video to announce the top 10 contestants and the viewers will vote to determine the top 3 winners.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>"How do I start my transformation with the Science Based Six Pack course?"</p>
        <ul>
            <li>After you purchase the course, you will simply log into the membersite on your desktop, laptop or mobile device (using the credentials that will be provided to you after signing up) and begin your transformation by watching the video tutorials within the program. These videos will give you a foundation of knowledge behind the best practices, tips and supplements to use when following an intermittent fasting based plan.</li>
            <li>Once you’ve watched the video tutorials, you may begin your 30-day challenge by selecting the ‘Base Track’ or the ‘Fast Track’ diet plans. The ‘Base Track’ is suitable for those who have never followed an eating regime before as it offers more room for flexibility and the ‘Fast Track’ is more suitable for those who have experience with following a regimented eating plan as it offers a macro-specific meal plan to follow. If experiencing fast, efficient results is your main goal, we recommend you choosing the ‘Fast Track’ diet plan.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>"What should I do after I’ve completed the 30-day challenge?"</p>
        <ul>
            <li>After you’ve completed the first 30 days of the program, move into phase 2 of the program. The entire course is a 3-phase (90 day) plan, so after you’ve finished the initial 30 day phase, you can continue experiencing results by finishing the remaining two phases of the course as laid out within the program.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>"How do I submit my “before” and “after” progress pictures for the transformation contest?"</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It’s easy! Simply send an email with your before photo attached to support@sixpackabs.com and type “30 day challenge” in the subject line. Your before picture should depict your current appearance and must be submitted during the enrollment period in order to be acknowledged as a valid participant in the contest. The enrollment period starts on 12/29/2017 and ends on 1/31/2018.</li>
            <li>All “after” pictures must be submitted no later than March 2nd, 2018 in order to be reviewed as a valid contestant in the transformation contest.</li>
            <li>If you have questions regarding how to properly take “before” and “after” pictures for the contest, please send an email to support@sixpackabs.com and a representative will provide you with more details.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>"After I enter the contest, how do I redeem my free supplement of choice?"</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Remember, in order to enter the contest you must purchase the Science Based Sixpack course and email in your "before" picture to support@sixpackabs.com before the enrollment period ends.

The vast majority read or skim through it once, then do not implement the program or take any recommended action based. The results of our exercise methodology are intangible, and not measured in fat loss, muscle gain, abdominal definition, or other positive results of any kind. And even when consumers implement our product in full, more often than not they do not report increases in fat loss, muscle gain, abdominal definition, or other positive results of any kind. Reports of specific fat loss, muscle gain, abdominal definition, or any positive results of any kind should therefore be understood as the exception rather than the rule. Consumers who use our products can generally expect not to see any increase in fat loss, muscle gain, abdominal definition, or positive results of any kind. It is entirely possible you will gain fat, lose muscle, lose abdominal definition, and experience other negative outcomes as a result of the advice contained in our products.</p>

If we have disclosed typical results based on information provided to us by a manufacturer or other reputable third party source, you should presume that the typical results as stated are more reliable than the testimonials and other examples found at sixpackshortcuts.com and/or from SPS. However, you should always perform due diligence and not take such results at face value. We are not responsible for any errors or omissions in typical results information supplied to us by manufacturers or other reputable third parties. If a product or service is new, you understand that it may not have been available for purchase long enough to provide an accurate results history. Again, it is possible that even with perfect use of the program, you will not achieve the results described in testimonials. They are meant to be a showcase of the best results the program has produced, and should not be taken as the results a typical user will get.</p>

<span class="more-effective-sub">I Know What You Must Be Thinking&#133;</span></div>
</div>
<section id="qa"><div class="container">

    <p class="qa-q">“This is probably just another one of those fad diets, isn’t it?”</p>
    <ul class="qa-a">
        <li><a href="#disclaimer2">*</a>Not at all! In fact, the practice of intermittent fasting has been used for centuries for its wide variety of health benefits such as general weight management, cellular repair, enhanced brain function, immunity, and even to increase one’s lifespan (<a href="#references">1</a>, <a href="#references">2</a>, <a href="#references">3</a>, <a href="#references">4</a>, <a href="#references">5</a>, <a href="#references">6</a>).</li>
        <li><a href="#disclaimer2">*</a>Intermittent fasting is popular for a reason, and that's because it's not just another diet, it's a healthy lifestyle change that literally transforms the mechanisms within your body that allow you to become a self-sufficient fat burner.</li>
        <li><a href="#disclaimer2">*</a>According to a 2014 review of the scientific literature, intermittent fasting can cause weight loss of 3-8% over 3-24 weeks (<a href="#references">7</a>). The study showed that individuals also lost 4-7% of their waist circumference, which indicates that they lost lots of belly fat, the harmful fat in the abdominal cavity that causes disease.</li>
        <li>*This science based plan is particularly unique because it’s a designed as a complete lifestyle plan - meaning it also incorporates an exercise course to compliment the benefits of following this pattern of eating - making it truly unique to any other typical “fat loss diet” available.</li>
    </ul>
<hr class="hr2">
    <p class="qa-q">“I’ve tried so many other diets before&#133; Will this really work for me and my busy schedule?”</p>
    <ul class="qa-a">
        <li><a href="#disclaimer2">*</a>It’s worked for many men like you before! So many men turn to intermittent fasting because of the simplicity it brings to their daily lives… No more hassling with breakfast, wasting hours in the kitchen preparing meals in advance, or having to eat every 2-3 hours.</li>
        <li><a href="#disclaimer2">*</a>Upon starting, many find themselves more energetic, more focused and productive during the day - Plus, hunger cravings are diminished meaning far less food distractions are experienced.</li>
        <li><a href="#disclaimer2">*</a>And since your scheduled eating periods are later in the day, that means you get to enjoy eating the foods you love when you have the opportunity to relax after a long, busy day.</li>
    </ul>
<hr class="hr2">
    <p class="qa-q">“So what is intermittent fasting, exactly?”</p>
    <ul class="qa-a">
        <li><a href="#disclaimer2">*</a>The first thing that you need to know is that intermittent fasting is NOT a diet. You still eat your normal amount of food, you just eat it in a smaller time frame, referred to as your “eating period”.</li>
        <li><a href="#disclaimer2">*</a>It is simply a plan telling you when you can eat and when you cannot eat. Since you spend more time fasting than you do eating, it gives your body a chance to tap into its stored fat for fuel.</li>
        <li><a href="#disclaimer2">*</a>Based on the numerous benefits you’re about to discover, intermittent fasting  is really meant for anyone who is serious about improving their health and losing weight without overhauling their diet… or making any drastic behavior changes. Technically, you don’t need to change anything about your diet to benefit from intermittent fasting , which makes it very appealing to many men.</li>
    </ul>
<hr class="hr2">
    <p class="qa-q">“What’s the difference between the Science Based Sixpack Intermittent Fasting Course versus the other Intermittent Fasting plans?”</p>
    <ul class="qa-a">
        <li><a href="#disclaimer2">*</a>Firstly, unlike most intermittent fasting  programs which don’t provide guidelines for what to eat during your eating periods, I’ve included for you my personal “Fast Break Strategy” - a simple method of breaking your fast with specific nutrients that research has shown can extend the fat-burning effects of your fast - well into your eating period! So that way you can enjoy the foods you really love while being able to reach your goals.</li>
        <li><a href="#disclaimer2">*</a>I’ve also provided two plans - a ‘Base Track’ plan which is a more flexible intermittent fasting  schedule that is perfect for men who are new to following a nutrition plan. Additionally, I’ve included my ‘Fast Track’ plan, which is my personal intermittent fasting  plan that I used to transform my own body - it’s comes with a macronutrient-based meal plan and over a dozen different “Fast Break Recipes” including convenient mini-meal options, super satisfying blow out meals and even desserts!</li>
        <li><a href="#disclaimer2">*</a>Finally, I’ve incorporated a uniquely specialized exercise regimen that compliments the effects of my intermittent fasting  eating course and allows you to dig even deeper into your fat stores to overhaul your weight loss goals even faster.</li>
    </ul>
<hr class="hr2">
    <p class="qa-q">“Isn’t going long periods of time without eating bad for me? Won’t I burn muscle?”</p>
    <ul class="qa-a">
        <li><a href="#disclaimer2">*</a>As far back as the 1930s, scientists have been exploring the many benefits of a “fasted” lifestyle approach. During that time, one American scientist found that significantly reducing calories for set periods of time promoted longer, healthier lifespans while reducing the risk of common diseases (<a href="#references">8</a>).</li>
        <li><a href="#disclaimer2">*</a>Many researchers conclude that fasting may also increase the body’s responsiveness to your fat burning hormone, which regulates blood sugar and helps control hunger - both of which contribute to enhancing health and quality of life (<a href="#references">9</a>).</li>
        <li><a href="#disclaimer2">*</a>As for your muscle - several studies on intermittent fasting  have also shown that a certain protein-synthesis boosting hormone dramatically increases as a direct result from fasting. Having higher levels of this hormone helps with muscle building. Bigger muscles means more strength and more endurance and as you can tell, these are characteristics that every guy looking to put on lean size would cherish.</li>
    </ul>
<hr class="hr2">
    <p class="qa-q">“But won’t going long periods of time without eating make me feel tired? I don’t want to have low energy or have difficulty focusing&#133;”</p>
    <ul class="qa-a">
        <li><a href="#disclaimer2">*</a>Fatigue, brain fog, and inability to stay on task are common symptoms that people experience daily which are in fact made worse by fluctuating your blood sugar levels constantly throughout the day (eating every 2-3 hours is largely the culprit).</li>
        <li><a href="#disclaimer2">*</a>However, intermittent fasting may hold the answer for you. Studies show that intermittent fasting  actually releases a hormone called Noradrenaline - or better known as the “fight or flight” hormone. This hormone keeps the body and mind in a heightened state of alertness, sharpens your focus and contributes to feeling higher levels of energy during the day. Lower fat burning hormone levels and increased amounts of noradrenaline together have been shown to increase the breakdown of body fat and facilitate its use for energy.</li>
    </ul>
<hr class="hr2">
    <p class="qa-q">“How am I going to fight hunger cravings? What if I fall off the wagon?”</p>
    <ul class="qa-a">
        <li><a href="#disclaimer2">*</a>Good news: The answer is no. While the idea of “fasting” may make you think of “starving”, intermittent fasting is more about cutting way back on calories for short time periods. Doing so will affect your hunger and cravings over time in a positive way.</li>
        <li><a href="#disclaimer2">*</a>The idea: As your body adjusts, you become satisfied more easily with smaller portions because your stomach capacity shrinks - along with your appetite.</li>
        <li><a href="#disclaimer2">*</a>Falling off the wagon tends to not be a concern when following an intermittent fasting  program because technically, you don’t need to change anything about your diet to benefit from intermittent fasting &#133; Meaning you still can enjoy the foods you love - just in a smaller window of time. Which makes it very appealing to many people.</li>
    </ul>
<hr class="hr2">
    <p class="qa-q">“It sounds like this program is asking me to break all of the most important diet rules I’ve ever learned, is that wise?”</p>
    <ul class="qa-a">
        <li><a href="#disclaimer2">*</a>Well, ask yourself this question: Have the diets or weight loss advice you tried to follow in the past worked? If you didn’t experience any positive results, then that’s your body’s way of telling you that you need to try a different approach.</li>

    <h2 class="top-banner-subheadline3" style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Here Are The Top 4 So-Called Most Important Fat Loss Diet Rules&#133; <strong>And Why You Need To BREAK Them</strong></h2>
    <p class="rules-hdr"><strong>RULE #1:</strong> “Never eat late at night.”</p>
    <item class="rules-bdy">
        <p>Now, if you’ve ever tried to lose weight before, I’m sure you’ve heard that eating at night will make you gain weight&#133;</p>
        <p>The reason being that if you eat before bedtime, you won’t be actively burning calories while you sleep, therefore you’ll just store the food as body fat&#133; Sound familiar?</p>
        <p>Well I hate to break it to you… But that’s not always true.<p>
        <p>You see, if you are constantly eating during the day and pig out at night time, well then yes, logically you would pack on fat.</p>
        <p>But, by keeping your fat burning hormone levels minimized, you’ll give your body a chance to use energy it already has stored - Meaning you’ll have the freedom to chow down on your favorite foods without the guilt of eating late&#133;</p>
        <p>In fact, if you time your eating periods just right&#133; You can actually improve the results you will see by eating this late.</p>
    </item>
<hr class="hr3">
    <p class="rules-hdr"><strong>RULE #2:</strong> “Don’t skip breakfast.”</p>
    <item class="rules-bdy">
        <p>If you are a guy who breaks this rule because you don’t have time to prepare a morning meal or perhaps you just don’t have much of an appetite when you wake up - Don’t sweat it!</p>
        <p>Because here’s the real truth about the so-called ‘most important meal of the day&#133;</p>
        <p>During your nightly sleep cycle, your body goes from a ‘fed state’ to a ‘fasted state’ - where it’s no longer breaking down or absorbing nutrients from the food you ate.<p>
        <p>That means your body will naturally begin tapping into stored energy (body fat) for fuel.</p>
        <p>However, when you decide to eat first thing in the morning, you’re literally breaking your fast (break-fast), and instead, triggering your fat burning hormone levels to rise.</p>
        <p>Your fat burning hormone is the hormone responsible for fat storage.</p>
        <p>So, if we ramp up our fat burning hormone levels first thing in the morning, we are sending our bodies right into fat storing mode.</p>
        <p>However, when we skip breakfast, our fat burning hormone levels remain low&#133;</p>
        <p>And when our fat burning hormone levels are low, we can continue to tap into stored fat and burn it for fuel all day long.</p>
    </item>
<hr class="hr3">
    <p class="rules-hdr"><strong>RULE #3:</strong> “Eat 3-6 small meals during the day.”</p>
    <item class="rules-bdy">
        <p>Any busy guy will tell you that having to stop what he’s doing every 2-3 hours to choke down a boring diet meal isn’t something he enjoys doing&#133;</p>
        <p>It’s hard to stay productive when you’re constantly interrupting yourself to eat.</p>
        <p>Not to mention the prep work you have to do to make sure you have 3 healthy meals pre-made and packed when you go to work is a huge pain&#133;<p>
        <p>But fortunately for guys who want to lose weight... It’s not a necessary evil like most of us have been lead to believe&#133; And it all ties back to your master fat-storing hormone.</p>
        <p>When you eat every 2-3 hours, your body remains in what’s called a ‘fed state.’</p>
        <p>In this state, your fat burning hormone level remains high all day long… Which means you’re practically in fat storing mode all day long.</p>
        <p>Because you’re constantly eating, you never give your body a chance to reach it’s natural fat burning state&#133;</p>
        <p>And like I mentioned earlier, we need to have low fat burning hormone levels in order to achieve that.</p>
    </item>
<hr class="hr3">
    <p class="rules-hdr"><strong>RULE #4:</strong> “You have to change WHAT you eat to lose weight.”</p>
    <item class="rules-bdy">
        <p>We’ve all heard it before&#133;</p>
        <p>Cut your carbs&#133; Go low-fat&#133; Eat less calories&#133; Avoid junk food at ALL costs&#133;</p>
        <p>Every diet plan under the sun has some sort of ‘restriction’ placed on what types of foods you can and can’t eat in order to see results&#133;<p>
        <p>And for me, sacrificing the enjoyment of food wasn’t really the way I wanted to live my life.</p>
        <p>Most diets condition you to feel guilty about eating the foods you love… Or cause you to feel like you’re a failure when you give into temptation and splurge a little.</p>
        <p>I think that fundamentally, this is the reason why ‘traditional diets’ don’t work&#133;</p>
        <p>But like I said, fasting isn’t a diet… It’s a way of scheduling the timeframe in which you eat so you can reach your natural fat-burning state.</p>
        <p>That means that in order to see results, you don’t have to restrict yourself from eating the food you love&#133; You just have to modify when it is that you eat.</p>
        <p>Now I’m not saying that you should take up fasting so you can eat icecream and twinkies every night&#133; Because even though you may still lose weight, it won’t be healthy&#133;</p>
        <p>There’s a very specific balance - and that’s what my Science Based Sixpack Program is designed to provide to men who are finally ready to lose weight while feeling completely satisfying in the process.</p>

                <li><strong>9 at-home total body workout videos</strong> for maximizing your results while following the Intermittent Fasting plan</li>
                <li>Each video includes <strong>live demonstrations</strong> of every exercise in each <strong>25 minute routine</strong> plus expert commentary providing form tips and exercise modifications to meet your fitness level</li>
                <li>Using the <strong>"Time Under Tension'</strong> principle, you'll never have to keep count of reps again - Instead, you'll feel the burn by syncing up with the built-in timer within each workout video so all you have to do is simply watch, follow and repeat.</li>
            </ul>
            <item>The ShredFast Workout Course is my at-home total body training system that will complement the weight loss effects of your intermittent fasting schedule... and help you reach your transformation goals even faster.</item><br><br>

            <item>This program utilizes a principle called ‘Time Under Tension’ (TUT)which emphasizes the total amount of time a muscle is under tension. Training for time instead of counting reps allows you to maximize glycogen depletion and release more stored fat from the body because your muscles are working non-stop. </item><br><br>

            <item>Because the effects of training with TUT are so powerful for conditioning your body to burn stored energy, there’s no need to use any expensive gym equipment or even leave your home - In the ShredFast course, you will learn to use your body as the perfect ‘exercise machine’ for sculpting your ideal physique.</item>

The vast majority read or skim through it once, then do not implement the program or take any recommended action based. The results of our exercise methodology are intangible, and not measured in fat loss, muscle gain, abdominal definition, or other positive results of any kind. And even when consumers implement our product in full, more often than not they do not report increases in fat loss, muscle gain, abdominal definition, or other positive results of any kind. Reports of specific fat loss, muscle gain, abdominal definition, or any positive results of any kind should therefore be understood as the exception rather than the rule. Consumers who use our products can generally expect not to see any increase in fat loss, muscle gain, abdominal definition, or positive results of any kind. It is entirely possible you will gain fat, lose muscle, lose abdominal definition, and experience other negative outcomes as a result of the advice contained in our products.</p>

If we have disclosed typical results based on information provided to us by a manufacturer or other reputable third party source, you should presume that the typical results as stated are more reliable than the testimonials and other examples found at sixpackshortcuts.com and/or from SPS. However, you should always perform due diligence and not take such results at face value. We are not responsible for any errors or omissions in typical results information supplied to us by manufacturers or other reputable third parties. If a product or service is new, you understand that it may not have been available for purchase long enough to provide an accurate results history. Again, it is possible that even with perfect use of the program, you will not achieve the results described in testimonials. They are meant to be a showcase of the best results the program has produced, and should not be taken as the results a typical user will get.</p>
