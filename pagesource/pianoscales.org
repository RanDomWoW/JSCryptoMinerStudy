<h1>Piano scales – overviews and instructions</h1>

<br />
Because of the relationship of notes in certain scales, they will always sound well played together. A fact that  makes scales a primary foundation for everyone who wants to improvise on the instrument.

<br />

<h2>How to define scales</h2>
<p>Scales are a collection of tones that belong together, they could also belong to a certain<em> <a href="keys.html">key</a></em>. This relationship is also true about chords – but the difference between chords and scales is that a scale normally consists of more notes, which  are not played simultaneously as often is the case with chords.<br />
<br />
<span class="lilac">A scale is a collection of notes that have a musical connection and are building blocks for chords and starting-points for improvisation. By knowing and recognizing scales you will be able to place a song in a musical context and as a result be able to play it with less effort. Knowing scales on the piano can of course also assist you in composing your own music.</span></p>
<h3>Attitudes toward scales</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, this part of your piano education is sometimes given negative connotations: scales are intruding on your freedom of creativity and things like that. The truth is that scales aren't some strict rules, but more like a background in your practice. (As a footnote atonal music could be mentioned here, that is a reaction against the tonal music).<br />
<br />
Exactly which scales you should focus upon will depend on the musical styles that interest you. But generally it is a good advice to learn the common <i>major scales</i> considering how common they are in piano music. Important to study is also the <i>minor scale</i> which exist in three different versions – the natural, the harmonic and the melodic. Don't worry, they are almost similar but the distinctions will give you new possibilities. The <i>pentatonic scales</i> are also common and in some styles the <i>modal scales</i> are frequently used.</p>
<h3>The keyboard</h3>
<p>The piano has 88 keys that are put together on a <em>keyboard</em>. As shown in the picture below  the keyboard on a piano is symmetrical arranged in twelve –  seven white and five black –  keys that are repeated (some exceptions are  shown in the left and right ends). These keys are also ordered in <em>octaves</em> that makes eight notes. Every interval between two notes of the same tone, like a C to a higher C, is an octave.</p>

<h3>The notes</h3>
<p>Playing piano is often made by reading notes. Below you can see an illustration of notes on a staff –  this time as the scale of D major.<br />
