That morning I was so excited to go to the <em>Blue Hole<\/em>. The <em>Blue Hole<\/em>, is a spot in the middle of the jungle where you cliff dive and rope swing into little lagoons, it\u2019s awesome!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAs I was preparing to jump off the cliff, I accidentally slipped on a piece of algae on the waterfall and fell down hard. After my initial fall, I slid to the edge of the waterfall and was desperately trying to grab onto something so I didn\u2019t go over the waterfall. I wasn\u2019t able to grab onto anything and over the waterfall I went. When I hit the water I noticed right away my right foot had hit something. I swam over to the edge and the tour guides and random tourists were screaming and in a state of panic!<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn\u2019t put any weight on my foot and several people had to carry me. I decided to not go to the hospital. I honestly thought I had a very bad ankle sprain.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>We went back to the hotel and I had to get a wheelchair to get back to my room\u2014there was no way I could make it without some help. I was mentally crushed. &nbsp;I passed the final few days of vacation lying by the pool.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Sunday January 10, 2016 I got on the plane and made the three hour flight back to Philadelphia. I drove my car home and decided I should go to the hospital.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the hospital I was taken for x-rays. They diagnosed me with a broken foot, but didn\u2019t tell me the exact type of fracture. Eventually, the hospital gave me a card to setup an appointment with Dr. Joseph Daniel.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tuesday January 12, 2016 was the day that I felt my whole world had ended. Dr. Daniel explained I needed major surgery.&nbsp; The diagnosis was a Displaced Talus Fracture. Thankfully Dr. Daniel is the best and assured me that I would be ok. I trusted him right away. My surgery was set for January 18, 2016.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The surgery was completed with no pain or complications and the road to recovery began. I had to lay in bed 24\/7 with right foot elevated for several days. Then I was casted and told to lay with the foot elevated. Two months later, I got my cast off and I thought life could go on! Man, was I wrong!<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started my rehabilitation soon after the cast came off. I literally had to learn how to walk and use my right foot again. I spent all of 2016 rehabbing.

That morning I was so excited to go to the <em>Blue Hole<\/em>. The <em>Blue Hole<\/em>, is a spot in the middle of the jungle where you cliff dive and rope swing into little lagoons, it\u2019s awesome!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAs I was preparing to jump off the cliff, I accidentally slipped on a piece of algae on the waterfall and fell down hard. After my initial fall, I slid to the edge of the waterfall and was desperately trying to grab onto something so I didn\u2019t go over the waterfall. I wasn\u2019t able to grab onto anything and over the waterfall I went. When I hit the water I noticed right away my right foot had hit something. I swam over to the edge and the tour guides and random tourists were screaming and in a state of panic!<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn\u2019t put any weight on my foot and several people had to carry me. I decided to not go to the hospital. I honestly thought I had a very bad ankle sprain.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>We went back to the hotel and I had to get a wheelchair to get back to my room\u2014there was no way I could make it without some help. I was mentally crushed. &nbsp;I passed the final few days of vacation lying by the pool.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Sunday January 10, 2016 I got on the plane and made the three hour flight back to Philadelphia. I drove my car home and decided I should go to the hospital.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the hospital I was taken for x-rays. They diagnosed me with a broken foot, but didn\u2019t tell me the exact type of fracture. Eventually, the hospital gave me a card to setup an appointment with Dr. Joseph Daniel.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tuesday January 12, 2016 was the day that I felt my whole world had ended. Dr. Daniel explained I needed major surgery.&nbsp; The diagnosis was a Displaced Talus Fracture. Thankfully Dr. Daniel is the best and assured me that I would be ok. I trusted him right away. My surgery was set for January 18, 2016.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The surgery was completed with no pain or complications and the road to recovery began. I had to lay in bed 24\/7 with right foot elevated for several days. Then I was casted and told to lay with the foot elevated. Two months later, I got my cast off and I thought life could go on! Man, was I wrong!<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started my rehabilitation soon after the cast came off. I literally had to learn how to walk and use my right foot again. I spent all of 2016 rehabbing. I love basketball more than anything and I missed it so much. I didn\u2019t touch or shoot a basketball for nine months. It felt like a lifetime to me!<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the beginning on 2017, I started to slowly run again and build up my strength and conditioning to start playing basketball.

Ordinarily, the elbow is held in place by the network of ligaments and muscles that connect with the bone surface. This type of traumatic impact, however, can push and rotate on the elbow, often resulting in it being destabilized.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elbow dislocations often occur when a slip, trip, or fall is braced with outstretched hands. For this reason, these injuries are common among upright winter sports that are prone to falls, such as skiing, snowboarding, and ice skating. Tobogganing and sledding are likewise common culprits, due to the tendency of riders to brace for impact using their outstretched hands during an accident.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Diagnosing Dislocated Elbows<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dislocated elbows are emergency injuries that demand immediate treatment. After an injury occurs, undergoing an examination for proper diagnosis and subsequent treatment is essential. Injured persons must not attempt to reset their elbows independently; professional medical care is needed to avoid doing further damage or elbow dislocation complications.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of your examination, you will undergo physical and visual tests (including x-rays), to assess the extent of damage and the degree dislocation. Using these tests, your physician will be able to determine if you have experienced a complete or partial dislocation. Your diagnosis will likewise assess whether the dislocation is simple (no major bone injuries), complex (associated bone and ligament injuries), or severe (bone damage, blood vessel and nerve damage).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A proper, informed diagnosis will ensure that you receive effective treatment that is suited to the particular conditions of your injury.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Effective Treatments for Dislocations<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Elbow dislocation treatment depends greatly upon the type and severity of the injury; how to fix a dislocated elbow will depend upon the specific conditions of your elbow dislocation and general orthopaedic health.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For less serious (partial or simple) dislocations, normal alignment can be manually achieved. The patient will either be given pain killers or sedated; then, the reduction maneuver is gently performed to return the elbow to its proper location within the joint. The elbow will then be kept in a sling or splint and treated with physical therapy and elbow exercises.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the case of complex and severe dislocations, surgery may be recommended in order to properly fix misaligned bones and damaged ligaments; if nerves and blood vessels are damaged, they too will require surgical repair. Following reconstructive surgery, the elbow may be stabilized using an external hinge.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>An elbow dislocation is a serious injury that is common among winter sports athletes and participants; it merits quality, effective treatment.

Dress Like an Onion.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A popular phrase among winter runners, this reminder refers to wearing layers in order to regulate body temperature and stay comfortable. This may seem like less of a concern if you\u2019re just heading out to the mailbox, but staying warm and dry eliminates distraction and shivering from becoming too cold, allowing you to focus on your steps and the task at hand. Whatever your activity, always wear warm outerwear and thick, winter-weight socks, and keep an extra set of gloves with you, just in case<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-31be9b1c-d2e9-c9be-ff57-468ac9cb3edd\">2. Invest in Good Gear.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Make sure you have a full complement of quality winter protection in good repair and that fits you well. These items should include: a warm and waterproof overcoat; protection for head, ears, hands, and neck; sunglasses; and especially for preventing those ankle strains and twists: waterproof footwear with good tread.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-31be9b1c-d2e9-c9be-ff57-468ac9cb3edd\">3. Check the Weather.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It may seem obvious, but it\u2019s important to get a complete picture of the expected conditions before embarking on a winter activity. Be aware of the outlook for the day\u2019s temperatures, precipitation, wind speed, and daylight hours to ensure that conditions for your activity are manageable. If the forecast is at all hazardous, postpone your activity until another day.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-31be9b1c-d2e9-c9be-ff57-468ac9cb3edd\">4. Keep Goals Small and Get Home Early.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When planning any winter activity, be reasonable about the distance and difficulty of terrain. What may be a brief run in the summer can multiply exponentially in hazards during winter weather. Keep your goals small, work extra time into your plan, and remember that the sun sets much earlier in the winter months, refreezing surfaces and increasing the likelihood of ankle strains and twists due to falls.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-31be9b1c-d2e9-c9be-ff57-468ac9cb3edd\">5. Travel with a Reliable Friend.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The company of friends makes nearly every activity more fun, and they can make it more safe as well. Having a reliable friend along on your run can help you with remembering your gear, plotting a safe course, and keeping you alert to dangerous conditions. In addition, if the worst should happen and you should incur an injury, a friend can assist you in getting medical attention right away.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-31be9b1c-d2e9-c9be-ff57-468ac9cb3edd\">6. Always be Prepared to Turn Around.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you run into conditions that look or feel too dangerous, don\u2019t try to be a hero. Turn around! No run is worth enduring preventable ankle strains and twists or worse. Get to shelter as safely as you can and stay there until the danger has passed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Incorporating the wisdom of winter runners into our daily commute and lives can increase your chances of a safe season, yet we at Rothman Institute know that accidents still happen. The first step for anyone experiencing symptoms or complications from a sprained ankle or ankle strains and twists should be to consult their physicians right away.

Whatever your activity, always wear warm outerwear and thick, winter-weight socks, and keep an extra set of gloves with you, just in case<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-31be9b1c-d2e9-c9be-ff57-468ac9cb3edd\">2. Invest in Good Gear.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Make sure you have a full complement of quality winter protection in good repair and that fits you well. These items should include: a warm and waterproof overcoat; protection for head, ears, hands, and neck; sunglasses; and especially for preventing those ankle strains and twists: waterproof footwear with good tread.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-31be9b1c-d2e9-c9be-ff57-468ac9cb3edd\">3. Check the Weather.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It may seem obvious, but it\u2019s important to get a complete picture of the expected conditions before embarking on a winter activity. Be aware of the outlook for the day\u2019s temperatures, precipitation, wind speed, and daylight hours to ensure that conditions for your activity are manageable. If the forecast is at all hazardous, postpone your activity until another day.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-31be9b1c-d2e9-c9be-ff57-468ac9cb3edd\">4. Keep Goals Small and Get Home Early.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When planning any winter activity, be reasonable about the distance and difficulty of terrain. What may be a brief run in the summer can multiply exponentially in hazards during winter weather. Keep your goals small, work extra time into your plan, and remember that the sun sets much earlier in the winter months, refreezing surfaces and increasing the likelihood of ankle strains and twists due to falls.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-31be9b1c-d2e9-c9be-ff57-468ac9cb3edd\">5. Travel with a Reliable Friend.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The company of friends makes nearly every activity more fun, and they can make it more safe as well. Having a reliable friend along on your run can help you with remembering your gear, plotting a safe course, and keeping you alert to dangerous conditions. In addition, if the worst should happen and you should incur an injury, a friend can assist you in getting medical attention right away.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-31be9b1c-d2e9-c9be-ff57-468ac9cb3edd\">6. Always be Prepared to Turn Around.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you run into conditions that look or feel too dangerous, don\u2019t try to be a hero. Turn around! No run is worth enduring preventable ankle strains and twists or worse. Get to shelter as safely as you can and stay there until the danger has passed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Incorporating the wisdom of winter runners into our daily commute and lives can increase your chances of a safe season, yet we at Rothman Institute know that accidents still happen. The first step for anyone experiencing symptoms or complications from a sprained ankle or ankle strains and twists should be to consult their physicians right away. When you need more specialized treatment, Rothman Institute can help you decide which options are right for you.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contact Rothman Institute today to schedule an appointment <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rothmaninstitute.com\/contact\/for-patients\/make-an-appointment\">here<\/a><a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"> <\/a>or by calling <b>800-321-9999.<\/b><\/p>"},"sto_block_size":{"id":"168","label":"Story Block Size","value":["1"],"display":"1"},"created":{"id":"2","label":"Created","value":"2018-02-26 16:14:45","display":"Monday, 26 February 2018\r\n\t\t<meta itemprop=\"dateCreated\" content=\"2018-02-26 16:14:45\">\r\n\t"},"document_type":{"id":"8","label":"Document type","value":"News & Blog","display":"News & Blog"},"sticky_date":{"id":"241","label":"Sticky Date","value":null,"display":""}},{"id":"2968","url":"https:\/\/www.rothmaninstitute.com\/stories\/ambassadors\/john-rotator-cuff-tear","image":"https:\/\/www.rothmaninstitute.com\/images\/stories\/flexicontent\/s_59dfb6797c115-ck7a8397-wide.jpg","title":"John - Rotator Cuff Tear","date":"13 February 2018","main_video":{"id":"89","label":"Main Video","value":null,"display":""},"main_image":{"id":"67","label":"Main Image","value":[{"originalname":"59dfb6797c115-ck7a8397-wide.jpg","existingname":"","alt":"","title":"","desc":""}],"display":"<img src=\"\/images\/stories\/flexicontent\/l_59dfb6797c115-ck7a8397-wide.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"fc_field_image\" itemprop=\"image\"\/>"},"text":{"id":"1","label":"Description","value":"<p>I am a 71 year old former athlete and I tore my Rotator Cuff last September playing softball in the Montgomery County Senior Softball league.

Typically urgent cares do not have a long wait times like emergency departments. At an orthopaedic urgent care, patients are quickly evaluated by orthopaedic specialists, who are trained in musculoskeletal injuries and best qualified to offer you treatment. Your orthopaedic specialist will perform a physical exam to assess you. She or he will order and review an x-ray on site to diagnose and determine how serious the condition is. Depending upon your injury, additional studies may be needed such as CT scans, MRIs, ultrasound, etc. Sometimes a splint or a other orthotic is needed; other times your injury may require physical therapy or further evaluation by an orthopaedic subspecialist.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>After some falls, you may not feel the effects of your injury immediately. Symptoms of swelling and pain may not appear right away, or you may feel they will pass with time. It is not too late to be evaluated by an orthopaedic specialist. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rothmaninstitute.com\/stories\/news-and-blog\/sprains-in-the-winter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Symptoms of pain<\/a> should not be ignored.

The question is \u2014 what should I do next?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the case of a serious accident, your first resource will be calling 9-1-1 and going to the emergency department. They will help stabilize your injury. If specialized care is indicated, the emergency department will recommend you see an orthopaedic specialist.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Less severely injured patients may seek out an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rothmaninstitute.com\/locations\/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">orthopaedic urgent care<\/a>. Typically urgent cares do not have a long wait times like emergency departments. At an orthopaedic urgent care, patients are quickly evaluated by orthopaedic specialists, who are trained in musculoskeletal injuries and best qualified to offer you treatment. Your orthopaedic specialist will perform a physical exam to assess you. She or he will order and review an x-ray on site to diagnose and determine how serious the condition is. Depending upon your injury, additional studies may be needed such as CT scans, MRIs, ultrasound, etc. Sometimes a splint or a other orthotic is needed; other times your injury may require physical therapy or further evaluation by an orthopaedic subspecialist.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>After some falls, you may not feel the effects of your injury immediately. Symptoms of swelling and pain may not appear right away, or you may feel they will pass with time. It is not too late to be evaluated by an orthopaedic specialist. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rothmaninstitute.com\/stories\/news-and-blog\/sprains-in-the-winter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Symptoms of pain<\/a> should not be ignored. The best course of action in a case like this is to seek the help of a medical professional.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be prepared for the approaching winter weather. If you or a loved one suffers from a fall, you can be assured that comprehensive, compassionate care is available from Rothman Institute and our two orthopaedic urgent cares.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about symptoms or treatment from slipping on ice near you, please visit us <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rothmaninstitute.com\/contact\/for-patients\/make-an-appointment\">here<\/a><a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"> <\/a>or contact us at<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-45e9cba3-e47a-cb47-0ed1-c5b709926ad4\"> 1-800-321-9999<\/b>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are open seven days a week!<\/p>"},"sto_block_size":{"id":"168","label":"Story Block Size","value":["1"],"display":"1"},"created":{"id":"2","label":"Created","value":"2017-11-22 16:36:38","display":"Wednesday, 22 November 2017\r\n\t\t<meta itemprop=\"dateCreated\" content=\"2017-11-22 16:36:38\">\r\n\t"},"document_type":{"id":"8","label":"Document type","value":"News & Blog","display":"News & Blog"},"sticky_date":{"id":"241","label":"Sticky Date","value":null,"display":""}},{"id":"1244","url":"https:\/\/www.rothmaninstitute.com\/stories\/news-and-blog\/rothman-institute-ice-rink-dilworth-park-city-hall-philadelphia","image":"https:\/\/www.rothmaninstitute.com\/images\/stories\/flexicontent\/s_ri_rink_banner-1.jpg","title":"Rothman Institute Ice Rink at Dilworth Park","date":"21 November 2017","intro":"The new Rothman Institute Ice Rink at Dilworth Park is open seven days a week through February 26, 2017.","main_video":{"id":"89","label":"Main Video","value":null,"display":""},"main_image":{"id":"67","label":"Main Image","value":[{"originalname":"ri_rink_banner-1.jpg","existingname":"","alt":"","title":"","desc":""}],"display":"<img src=\"\/images\/stories\/flexicontent\/l_ri_rink_banner-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"fc_field_image\" itemprop=\"image\"\/>"},"text":{"id":"1","label":"Article Content *","value":"<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

Every year kids, adults, and families get in their cars and head to the closest mountains. A broken wrist or ankle are common winter injuries that could quickly derail a fun day (and the rest of the season) on the mountain.

There are three grades of ankle sprains: mild, moderate, and severe. Most mild sprains simply require rest and ice for recovery. However, if it becomes difficult to walk on and remains swollen, it is important to see a doctor.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ankle sprains during winter activities may be caused by:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-99e47604-a2d5-db64-0aa3-aa9beb2b4ec2\">Walking and then falling on an uneven surface<\/b><\/p>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-99e47604-a2d5-db64-0aa3-aa9beb2b4ec2\">Playing sports that require cutting, such as ice hockey or skiing<\/b><\/p>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-99e47604-a2d5-db64-0aa3-aa9beb2b4ec2\">Someone stepping on the foot during activity<\/b><\/p>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>After spraining your ankle you may experience swelling, bruising, instability of the ankle, or pain when pressure is applied. Severe sprains might exhibit symptoms similar to a broken ankle such as immediate, throbbing pain, swelling, bruising, deformity and difficulty walking or bearing weight. It is important to seek out a physician right away if this happens.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.orthoinfo.org\/topic.cfm?topic=A00111\">Ankle strains<\/a> are injuries sustained to the muscles or tendons. Tendons connect muscles to bones and occur like a sprain. Tendons can either be strained or torn completely, similarly to a sprain.

Ankle strain recovery time is usually around two to three weeks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sports like ice hockey and skiing require cutting motions and can increase the likelihood of sustaining an injury.
