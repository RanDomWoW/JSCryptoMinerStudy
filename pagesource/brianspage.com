Welcome to my page. This site is dedicated to discussing scenes
of women in bondage as they appear in the mainstream media.</p>
<p>
We celebrate the so-called Damsel in Distress, who had a powerful effect
on many of us as these images beamed into our homes during our youth.
Perhaps that's why there is such an interest, even though commercially
produced videos dedicated to bondage are widely available. </p>
<p>The mainstream
scenes just have a certain "je ne sais quoi" for us that the commercial
tapes can't capture. Perhaps it the thrill of seeing a famous actress in
a scene, or the improvement that their acting skill has on the scene.
I think it is largely due to the accidental nature of the bondage scene
found in a TV show or movie. In some way, it feels like you've made a capture
of our own, rather than being handed the scene.   </p>
<p>
That all being said, this site is not about violence or degradation of
women. We aren't looking to punish women, or to deny them their rightful
place in a free, open and just society. We just like seeing them tied up
on TV! </p>
<p>
Here you will find various forums dedicated to general discussion, VCR
alerts to catch upcoming TV events, a similar one for theatrical
movies, plus a trade page where you can swap scenes with other
collectors. There's also a large cooperative database of scenes, so you can
look for scenes with your favorite actress or from a TV show, or add some 
scenes of your own.</p>
