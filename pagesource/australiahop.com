<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">On its 15th year of partnership between Witchery and the <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="https://ocrf.com.au/">Ovarian Cancer Research Foundation</a> (OCRF), local celebs and personalities gathered at the Sydney Opera House to lend their support and celebrate the money they've helped Witchery raise for the foundation - over $6.1 million.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">A large number of fashion-minded guests - including South Sydney Rabbitohs' Tom Burgess, Cheyenne Yozzi, Samantha Harris, Jessica Gomes, Matt Moran, Didier Cohen, Amanda Ware, Nicole Pollard and Vogue magazine editor-in-chief, Edwina McCann -turned up in white shirts - the best, most chic dress code - to manifest their support.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">Guests took their support to social media with the hashtag &ldquo;#whiteshirtcampaign&rdquo; &mdash; a movement nationwide that will encourage people to buy the white Witchery shirts, with all profits going towards finding an early detection of ovarian cancer.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">This year's message is clear: Wear, Share, Donate. The event also indicated the launch of Witchery's seventh annual White Shirt Campaign in stores across Australia and New Zealand, and online at witchery.com.au with the assistance of influential celebrities.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">Campaign ambassadors include Cheyenne Tozzi, Didier Cohen, Jordan &amp; Zac Stenmark, Elyse Taylor and Erin Shea.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">Nine women's shirt styles and one essential men's shirt will be available for purchase. The selection is more collectable than ever thanks to two designs by Melbourne-based Whitehouse Institute of Design students Erin Haigh and Georgie Dunn. Both are the dual winners of the annual Witchery White Shirt Design Award.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8">100% of the proceeds from the sale of the Witchery White Shirt collection are donated to the OCRF to support vital research initiatives to find an early detection test for ovarian cancer.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">This is a fundamental help to OCRF since the organisation receives no government funding and relies on the financial support of corporate Australia and the broader community.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph10">Some of ovarian cancer facts are as follow:  -	One Australian woman dies every ten hours from ovarian cancer, and 350 new cases are diagnosed in New Zealand each year -	Ovarian cancer is the main cause of death of all gynaecological cancers. -	Unlike other cancers, there is no early detection test. -	It is a common spread believe that a Pap smear diagnoses ovarian cancer but this is incorrect. -	Ovarian cancer has a lower survival rate than both breast and cervical cancer. The way to chance these statistics is early detection. -	When detected and treated early, 80-100 per cent of women survive beyond five years compared with only 20-30 per cent when diagnosed.</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>The 29-year-old actress Amber Heard, along with her husband Johnny Depp, issued the most laughably awkward apology from their Gold Coast hotel while in Australia as Heard faced charges over bringing the couple's two dogs to Australia illegally last year.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">Heard was issued with a one-month good behaviour bond after admitting to falsifying customs documents in unlawful bringing their pair's dogs, Pistol and Boo, into Australia from the US in April last year. This was during the time that Johnny Depp was filming another movie of the Pirates of the Caribbean.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">According to the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, the Hollywood couple were less than willing to participate in this video on Australian biosecurity. As part of the case, Heard and Depp released a video that was played in court, lauding Australia's biosecurity rules.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">A spokesman for the Department of Agriculture said Heard offered her repentance for breaking the rules, and to cover the costs of the video. However, Joyce seemed unsure.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">&ldquo;It was offered. Whether the court accepts it or not as part of an outcome is really the realm of the court, and in this instance the court did,&rdquo; he told reporters. &ldquo;I don't think it is something they would have willingly wanted to do.&rdquo;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">He said everyone entering Australia should respect the country's &ldquo;particular nuances.&rdquo; &ldquo;Every nation has something its red-hot about, and we're red-hot about biosecurity requirements in this nation,&rdquo; Joyce said.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">However, the video was a real punishment for the couple which depicts both Depp and Heard looking very sorry for themselves while certifying their respect and love for Australia,  as well as the importance of bio-security laws. Starting off with Heard's solemn statement &ldquo;Australia is a wonderful island&rdquo;, the apology goes from bad to worse, and of course, the video broke the Internet and caused mockery of them far and wide.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8">It could have been worse. In 2015, Joyce threatened to have Pistol and Boo killed. But now Joyce is satisfied with the pair's international humiliation, even questioning Depp's acting skills.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">&ldquo;What I can say is although I don't think he'll get an academy award for his performance, the fact that he did it &hellip; he looked like he was auditioning for the Godfather," said Joyce.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10">"At the end of it we've got a message that is going all around the world right now, it's going off like a frog in a sock telling people that if you come into this nation and you don't obey our laws, you're in trouble."</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph11">"As far as me directing this atrocious movie, no, even I could have done a little better than that. Do it again Johnny, do it with gusto mate, a little gusto."</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph12">This is the transcript of the video:</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph13">Amber Laura Heard: Australia is a wonderful island with a treasure trove of unique plants, animals and people.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph14">John Christopher &ldquo;Johnny&rdquo; Depp II: That has to be protected.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph15">Australia is free of many pests and diseases that are common place around the world. That is why Australia has to have such strong biosecurity laws.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph16">[Johnny Depp:] And Australians are just as unique, both warm and direct. When you disrespect Australian law they will tell you firmly.</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>The Aussie/Hollywood star Chris Hemsworth thought his personal cards and a wad of cash were gone for good when he left them at a restaurant. However, fate had a surprise in store for him when 17-year-old Tristin Budzyn-Barker contacted his representatives to say he had found the items and wanted to reunite them with their owner.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">Chris wrote back to Tristin and gifted him the entire cash contents of the wallet, which he "never expected to see again".</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">Chris explained: "I went to pick up my wife and daughter from the airport and we were a little early so we were killing some time and went to have something to eat. It was a pretty rough little area and we sat down and I left my wallet on the table, and thought 'I'm never going to get it back, I'm never going to see it again.'</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">"My business manager contacts me because it's my address on my license, and this letter from this young boy (...) and he's found my wallet."</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">The 17-year-old admitted he was &ldquo;speechless&rdquo; to find the Hollywood actor's wallet. The everyday hero was bound to have yet another surprise when he was invited onto &ldquo;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&rdquo; and there Ellen presented Tristin with a $10,000 cheque to be put toward his college fund, donated by image publishing company Shutterfly.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">Apparently, the teenaged would have been content just to attend the taping of the talk show. Meeting Tristin on the show, &ldquo;The Huntsman: Winter's War&rdquo; actor added: &ldquo;He sent the wallet to me and he said &lsquo;P.S. Mum saw you were on Ellen this week and asked if we could have some tickets.'&rdquo;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">He said at Ellen's show that they investigated who the wallet belonged to and once he found out he said: &ldquo;Mum, you know who this is? We found Thor's wallet&rdquo;.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph8">He asked Chris Hemsworth if he could write him a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; letter because the teenager is trying to earn the rank of Eagle Scout, so Chris Hemsworth gave him the letter on Ellen show. The teenager wants the Eagle Batch to keep building shelters for horses.</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>A unique annual event of light, music and ideas, <a target='_blank' href="https://www.vividsydney.com/" target="_blank">Vivid Sydney</a> is a multi-award winning winter festival which features an outdoor &ldquo;gallery&rdquo; of extraordinary lighting sculptures, a cutting-edge contemporary music program, some of the world's most important creative industry forums and, last but not least, the mesmerising illumination of the Sydney Opera House. Next one will be <strong>25 May - 16 June 2018</strong></p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">Every year, the festival returns to illuminate Sydney with new thrilling precincts to explore, new light art to inspire and a feast of entertainment for everyone. This event has grown into the largest of its kind in the world, attracting more than 1.7 million visitors ear year.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">Part of the lighting festival also includes performances from local and international musicians and an ideas exchange forum featuring public talks and debates from leading creative thinkers.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">The winter event takes place in central Sydney over the course of three weeks in May and June. The centrepiece of Vivid Sydney is the light sculptures, multimedia interactive work and building projections that transform various buildings and landmarks such as the Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge in and around the Sydney CBD into an outdoor night time canvas of art.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5"><a target='_blank' href="https://www.facebook.com/vividsydney" target="_blank">Vivid</a> began as a Smart light festival in 2009 for energy efficiency curated by Lighting Designer Mary-Anne Kyriakou and headlined by Brian Eno. The latter, in collaboration with lighting designer Bruce Ramus, projected Light Painting onto both sides of the Opera House.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">Vivid is also a commercial success. According to New South Wales Deputy Premier Andrew Stoner, Vivid 2012 attracted more than 500,000 visitors to the outdoor exhibition and events, generating around $10 million in income for the state. One year later, the festival attracted more than 800,000 visitors, contributing more than $20 million to the NSW economy.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">In 2014, the festival involved the Sydney Opera House, Walsh bay, Circular Quay, The Rocks, North Sydney, Darling Harbour, and, joining in for the first time, Harbour Lights, The Star and Carriageworks. In 2015, Vivid Sydney attracted more than 1.7 million visitors to the city.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8">Vivid Sydney also includes a large range of interactive activities with the unique technology that is offered. While the large light shows are displayed on the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Birdge, there are also multiple smaller exhibits located around the harbour.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">One of the interactive activities in the harbour was called Musical cubes. In this activity, a group of 6 individuals would take part in a musical experiment.  There is also another activity in the harbour called the Heart of the City.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10">The Heart of the City resembled a large, solid beanbag chair and was located near the Sydney Opera House. Upon reaching the front of the line, participants would be asked to seat themselves in the middle of the chair. Once seated, they had to insert their fingers into a small hole in the middle of the chair. If your finger was inserted right, the chair would begin to light up red to match your heartbeat. As participants realised this, their heart rate would increase causing the chair to light up very quickly.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph11">Another activity involved <a target='_blank' href="https://www.canon.com.au/vivid" target="_blank">Canon</a> Cameras. So if you attend VIVID Sydney with a Canon camera, you are able to participate in special unique activities that are meant to make use of your Canon Camera.</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span><a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="http://www.acdc.com/"><strong>AC/DC</strong></a> officially announced the departure of longtime frontman Brian Johnson and his - at least temporary - replace by Guns N' Roses' Axl Rose. Brian Johnson was suffering of hearing issues that impeded him to carry on with the tour prompting the band to find a replacement for the vocals that could do justice to Johnson. Rose seemed to be the right replacement at the moment as AC/DC are currently touring and they have shows to perform ahead.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">Here's the complete press release:   "AC/DC band members would like to thank <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Johnson">Brian Johnson</a> for his contributions and dedication to the band throughout the years. We wish him all the best with his hearing issues and future ventures.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">"As much as we want this tour to end as it started, we understand, respect and support Brian's decision to stop touring and save his hearing. We are dedicated to fulfilling the remainder of our touring commitments to everyone that has supported us over the years, and are fortunate that Axl Rose has kindly offered his support to help us fulfill this commitment."   AC/DC will continue their Rock or Bust World Tour with Rose on vocals. The band will resume their 10 postponed U.S. shows with Rose on vocals, and then tour around Europe before the end of the World Tour. Following this European concerts with AC/DC, Rose will resume the Not in This Lifetime summer stadium tour with <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="http://www.gunsnroses.com/"><strong>Guns N' Roses</strong></a>.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">In the meantime, Brian Johnson has released a heartfelt message to fans explaining why he has quit the world tour. However, he has promised he will be the voice of <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="http://www.acdc.com/">AC/DC</a> on upcoming studio recordings and hopes to be able to tour again the future.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">"I was advised that if I continue to perform at large venues, I risked total deafness,&rdquo; stated Johnson. &ldquo;While I was horrified at the reality of the news that day, I had for a time become aware that my partial hearing loss was beginning to interfere with my performance on stage.&rdquo;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">&ldquo;Our fans deserve my performance to be at the highest level, and if for any reason I can't deliver that level of performance I will not disappoint our fans or embarrass the other members of AC/DC," he added.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">"I wish to assure our fans that I am not retiring. My doctors have told me that I can continue to record in studios and I intend to do that. For the moment, my entire focus is to continue medical treatment to improve my hearing. I am hoping that in time my hearing will improve and allow me to return to live concert performances."</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8">Fans were shocked when they band cancelled their Atlanta show and issued a formal statement of their website about the rest of the tour. It stated: "AC/DC are forced to reschedule the 10 upcoming dates on the US leg of their Rock or Bust World Tour," it said.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">&ldquo;AC/DC's lead singer, Brian Johnson, has been advised by doctors to stop touring immediately or risk total hearing loss. Tuesday's show in Atlanta through Madison Square Garden in New York, NY in April 2016."</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10">However, the greatest shock happened when <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/axlrose">Axl Rose</a> was spotted rehearsing in Atlanta and news broke that he might be replacing Johnson. &ldquo;Yes, it's true,&rdquo; said Ross Malcolm Young, son of AC/DC founding member Malcolm Young.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph11">When some fans criticised the new choice of frontman arguing that Rose wasn't able to uphold the band's legacy, Ross Young responded by posting on Facebook: &ldquo;He can and he will.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="paragraph2">&nbsp;</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>Movie star Chris Hemsworth - famous for his performance as <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="http://marvel.com"><strong>Thor</strong></a> - has moved back home to Australia so his children can have a &lsquo;normal existence'.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">The Australian actor and his Spanish wife, also a Hollywood star, Elsa Pataky recently bought a property near Byron Bay on the NSW north coast.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">'We travelled so much anyway with work that our base didn't necessarily need to be in Hollywood so much anymore and it's just sort of chaotic with the paparazzi,' said Hemsworth. Accordingly, it was the &ldquo;best decision&rdquo; they ever made for their three children.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">'We can walk straight down (to) the beach, we can have a normal existence and the kids have a hell of a lot more fun there than they did back in the States,' said Hemsworth.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Hemsworth's career is currently on the rising. He recently starred in Ron Howard's new film In The Heart Of The Sea, a true maritime story that inspired Herman Melville to write Moby Dick.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">The 32-year-old actor confessed he has lost track of the number of scripts he is sent, but said he probably reads five or six a week. &ldquo;You go through periods, certain seasons, when there's just a mad rush of films to get financed and set up,'&rdquo; he said.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">&ldquo;A large percentage of what I get sent would be superhero-based action films but the ones you really want to do, in order to do something different, are the ones you've usually got to fight for and are a little more difficult to get made.&rdquo;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8">Although he usually has the pick of the scripts, Hemsworth is humble enough to say a couple of his contemporaries would eclipse him. 'Leo certainly is probably top of the food chain along with Brad Pitt and then you've got Tom Hardy and (Michael) Fassbender,' said Hemsworth.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">Hemsworth bought a $7 million Byron Bay home. The Australian-turned-Hollywood actor has spent no less than $7 million on a luxurious Balinese-style, seaside property near popular holiday spot Byron Bay. &ldquo;Kooeloah&rdquo; on Seven Mile Beach Rd in Broken Head spreads over 4.2ha and features a multi-level main house and multiple, separate villas.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10">The property has a total of 8 bedrooms and 11 barthrooms as well as a lap pool and a lagoon. The luxurious beach-side buy has taken place less than a year after Hemsworth and his wife snapped up their Malibu home for US$4.8 million.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph11">The house is no doubt big enough for the Hemsworth and their three children, two of which are twin boys.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph12">The Hemsworth haven't wasted any opportunity to enjoy what Byron Bay has to offer. They were seen on all loved-up at the 27th annual Byron Bay Blues Fest, on the New South Wales northern coast. They posted a photo to Instagram ahead of the Cold War Kids performance at the four-day music event. The Spanish actor captioned the post: &lsquo;Byron/Enjoying' and added a number of hashtags to the snap: &ldquo;blues fest en Byron&rdquo;, &ldquo;cold ward kids&rdquo;, &ldquo;music&rdquo;, &ldquo;love&rdquo;, &ldquo;partners night&rdquo; and &ldquo;yayyyy&rdquo;.</div>
<p>Next film we're eagerly waiting for is <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Thor"><strong>Thor: Ragnarok</strong></a> release date: November 3, 2017 (USA).</p>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>There is only one place to Bungy jump in Australia and that is in <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="http://www.australia.com/en/places/cairns.html"><strong>Cairns</strong></a>. Located in the rainforest, 20 mins from the CBD, AJ Hackett is the bungy originals and there can jump in many styles, swing and skywalk.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">It was <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="https://www.ajhackett.com/cairns/"><strong>AJ Hackett</strong></a> the Kiwi who invented the modern bungy in pursuit of the ultimate adrenalin buzz. In 1987, he jumped illegally from the Eiffel Tower and that is how he launched bungy jumping to the world. Almost 30 years later and millions of jumps, AJ Hackett now operates the world's most innovative gravity related products anywhere on the planet.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">Back in the 1980s, <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="https://www.ajhackett.com/cairns/"><strong>AJ Hackett</strong></a> was a young Auckland builder with a passion for thrill-inducing sports. Then he discovered a ritual by Pentecost Islanders by which men throw themselves off 35 metre-high wooden towers, with their ankles attacked to vines. This ancient ritual is believed to ensure a good yam harvest on the island in Vanatu.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">He didn't think much of this daring activity until he met Aucklander Chris Sigglekow in the early 1980s. As a video editor, Chris had seen 1970s video footage of a British group calling themselves the Oxford University Dangerous Sports Club, with young men undertaking a modern version of the Vanuatu jump. However, instead of wooden towers, the British men jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Chris had been inspired by the group's adventures and had already tried making a bungy cord with a parachute harness and jumping off the Pelorus Bridge in Marlborough, New Zealand. But the jump didn't go as planned so Chris shelved the idea till he met AJ. Together, they decided that if they could make the activity safe, then they could pursue it further.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">&ldquo;We decided, ok, let's suss out first of all if we can make this thing predictable. If we can't make it predictable then we stop &ndash; because I like a challenge but I don't like pain. I don't want to kill myself but I like to have some fun,&rdquo; AJ says. Therefore, they approached the Department of Scientific and Industrial research and there they discovered a mathematical formula for the bungy cord rubber.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">&ldquo;What we discovered was that if you took a single strand of the rubber and stretched it to 6.7-times its length, it would snap. But at four-times its length, it was only using 15 per cent of its breaking strain,&rdquo; AJ explains.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8">&ldquo;All we had to know was the height of the bridge that we were jumping from, divide it by four, less a couple of metres for the length of the person and the harness webbing attachment to the bungy, and that would be the length of the cord.&rdquo;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">They proceeded to test their bungy cord at the Greenhithe Bridge in Auckland. First they tried with a bag full of lead and rocks and then they tested it out themselves. They both jumped off and it worked perfectly. That is where the story began. They tried it a few more times with more friends jumping off the Auckland Harbour Bridge, until the time came to fly out to France.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10">When they arrived in France, they approached some scientists to find out how the bungy cord rubber would handle in freezing cold situations.  &ldquo;I had this dream of jumping from a cable car into the snow and skiing off. It was kind of this romantic vision,&rdquo; <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="https://www.ajhackett.com/cairns/"><strong>AJ</strong></a> says. Since it could be done, he convinced management at Tignes ski resort to let him jump head-first off a cable car. This was to be the first of many &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; jumps, but it was compared to his famous Eiffel Tower jump in Paris, June 26, 1987.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph11">&ldquo;When we'd first arrived in Paris we drove past the Eiffel Tower and I thought wow, that's a really beautiful structure, I'd love to jump off this building,&rdquo; he recalls &ldquo;So I measured the tower, figured it out how to jump from it, sorted out how the security worked, where the cameras were and all that sort of thing. One evening in Paris a big team of us went up to the tower. It was just closing, the girls were carrying bungy under their dresses, and in backpacks we had ropes and gear and camera crews and sleeping bags. Security all disappeared and so we settled in for the night and early the next morning the alarm went off too late so it was a rush job trying to get it rigged up, and finally we were ready to go. Anyway I jumped, the jump went perfectly and I was really happy to pull it off. And then the gendarmerie [French police] came from everywhere. They couldn't figure out what was going on at all. And the rest is history, really.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph12">AJ's stunt attracted media attention at a global scale. With the best publicity he could ask for, he returned to New Zealand and set up the world's first commercial bungy site in Ohajune in March 1988. And the rest is History.</div>
