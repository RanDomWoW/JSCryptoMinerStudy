		 <h1>5 Hints for Writing a Resume When You’re Just out of College</h1><p>     What do I write on my resume? What if I have little to no job experience? If these questions are lingering in your mind, you have no cause for worry. We know that stepping right out of college is a challenging time, you may be so unsure of yourself and your abilities and may not even have a clear picture of what you would like to pursue career-wise. You may also be worried about your chances of getting employed. However, statistics show that the rate of employment for young college graduates is 77% higher than that of high school graduates at 69%. Even so, millions of students graduate each year but the rate at which new jobs are being created can’t keep up. This means that there is stiff competition for the available spots.

		 <h1>How Words Hook Up With Each Other in Spoken English</h1><p>


IMPORTANT! Please grab a piece of paper and a pen before you start reading this article as you'll be required to write down a few English words if you decide to participate in a small experiment!

In this article we’ll look at how important it is to acquire new vocabulary in context, and how much time you may be wasting learning new words separately, just by learning meanings of new words or even worse – learning them through a translation in your native language. I've been discussing it on my blog and in my videos quite a lot, but I’ve never actually brought up certain examples to show you the effectiveness of learning new English words through context.

So, let’s do an experiment first.

It’s very important you participate in this because if you don’t, you won’t be able to feel the difference between learning new vocabulary with and without context, so please follow my instructions, all right? ;-)

Basically you'll have to make effort to memorize a few quite sophisticated English adjectives but in case you know a few or even all of those words, please don’t be offended! I’m not trying to insult your intelligence by making assumptions about your English vocabulary; I’ll be doing my best to pick out a few English words that aren’t heard that often in normal daily conversations or in media.

Now, please read the following five English words with the corresponding explanations and try to do your best to memorize those words and their meanings:

How is your fluency going?
What?
Good.
It's awesome then, but it breaks my heart when I see my dear readers, making mistakes while speaking or writing. And please don’t get me wrong, making a mistake is a part of the learning process, but correcting them is way more important than expanding your vocabulary or scaling up your fluency.
Thus, without further fuss, let get down to the job:
Pay close attention to the paragraph given below and find the mistakes from the context.

        <h1>20 Common English Mistakes Made by Indian People</h1><p>

Depending on whether you are a native speaker or not, the English language can either be hard or simple to learn. Most non-native speakers consider it hard to learn especially in situation where they get introduced to the same at a very late stage in life. In as much as the native English speakers are assumed to have an easier time with the English language, not everyone can claim to have mastery on the same. As a matter of fact, most of them speak the language without a proper consideration on the grammar and words work.

Depending on what are your preferences, you can choose to either learn the British or the American English versions which are the most popular. Other versions include: the Canadian version, the Australian and the New Zealand version to name but a few. All these versions are slightly different from one another in terms of their grammar rules and in some case the spelling of words. To a typical non-native, all these can be overwhelming and confusing at the same time. This makes it hard for anyone who is willing to learn the language. In fact, some people attribute their countless mistakes to having such disparities in the versions.

In this piece, we'll pay much of our attention to the Indian people as we try to explore some of the common mistakes they make in relation to the English language.

How is your fluency going?

Ever since I thought that I want to be a fluent English speaker, I tried every single possible technique to improve my vocabulary and fluency. Admit it or not, most of the non-natives start off on the wrong foot by trying traditional study methods such as learning few words from dictionary daily or be it when you tried a new language book to improve their vocabulary and fluency. The matter of the fact is, vocabulary and fluency go hand in hand while learning. Now you many wanna ask, if they go hand in hand, why do you say learning vocabulary from a dictionary is bad? It’s not bad; I would say it’s even worse. The fact is, dictionary was never made for learning purpose, it is
just for ‘referential purpose’, so in case if you get stucked while reading a book, blog or anything, you can refer to it for clear understanding of the topic. (more&hellip;)</p>	</div></a>

		 <h1>Common English Phrases to Use at Home &#038; With Kids</h1><p>



I got the inspiration to write this English phrase compilation from a guy called Guillermo, and here’s the comment he left on my blog a while back:



So basically he wants to learn useful English phrases to be used around the house describing common everyday concepts such as eating, playing, tidying up, going to bed and others.

And come to think of it, pretty much all English phrases I’ve published on this blog focus either on your social life such as the small talk phrases or your professional life such as these industry specific phrases.
That’s why I decided to compile a bunch of useful English phrases you can use at home when speaking with your own kinds in order to improve your English – just like Guillermo does – or when there’s other English speaking kids around.
Speaking of which, I can tell you based on my own experience that your English may be quite advanced, but you may still find yourself struggling to speak with little children using simple language :!:

I clearly remember how I came to Ireland all those years ago and my daughters started attending the local school.

I was in the same situation when I had to help them with their homework or speak with other kids at birthday parties, for example, and I realized that my English was lacking simple phraseology that native speakers use in daily situations at home!

So, without further ado, let’s start listing commonly used simple English expressions you’ll be able to use at home! ;-)
