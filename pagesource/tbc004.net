<strong>PLEASE READ:</strong>
As with ALL financial decisions, buying TBC coins carries a RISK!  Individual results vary widely from person to person within the TBC community, and no guarantees of “Real” financial gains are offered.  Buy TBC coins at your own risk!  That’s the short version of our DISCLAIMER.  To read the entire disclaimer, click on the DISCLAIMER button below--It is advised that before you become a Member of TBC or Open a TBC Wallet that you not only read the entire DISCLAIMER—YOU STUDY IT!
</p>
<p>
TBC is not a Market based coin—TBC does NOT have a Sell or Withdrawal button to click and easily Sell TBC/Kringle coins.  If you only want to deal with Market based crypto-currencies, then leave this website and go to
<a target="_blank" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">https://coinmarketcap.com/</a>
and you will NOT find TBC there!  Good Luck Trading.
</p>
<p>
TBC is a PEER to PEER Private Crypto-Currency.  Your efforts to expand our TBC community give you the opportunity to Sell TBC and to purchase goods and services using TBC/Kringle coins.  If you have any doubt in your own ability to promote TBC, but you still want to participate we strongly suggest you start your TBC experience by partnering up with a Trusted Seller of TBC and try to market TBC using their TBC/Kringle coins in order to begin with zero to little financial RISK to yourself.  Get back together with the TBC Member that invited you or conduct your search for a Trusted Seller by going here:
<a target="_blank" href="https://thebillioncoin.info/tbc_testimonials.php">https://thebillioncoin.info/tbc_testimonials.php</a>
</p>
<p>
Discounting TBC/Kringle coins is strictly prohibited!  All Buying and Selling of TBC/Kringle coins as well as exchanges for Goods and Services must be done at the Current Price only.  All large transactions will be investigated by a member of the Admin team.  Discounting TBC or even the attempt to Discount TBC will result in the SUSPENSION OF YOUR TBC WALLET.  We cannot enjoy the benefits of an “Abundance-based” currency and allow Discounting by any TBC member.  The two things conflict with each other, so get educated about that.
</p>
<p>
TBC Members are not allowed to be negative about TBC in Public, such as making a negative Facebook post or comment on any social media.  This is also a form of Discounting the TBC currency.  When a Member is caught doing such things other Members will report it as ABUSE to Admin and your Send button will be turned OFF for a period of time.  We are creating wealth at hyper speeds for all of our Members, and we will not allow ABUSE.  If you don’t like our policies and terms of conditions for our PRIVATE currency—aka OUR RULES—then please DON’T JOIN US!!!!!
</p>
<p class='warning-message'>
Buyers getting TBC coins at a discount will be suspended too!

<h2>TBC Coin</h2>
<p>
TBC coins are the most valuable currency in the world because they are the first “Abundance-Based” currency and during the wealth creation phase of our global currency roll out you have the opportunity to become Millionaires and Billionaires automatically from a single one-time purchase of TBC coins.  Kringles are the smallest change of TBC coins and most of the Community prefer to refer to the units of value in Kringles instead of TBC.  The main thing to understand is that we, by private agreement, will never let the price of our coins go down in value.  It is a very simple Membership Agreement, but it is the “secret sauce” of an “Abundance-Based” currency.

<h2>How to Buy and Sell</h2>
<p>
It doesn’t make sense to share abundance with someone that already has abundance.  So, it doesn’t make sense to sell TBC coins to an existing member that already has TBC coins.  There are thousands of us here as TBC members, but there are billions of them that are not yet receiving the abundance that comes from owning TBC coins.  Sell your TBC coins to them; invite and educate the people you are already connected with in the world outside, to join us on our quest to make this a better world for all, sharing in the abundance that comes from being a part of the TBC community.  If you have found us on your own, and haven’t been invited to join us by a friend of yours, then you can use our exchange to convert Bitcoin into TBC.  Simply follow the instructions in the Trade Guide.
