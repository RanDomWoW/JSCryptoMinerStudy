i break mirrors with my face in the united states<br />
everything rigged at this place its not me<br />
don&#039;t break my concentration with those thoughts baby<br />
i don&#039;t care about real life<br />
feel just like i look to you<br />
gawk at me all you see is you<br />
anyday trip mayday trip <br />
can&#039;t break my face i&#039;m in a state trip<br />
spit on you spit on me<br />
all we know spit must be us<br />
spit fits us we spit and sniff<br />
we sniff and clutch each other&#039;s fate<br />
i don&#039;t care about real life<br />
i break mirrors with my face in the united states<br />
too many mirrors share my face<br />
can&#039;t braillele which mirrors my mistake<br />
too many mirrors wear my face<br />
these broken mirrors take my place<br />
i don&#039;t care about real life<br />
too many mirrors share my face<br />
can&#039;t braille which mirrors my mistake<br />
i break mirrors with my face in the united states</p>

<p>inanimate sensation<br />
vantage perspective from objective it came from<br />
inanimate situation<br />
no relation close liaison <br />
no conversation no social contagion<br />
bother me wanna be comrade intrusive<br />
i remain inanimate aloof skip counterfeit like no can do bitch<br />
my vinyl vibrate higher than you bitch<br />
i represent ain&#039;t meant to pursue <br />
which one of you oh you all wanna ride well i ain&#039;t got room stress<br />
while we continue to make shit tight the loosest<br />
blown out <br />
base<br />
you got a minute <br />
you&#039;re in my way<br />
whats wrong <br />
wrong with who<br />
so whats going on<br />
okay<br />
where you at right now<br />
i&#039;m not with you<br />
inanimate persuasion<br />
strictly still life with all of my occasion<br />
inanimate surge of inspiration<br />
glow like thermonuclear invasion<br />
compared to swapping thoughts regurgitation<br />
i revel in lack of slightest acquaintance <br />
no rancid level after taste inanimate negate opinion<br />
as it unravel like enigmatic onion<br />
layers of interdimensional dominion<br />
blown out<br />
base<br />
yeah bitch <br />
my smoke my butane my boots <br />
my headphones my medicated noose<br />
my deadroom my schwartzwald hat my mac<br />
my macaque skull my lysergic stash<br />
empty streets at night my bike <br />
apartment sink filled with dry ice<br />
condemned tenement brandished rail spike<br />
disturb in flat noir and stale white<br />
grey cloud curled around my bearded compound like boa<br />
one of two thunderbolt we ain&#039;t broke on tour<br />
concrète antique trapdoor twenty-four <br />
spots to get that get right<br />
when i gotta get right some more<br />
type of get right i can&#039;t afford<br />
i covet these things more than any living<br />
i&#039;ve never been <br />
blown out<br />
base<br />
i&#039;m so northern california i call scratch bammer<br />
pure overhander<br />
live show on a banner<br />
axl rose in a blender<br />
slash on satan&#039;s fender<br />
rick james on the cover<br />
running through your lover<br />
like mean mr. mustard<br />
stadium style<br />
for those who came to jock<br />
watch that man salute you<br />
endless nameless lady godivas we snoop to<br />
like eighty-three mermaids in brooklyn zoo<br />
inanimate ghetto box we used to pimp through<br />
blown out<br />
base<br />
inanimate fixation<br />
obsessed with my demo tape collection<br />
inanimate riffs i&#039;m glazin<br />
brag your making music naw you&#039;re makin bacon<br />
skinhead skinhead inna dublin<br />

<p>my stone wall its on dog gaze duct taped to the ceiling<br />
stucco cave make me illi okay okay feel me<br />
I&#039;m in an eight high abandoned building<br />
no daylight one midnight lamp lit twenty-four seven<br />
murdered out windows two exits<br />
street or nosedive to the next life in seconds<br />
and suicide aint my stallion<br />
so I&#039;m surrounded<br />
geiger count it not goin out shit&#039;s bout ta get kamikaze<br />
fuck a nazi<br />
when the world comes knocking<br />
fuck the world fuck this body<br />
know it won&#039;t be long be now<br />
feel my nerves wet my brow<br />
mood in my tomb red moon heavy<br />
sling jaw shot out the window and yell<br />
come up and get me<br />
<br />
I&#039;m epiphanic amnesia<br />
I&#039;m in Jimmy Page&#039;s castle<br />
I&#039;m off the planet<br />
echo astral<br />
vinyl lasso<br />
the Sacto asshole<br />
I&#039;m not down for anything<br />
fuck around and say anything<br />

put your gun to my head<br />
I&#039;ll blow smoke in your face<br />
think you got what it takes<br />
come up and get me<br />
<br />
can&#039;t tell hell in my head<br />
thirteenth bell am I dead<br />
or in asylum pill force fed<br />
lyin to myself all by myself<br />
strapped down to my bed<br />
tongue cut out the mouth of reason<br />
and chucked off the rivers edge<br />
think fast is it tear gas or fear masked<br />
by figments of my fragmented mind<br />
who&#039;s my enemy them or me<br />
step to me and you&#039;ll die<br />
grand delusions magnified<br />
fuck the truth wastes my time<br />
its all good bet whats that<br />
footsteps on the stairs<br />
never could rest they&#039;re always there<br />
who are they I don&#039;t care<br />

<p>artificial death in the west east <br />
pyramids on deck shine <br />
wet hair on her neck breathe <br />
she shoot pussy through your chest you die <br />
<br />
there was a artificial death in the west east <br />
all pyramids on deck shine <br />
wet hair on her neck breathe <br />
g-o-d she shoot pussy through your chest you die <br />
<br />
where you runnin now <br />
<br />
I&#039;m barely there I&#039;m everywhere <br />
heavy thin air sahara mascara smeared end of an era <br />
tracks on Hera&#039;s peacock thighs china white skies ivory of my leper eyes <br />
tone of sighs off nylon lips <br />
where you runnin now <br />
in fish net wet guise of gimp horizon slit bled like my wrist I suck it dry <br />
which nipples mine read the signs still can&#039;t decide <br />
at your own risk at your own risk <br />
don&#039;t touch me bitch don&#039;t touch me bitch <br />
where you runnin now <br />
accustomed to these satin glitches drippin from my caskets inners <br />
charmer play me out the basket last image I saw was splintered <br />
my reflection wasn&#039;t in it in slow motion I give in <br />
where you runnin now where you runnin now <br />
hopeless premonitions <br />
tomorrow didn&#039;t come some say its hiding but they&#039;re the ones who&#039;ve hidden <br />
euphoria followed by visions of peasants eating pigeons <br />
where you runnin now where you runnin now <br />
<br />
there was a artificial death in the west east <br />
all pyramids on deck shine <br />
wet hair on her neck breathe <br />
g-o-d she shoot pussy through your chest you die <br />
<br />
where you runnin now <br />
<br />
watching me watching me watch them watch me <br />
<br />
hole in this platinum ship of fools nomadic rule concept no rules <br />
mobile shrine of this destitute wasteland mute <br />
screaming at me winking at me like I love it <br />
fucking wit me fuck it <br />
<br />
my star gate in a vacuum monitors eye view <br />
this valley is an urn this valley I&#039;m wading through <br />
where you runnin now <br />
feel like I&#039;m chasing after me feel like dead weight in a sea of vaseline <br />
all that can&#039;t be seen watching me watching me watch them watch me <br />
try not to dwell on my cell my empty shell shedding me <br />
where you runnin now <br />
artificial death in the west east <br />
pyramids on deck shine <br />
where you runnin now <br />
no matter where I turn shut down shut down <br />
everyones a runaway where you runnin now <br />
<br />
there was a artificial death in the west east <br />
all pyramids on deck shine <br />
wet hair on her neck breathe <br />
g-o-d she shoot pussy through your chest you die <br />

watching me watching me watch them watch me <br />

<div class="song-lyrics">
<p>I close my eyes and seize it<br />
I clench my fists and beat it<br />
I light my torch and burn it<br />
I am the beast I worship...<br />
<br />
And I know soon come my time<br />
For in mine void a pale horse burns<br />
But I fear not the time I&#039;m taken<br />
Past the point of no return.<br />
Wage war like no tomorrow<br />
Cuz no hell there won&#039;t be one<br />
For all who deny the struggle<br />
The triumphant overcome<br />
<br />
Trips to where, few have been<br />
Out of thin air, upon high winds<br />
Rites begin when the sun descends<br />
Have felt what few will ever know<br />
Have seen the truth beneath the glow,<br />
Of the ebb and flow, where roots of all mysteries grow<br />
I am below, so far below<br />
The bottom line<br />
Transmitting live, transmissions rise<br />
From the depths out of controlled by<br />
Suspended glance of an unblinking eyes<br />
Imminent gaze cast &#039;pon the path that winds<br />
&#039;Pon the path I find, and claim as mine<br />
To ride the waves, of unrest<br />
Made to make me shine as a testament<br />
To why the ways of the blind will never get<br />
Shit but shanked by my disrespect<br />
Dismiss this life, worship death<br />
Cold blood night of serpent&#039;s breath<br />
Exhaled like spells from the endlessness<br />
In the bottomless wells of emptiness<br />
Channeled to invoke what we represent<br />
<br />
Secret order<br />
Elitist horde of<br />
Creeping fire<br />
Seizing power<br />
Riders of the lupus hour<br />
Eye on palm<br />
Time is gone<br />
Moonlight drawn<br />
Fly til dawn<br />
Sacrifice to rise beyond<br />
Deep inside the violent calm<br />
Of the coming storm<br />
In blood sworn<br />
To glorify and for life adorn<br />
With all that dies to become unborn<br />
<br />
I close my eyes and seize it<br />
I clench my fists and beat it<br />
I light my torch and burn it<br />
I am the beast I worship...<br />
I am the beast I worship<br />
<br />
In the time before time eyes &#039;bove which horns<br />
Curve like psychotropic scythes<br />
And smell of torn flesh bled dry<br />
By hell swarms of pestis flies<br />
Vomiting forth flames lit by<br />
An older than ancient force<br />
That slays this life with no remorse<br />
<br />
The spiral storm<br />
Of flames inside<br />
The torch I raise<br />
The force I ride<br />
<br />
Feel my vessel go up in flames<br />
Flesh torch lit by thee unnamed<br />
Direct connection to the source<br />
Vestment of unnatural force<br />
Forever burning black torch<br />
Wisdom of the old and true<br />
Possessed by the chosen few<br />
Shining to reveal the ways<br />
Of a darkness that pervades<br />
All that is and ever was<br />
Inferno of witches blood<br />
<br />
Worship is not on bended knee<br />
Nature knows not of mercy<br />
To pray is to accept defeat<br />
Power pisses on the weak<br />
Bow and beheaded by the beast<br />
Beggar on a bitches leash<br />
Scum is desperate for relief<br />
Worship is the way I ride<br />
Witching currents through the eye<br />
Of storms that force the false to die<br />
Worship the flames with which I rise<br />
Into apocalyptic skies<br />
<br />
Harsh winds flay mine flesh to bone<br />
In splintered skeleton I roam<br />
Wastelands with not to call my own<br />
But the path I walk alone<br />
The hunger burns, within my gut<br />
As my bones turn into dust<br />
<br />
And I know soon come my time<br />
For in mine void a pale horse burns<br />
But I fear not the time I&#039;m taken<br />
Past the point of no return<br />
Wage war like no tomorrow, know well there wont we one<br />
For all who deny the struggle<br />
The triumphant overcome ...<br />
<br />
I close my eyes and seize it<br />
I clench my fists and beat it<br />
I light my torch and burn it<br />
I am the beast I worship...<br />
I am the beast I worship </p>

<div class="song-lyrics">
<p>It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes<br />
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes<br />
Guillotine - yah<br />
<br />
Sit in the dark and ponder how I&#039;m fit<br />
to make the bottom fall through the floor<br />
And they all fall down - yah<br />
<br />
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes...<br />
Guillotine - yah<br />
<br />
Out of the shadows barrage of witch tongue<br />
Cobra spit over apocalyptic cult killer cauldron smoke<br />
Stomp music seriously - yah<br />
<br />
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes...<br />
Guillotine - yah<br />
<br />
Can&#039;t stop the groove lics jaws clear off<br />
them locks relentless raw movement<br />
Fit to knock you from here to that g-spot body rock connected<br />
<br />
To everything you want, ever did want<br />
We got it why not come get it, stick your head in that hole<br />
And watch me drop this cold guillotine death sentence - yah<br />
<br />
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes...<br />
Guillotine - yah<br />
<br />
Hidden art, between and beneath, every fragmented, figure of speech,<br />
Tongue in reverse, whenever the beat, causes my jaws to call<br />
Out out out out - yah<br />
<br />
The screens flashing red, can&#039;t see shit but heads<br />
Spinning exorcist like planets<br />
Out of orbit off the edge<br />
Off mine axis whipping through doors to<br />
far more than all that&#039;s ever been said - yah<br />
<br />
Tie the chord kick the chair and your dead - yah<br />
<br />
Yah ... guillotine - yah ... guillotine - yah<br />
<br />
Head of a trick in a bucket<br />
Body of a trick in a bag<br />
And thrown in the fire like fuck it<br />
Gotta burn it before it goes bad<br />
One too many times been disgusted<br />
By the stench of rot is such a drag - yah<br />
<br />
Get broke by the street like blood stained glass - yah<br />
Choke on these nuts til the very last - yah<br />
<br />
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes...<br />
Guillotine - yah<br />
<br />
Serial number, killing machine<br />
The illest of means,<br />
To an end built on the filthy sound<br />
you&#039;re experiencing - yah<br />
<br />
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes...<br />
Guillotine - yah<br />
<br />
Tinted windows, bulletproof<br />
The slip knot fixin rope to noose<br />
To the grave stone grinder of cold steel<br />
<br />
The passion that blinds me so I feel - YAH<br />
<br />
Can&#039;t let go, no it flows through our veins<br />
Blows through our tunnels and rattles our chains<br />
And they all fall down - yah </p>

<div class="song-lyrics">
<p>I fuck the music<br />
I make it cum<br />
I fuck the music with my serpent tongue<br />
<br />
Wanna beer, have no fear, comes and goes, man its here<br />
No one knows, feels so weird, when it blows through my bones<br />
I got a jones for it<br />
I wanna know more, cuz its bout what I got to show for it<br />
<br />
I want some more of it<br />
I want too much<br />
I got so bored with it<br />
I shot it up<br />
Wanna light my torch with it and get all fucked up<br />
<br />
What is it, where is it<br />
How will it affect me<br />
Fuck that shit, I need that shits bound to be the death of me<br />
Fuck buying it I&#039;m taking it, and sharing it with nobody<br />
<br />
Cuz all I really need is some cool shit to mob<br />
Like driving down the street to the beat of a blow job<br />
<br />
I own that shit<br />
On some throw back shit<br />
You already know that shit<br />
You even know &#039;bout how I know the man<br />
Who grows that, bitch o<br />
<br />
You can&#039;t buy it with your money<br />
You can&#039;t find it overseas<br />
Its one of those things that seems outlandish<br />
Til you have it&#039;s not a dream<br />
As for me, I&#039;m cool with it<br />
And that&#039;s alright cuz it&#039;s my thing.<br />
<br />
Work that angle til its beveled<br />
Curve of the blade doubled<br />
Edge made to bleed the struggle<br />
Best believe the game&#039;s a hustle.<br />
Observer of the strange occurrences<br />
Conjurer of the subtle<br />
Unseen but felt disturbances<br />
That burst a bitches bubble<br />
<br />
That&#039;s right it&#039;s all mine<br />
It&#039;s all mine never was yours<br />
Like how you wait in line<br />
While I walk straight through the door<br />
(straight through the...)<br />
Hear you say something<br />
But ain&#039;t nothing ?spectators ignored<br />
Pay no mind to that chump&#039;s<br />
Just a player hatin whore<br />
<br />
I fuck the music<br />
I make it cum<br />
I fuck the music with my serpent tongue<br />
<br />
Ain&#039;t no fun if the aliens can&#039;t have none<br />
<br />
How I fuck it dirty<br />
How I make it twitch and scream<br />
How it screams oh baby hurt me<br />
Work me to the bone oh please<br />
How I bend the rhythm over<br />
And hit, hit, hit it on my knees<br />
Give, give, give it up<br />
I need it all the time<br />
Bleed it on the drop of a dime ?down to pound it til it shines<br />
Moonlit lake of blood red wine<br />
Make no mistake, I makes it mine<br />
<br />
Break shit down and make it grind<br />
To the groove used to align<br />
The cascading shades of jaded blues with these rhymes<br />
Nuclear steeze creeps and winds<br />
Through secrets behind and between<br />
Every time I scream<br />
<br />
Shit is mine<br />
Its all mine<br />
All the time<br />
Shit is mine<br />
<br />
What is it, where is it, how will it affect me<br />
Fuck that shit I need that shit<br />
<br />
Thought you knew, thought you thought<br />
Thought you did but did not<br />
Come on through what you got<br />
Is it cool is it hot?<br />
<br />
Check one two, man don&#039;t stop<br />
I&#039;m not through black blood clot<br />
In my view like that twat<br />
Spread eagle cross the block<br />
<br />
Need no ego to rock<br />
What we know just gets dropped<br />
How we keep shit on lock<br />
<br />
Cuz all I really need is some cool shit to mod<br />
Like driving down the street to the beat of a blow job<br />
<br />
Shit is mine<br />
Its all mine<br />
All the time<br />
Shit is mine</p>
</div><h3 class="song-title">Lord of the Game (ft. Mexican Girl)</h3>
<div class="song-lyrics">
<p>Into the flame, into the fire<br />
With no regard for a thing<br />
fuck that I&#039;m the lord of the game<br />
I rule this empire<br />
<br />
Lord of the game<br />
Born to reign above all<br />
that you claim to know beyond a doubt<br />
Cuz no one has came even close to the train<br />
Of thought we drop like<br />
neutron bombs from the tower<br />
<br />
Control this and bang this, then watch it rise higher<br />
Than anything seen in your entire<br />
Life spent in chains, sonic live wire<br />
Electrified rain from the lips of the driver<br />
Whippin the wheel<br />
Flippin donuts to peel<br />
Out on the face of the base, where&#039;s my lighter?<br />
Need it to kill one more and chill while I feel<br />
It so much my gut burns like the tires<br />
Movin this movement of real shit inspired<br />
By all that has come before this and was done<br />
For the real ones packin real guns loaded with power<br />
Shower the slums with power from the war marching drums that have come to devour<br />
The weakness that runs when we come<br />
Fuckin cowards<br />
<br />
When they tell you you must make it<br />
And you think hell no<br />
Got a bad feeling and can&#039;t shake it<br />
Hits so low<br />
<br />
Lord of the game<br />
Born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt<br />
Cuz no one has came even close to the train of thought<br />
We drop like neutron bombs from the tower<br />
&#039;Pon which we maintain<br />
Like soldiers of fame<br />
And fortune denied as to to get by without the<br />
Bullshit coming at me from all sides<br />
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide<br />
Told me it was all good, but they lied<br />
Don&#039;t wait to see whites of their eyes<br />
Death to everyone who does not recognize<br />
Wars never done, think it is you die<br />
<br />
Where was I now<br />
Like I said before<br />
Hear someone knockin<br />
At my front door<br />
Who could it be, should I ignore<br />
The knockin or see what could be in store<br />
For me if I leave the safety of the shore<br />
So many options, so little time<br />
To do what I want &#039;fore the end of the line<br />
Places its blade in the small of my spine<br />
Is it paranoia, is it real?<br />
How long can a man enjoy what he doesn&#039;t feel<br />
<br />
When they ask if you can make it<br />
And you don&#039;t wanna go<br />
<br />
When they tell you you must make it<br />
And you think hell no<br />
Got a bad feeling and can&#039;t shake it<br />
Hits so low<br />
<br />
(Rather be stuck naked)<br />
Than waste my time like the last time<br />
And every time before that<br />
Don&#039;t waste my time even one more time<br />
When you know that shit is whack<br />
Don&#039;t make me remind of you of the last time you<br />
Said you&#039;d never go back.<br />
<br />
Fuck where you&#039;re from,<br />
Fuck where you&#039;re goin,<br />
It&#039;s all about where you&#039;re at</p>
</div><h3 class="song-title">Takyon</h3>
<div class="song-lyrics">
<p>Triple six, five, forked tongue<br />
Subatomic penetration rapid fire through your skull<br />
How I shot it on one taking it back to the days of trying to lose control<br />
Swerving in a blaze of fire, raging through my bones<br />
Oh shit I&#039;m feeling it - Takyon<br />
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it - Takyon<br />
Alright that&#039;s tight, what its like to experience - Takyon<br />
<br />
Out of the blue, in through the back<br />
Door coming through like fuck what was that<br />
Man I don&#039;t know, but it made me feel so heated<br />
How we creep without showing you jack<br />
Shit from below, give a shit if you know<br />
Cuz even if you did, you&#039;d keep coming back<br />
Back for more, need it man you&#039;re addicted to the heat<br />
We make beats catch<br />
Beat it til it bleeds to death, each track<br />
Like EPMD snappin necks as we tap energy from everything on and off the map<br />
<br />
Oh shit I&#039;m feeling it - Takyon<br />
Hell yeah, fuck yeah I feel like killing it - Takyon<br />
Alright that&#039;s tight what its like to experience - Takyon<br />
<br />
Takyon, shot down your throat like a keg of beer<br />
Choke on the smoke we in and exhale til the whole chamber is clear<br />
Haters act so fucking weird<br />
Try to stain this atmosphere<br />
But they can&#039;t cuz its way too sheer<br />
How to make a hater disappear<br />
<br />
Take shit where it ain&#039;t never been<br />
Fuck what you thought could not comprehend<br />
This shit if I fisted your brain with it<br />
10-9-8-7-triple 6-5-forked tongue<br />
Criminal level crunk lightning storm<br />
Get out the way or get up torn<br />
Ain&#039;t a picture big enough to fit<br />
What we dig up from the core<br />
Of all that they forgot ever was<br />
Militant march of this war<br />
<br />
Takyon - taking them down<br />
All we see is blood<br />
Takyon - turning them out<br />
How to trick out and freak that buzz<br />
<br />
Oh shit I&#039;m feeling it - Takyon<br />
Hell yeah, fuck yeah I feel like killing it - Takyon<br />
Alright that&#039;s tight what its like to experience - Takyon<br />
<br />
Lunar eclipse forcing you to trip<br />
Off the moonlit fire we spray<br />
Cryonic haunted bullets hollow tipped with toxic waste<br />
So here&#039;s the deal, if you don&#039;t feel ill<br />
Don&#039;t want it nowhere near my zone<br />
That shit is dead, can&#039;t nobody get<br />
With that shit gets dial toned<br />
<br />
Takyon - bitch slappin pussy clots and clones<br />
Takyon - settin off unibombs inside your dome<br />
<br />
Oh shit I&#039;m feeling it - Takyon<br />
Hell yeah, fuck yeah I feel like killing it - Takyon<br />
Alright that&#039;s tight what its like to experience - Takyon</p>

Best get rid of that quick<br />
Cuz when they get here you know what they&#039;re gonna do<br />
All they ever do is trip<br />
<br />
Six feet deep below the street<br />
So they can&#039;t never say shit again<br />
Fuck the man with a thick broomstick<br />
And put a black flag on the end<br />
<br />
Got to watch my back or just like that<br />
I&#039;m bound to get locked up<br />
The law&#039;s watching me, constantly<br />
Too close and way too much<br />
Looking over my shoulder and checking in the rear view mirror<br />
Cuz I&#039;m never not but a moment from getting taken to jail<br />
<br />
They&#039;re knocking at my door, down my door<br />
They&#039;re shining lights in my eyes<br />
Exactly what do they stand for<br />
Ever asking more of I man why<br />
Like it matters why I chose to ignore<br />
All the laws I&#039;ve been told to abide<br />
<br />
Think I&#039;m on parole, thinking I just stole<br />
Some shit you got an A.P.B out on but no<br />
You&#039;re wrong as usual hell no it wasn&#039;t me<br />
Have the nerve to ask me if I&#039;m drunk when I&#039;m pissing in the middle of the street<br />
<br />
Looking over my shoulder...<br />
<br />
By the way why they always acting<br />
Like they know how to size me up<br />
Ignorant bastards coming after me<br />
All the time on mine had enough.<br />
Why they always wanna hassle me, pigs all up on my nuts<br />
Like they have to be, like I can&#039;t see em<br />
Trying to play shade tree in the cuts<br />
<br />
By robbing me of my dignity<br />
So in the end I never say much<br />
But ain&#039;t a time pass I don&#039;t wish I could flash<br />
On penelope like fuck!<br />
<br />
Shot this for everyone who&#039;s been there<br />
For my real ones who understand<br />
<br />
What it feels like to have your rights read to you by the ...</p>

<div class="song-lyrics">
<p>Culture shock, future shock<br />
Fuck yourself, choke yourself<br />
<br />
Useless information occupies every open space inside your skull<br />
You know whats going on every day every night<br />
Everywhere swear you&#039;re so international<br />
<br />
Upside down cross on the Jumbotron<br />
Wait up, hold on<br />
Blowing anthrax off my palms<br />
Say what, you&#039;re wrong<br />
<br />
Switch stance, face plant<br />
Napalm fire starters<br />
Flatlander, plug puller<br />
Nose dive turbulence chartered<br />
<br />
You speak in abbreviations because real life conversation moves too slow<br />
You&#039;re the media&#039;s creation, yeah your free will has been taken and you don&#039;t know<br />
Choke yourself, fuck yourself<br />
<br />
Culture shock, future shock<br />
Fuck yourself, choke yourself<br />
<br />
Never seen without one hundred<br />
She&#039;s a satanic priestess<br />
Anarchy on ice freak flag flying faceless elitist<br />
Crow on the down low end<br />
Reppin&#039; Orion&#039;s belt<br />
Atlantis ancient vagina<br />
Getting dusty on the shelf<br />
Enter the pigs don&#039;t get it<br />
No hands I&#039;m shattering jaws<br />
Double nickles on the dime<br />
Fuck glam can lick my balls<br />
<br />
Culture shock, future shock<br />
Fuck yourself, choke yourself<br />
<br />
Whatchya gonna be when you&#039;re grown young blood?<br />
Gonna be a mindless drone<br />
Won&#039;t ever have to think<br />
No your head&#039;ll be linked directly to your cell phone<br />
The virus is alive, I can see it in your eyes<br />
The infection is full blown<br />
<br />
Career killer, double decker packed with suicidal brides<br />
Four armed fury in a filthy dream about splitting your bitches thighs<br />
Enters through unknowing eyes<br />
Touch the key its in your mind<br />
Can&#039;t delete it and soon you&#039;ll find<br />
How bad you need it all the time<br />
<br />
Culture shock, future shock<br />
Fuck yourself, choke yourself<br />
<br />
Shiva slashin through your flat screen<br />
Is nowhere for you to hide<br />
Strangled by anaconda thumbs to the soundtrack of world genocide<br />
My thoughts tie knots in silver spoons<br />
Vampire on the rise<br />
Punk a chump wit a cunt for brains platoon<br />
In the zone and on the grind<br />
<br />
Dead matter disposer from the mountains without peaks<br />
Catch and release<br />
Time released horse capsule swallowed to wake the savage beast<br />
<br />
Culture shock, future shock<br />
Fuck yourself, choke yourself<br />
<br />
Gotta get them outta here now<br />
Infected act so weird how&#039;d you get it<br />
You&#039;re pathetic<br />
Quarantine the virus<br />

Culture shock, future shock<br />
Fuck yourself, choke yourself</p>
</div><h3 class="song-title">Thru the Walls</h3>
<div class="song-lyrics">
<p>I&#039;m coming through, thought you knew, fuck if you didn&#039;t, fuck you<br />
Plutonium lore<br />
What this is, what this for<br />
Feel my fists push black holes<br />
Through your bitch ass decor<br />
Split it back like a whore<br />
And make you shit your fucking drawers<br />
<br />
Scared to ride, cowards fall<br />
Before my eyes, sound of my balls<br />
Dragging like cannon loaded wagons<br />
Drug by demons down your halls<br />
<br />
Can&#039;t imagine whats fit to happen<br />
When I get to flashing, see the small<br />
Shrink to a fraction of what their lacking<br />
And less than that in no time at all.<br />
Can&#039;t believe they have the gaul<br />
To try and act like they&#039;re not trapped<br />
Between these walls ...<br />
<br />
Bring it, bring it, bring it, kill it<br />
<br />
Bring it, bring that shit heated<br />
Sling it, bring back that shit - kill it<br />
<br />
Sometimes feel like I&#039;m close but never get there<br />
NEVER GET THERE<br />
Does it mean I&#039;m a ghost if I&#039;m still here?<br />
WANNA LEAVE HERE<br />
And if I am why can&#039;t I just float through the walls?<br />
THROUGH THE WALLS<br />
And if I can, were they even ever there at all?<br />
NOT AT ALL<br />
<br />
Too much time spent in the maze will drive you mad, I feel so bad<br />
Been there so long I can&#039;t remember who I am, or where I stand<br />
But in the end I guess I just don&#039;t give a damn<br />
Twist a gram and keep on sticking with the original plan<br />
Fuck it man<br />
<br />
Judge you no more than I wish to be judged<br />
Even on the low<br />
But I do know what you do not speak of<br />
Don&#039;t know but it shows<br />
Try to hide but I see who you are because<br />
I just know<br />
Keep talking but you already said too much<br />
There you go<br />
<br />
How it is now&#039;s how it it always was<br />
That&#039;s on my blood<br />
How it is now&#039;s how it it always was<br />
That&#039;s on my blood<br />
<br />
Bring it, bring that shit heated<br />
Sling it, bring back that shit - kill it<br />
<br />
See my blood spill drip, by chances<br />
Try to chill, quit, cuz I can&#039;t just slip into a zagthoth trance<br />
Tongue hissing, serpent chants<br />
Come again work it in, yeah just like that<br />
<br />
We paint our insides black<br />
As the shadows &#039;hind our flesh<br />
And make all that we lack<br />
The part of life that we forget<br />
All praise due to the fact<br />
That we&#039;ve forgotten how to sweat it<br />
Check it<br />
Bring it<br />
KILL IT<br />
<br />
On everything I own<br />
Swear would rather slit my throat and die on the run<br />
Than be the one who ends up hangin from that rope<br />
Tied to the thumb of the man who comes to empty your pockets when you choke<br />
Got to get that shit myself and get the fuck out of this game<br />
Before I end up getting stuck with no one but myself to blame<br />
All the way insane<br />
<br />
Staring at the ceiling<br />
In the dark<br />
Trying not to let the feeling<br />
Tear you apart<br />
But the silence is buzzing<br />
And it won&#039;t stop<br />
Tell yourself its almost over<br />
But its not </p>
</div><h3 class="song-title">Known for it</h3>
<div class="song-lyrics">
<p>Known for it.. known for it<br />
<br />
Known for it, been through it<br />
Done everything I can to it<br />
Road to it, til I broke through it<br />
Never was attached to it<br />
Took all I had in a flash knew it was bout ta crash<br />
So I mashed through hit<br />
Known for it<br />
Had ta do it<br />
Hacked into it<br />
<br />
I pay the price ta roll wit it<br />
Waste your life and you wont get it<br />
Played out wit nowhere ta go bet it<br />
Makes you feel like a ho don&#039;t it?<br />
Don&#039;t it.. Known for it<br />
<br />
Let it eat shit and die<br />
As I creep lit<br />
Off the deep hits wit a sick mind<br />
On the secrets I rely &#039;pon ta freak this<br />
<br />
You can tell me what you said - go ahead<br />
But no sooner than you said it,<br />
You can bet it was left for dead<br />
All you said in and out of my head in seconds<br />
<br />
Keep em guessin endlessly<br />
Never let em know where your headed<br />
King of the unknown cloaked in mystery<br />
How ta show em they don&#039;t mean shit ta me<br />
<br />
Never meant a thing to me<br />
Effortlessly dead to me<br />
Check the sign no vacancy<br />
Extremely selective memory<br />
<br />
Known for it, gotta stay deep in the zone<br />
Or it&#039;ll take everything you own, floor it<br />
Get it, get it<br />
<br />
I pay the price ta roll wit it<br />
Waste your life and you wont get it<br />
Played out wit nowhere ta go bet it<br />
Makes you feel like a ho don&#039;t it?<br />
Don&#039;t it.. Known for it<br />
<br />
Let it eat shit and die<br />
As I creep lit<br />
Off the deep hits wit a sick mind<br />
On the secrets I rely &#039;pon ta freak this<br />
<br />
Known for it since way back, all about it<br />
Never been without it<br />
How ta ride it inside out of da clouded<br />
By the enemy surrounded<br />
Thoughts that make you feel lost don&#039;t doubt it<br />
You might just need it<br />
<br />
Already did that,<br />
Can&#039;t never go back<br />
Yeah fuck that<br />
Gets the bozack<br />
<br />
Laid on the gas, leaned back and blew it<br />
Twelve gauge blasted out abused it<br />
Left it for the next, hit eject done wit that<br />
You want it you can have it, no questions asked<br />
Left that shit on the side of the road in a ditch, don&#039;t trip<br />
If ya have one let a man so I could flip a bitch and kill it<br />
<br />
Head for the hills when it makes you feel<br />
Like you can&#039;t ever chill no more, fuck it<br />
Every time I get it ta wind, round my finger and recline<br />
Behave or be slayed cuz I will be damned if mine ever decays<br />
<br />
Forever on attack gut check the blind<br />
<br />
Game recognize game is tight<br />
Bow down or get banged for life<br />
<br />
Cuz I.. am.. known for it</p>
</div><h3 class="song-title">I want it I need it (Death Heated)</h3>
<div class="song-lyrics">
<p>Been working way too much need to get out and get fucked up<br />
Whats going on, where&#039;s it at<br />
Make some calls to make it crack, lets see...<br />
I need money, drugs, a ride<br />
And a spot with hot ones inside<br />
The mission:<br />
To get all of the above in a limited amount of time<br />
I can do this and it&#039;s done<br />
Like that we&#039;re on our way<br />
<br />
Be it acid on the tongue<br />
Cocaine in your brain<br />
Or some weed that hits your lungs<br />
Like a runaway train<br />
Hell yeah, from DMT to MDMA<br />
Got all that shit and more<br />
So &#039;til dawn we&#039;re okay... but anyway..<br />
<br />
Fuck a line, every time<br />
Get in, get a drink and lose our minds<br />
All eyes on the dime<br />
That makes your dick want to grind<br />
Know you got a godd buzz going<br />
Cuz everything is glowing<br />
Skirt so short her ass is showing<br />
And shes looking so you&#039;re knowing<br />
You could get it tonight<br />
But there&#039;s so much around<br />
Best take your time do it right<br />
<br />
As you keep getting higher<br />
Lights look like they&#039;re on fire<br />
Soon all that&#039;s left of you<br />
Is your most primal desires<br />
<br />
Ass clappin, dick suckin, lock the door to the bathroom ?quick fuckin<br />
Find a whore and it could happen<br />
But it&#039;s nothin, cuz you&#039;re drunk and you&#039;ll be blackin out<br />
Before you even get a chance to think bout what you&#039;re doing<br />
<br />
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated<br />
Shake it, can&#039;t take it, must break it<br />
Break if off yea, what&#039;d I say bitch..<br />
Bitch<br />
<br />
Getting looser and looser and losing yourself<br />
In the groove that has the whole party movin<br />
You&#039;re cruisin, you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re doing and you don&#039;t give a<br />
Cuz you&#039;re so liquored up, you throw it up<br />
And keep on riding cuz your timing is on<br />
And that fine one is on you, its time to get gone<br />
Too far up in it to yawn, til its finished come on<br />
Get more twisted and bomb the dance floor til it breaks<br />
Start to pondering rape<br />
Me I&#039;m all bout the face<br />
But it takes all kinds<br />
So pay no mind to the taste<br />
Want to hear that song<br />
You know the one with the bass<br />
That makes their asses gyrate<br />
Forget to hydrate<br />
Til they&#039;re so fucked up they take<br />
Off all of their clothes and whip<br />
It on me like my body&#039;s made to fit &#039;tween their lips<br />
You got the ones on their grill<br />
Or between their hips<br />
But either way I must say<br />
I really don&#039;t give a shit<br />
Long as its done well, and they promise not to tell<br />
We could do this like an orgy<br />
In the bowels of hell<br />
Where every Lucy&#039;s hella horny<br />
And their pussies don&#039;t smell<br />
<br />
Argh... where&#039;s it at<br />
<br />
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated<br />
Shake it, can&#039;t take it, must break it<br />
Break if off yea, what&#039;d I say bitch..<br />
Bitch<br />
<br />
Responsibility&#039;s cool, but there&#039;s more things in life<br />
Like getting your dick<br />
Rode all fucking night<br />
By the kind of girl that knows how to keep her shit tight<br />
Legs in the air, looking like they feel nice<br />
Volcano pussy melt your peter like ice<br />
And the drugs got you going back for more cuz you&#039;re like<br />
I just can&#039;t get enough of that cum clutch, well alright<br />
<br />
Its time to find one and take one<br />
Right now<br />
Its time to find one and make one say<br />
I&#039;m down<br />
Think I just found one, bout to break one off<br />
Meanwhile...<br />
<br />
Hallucinating crazy, getting lost for miles,<br />
May have gotten too fucked up cuz I forgot how to smile<br />
Gonna have to do this shit Jim Morrison style<br />
Will it work? Probably not, but its worth a try<br />
<br />
First hot one I see with sex in her eyes<br />
Will be the hot one I need to take home with me tonight<br />
Wish me luck, give me dap<br />
And I&#039;ll talk to you later<br />
And when I do lets hope my story isn&#039;t all about haters<br />
<br />
Wheres it at, cuz I want it like man<br />
Got the drugs but need a hot one that&#039;ll make me go damn<br />
Was the most banging guts that I ever have smashed<br />
If you got it push it up on me cuz I&#039;m feeling that ass, know what I mean?<br />
Wheres it at?<br />
<br />
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated<br />
Shake it, can&#039;t take it, must break it<br />
Break if off yea, what&#039;d I say bitch..<br />
Bitch </p>
</div><h3 class="song-title">Blood Creepin</h3>
<div class="song-lyrics">
<p>Pass that shit<br />
<br />
Hold on man park the car<br />
I have no idea where we are<br />
Think we may have drove too far<br />
Yeah I can see they&#039;re right behind us<br />
But there&#039;s nothing we can do<br />
We can&#039;t get caught slipping get off that shit and just be cool ... ooooh<br />
<br />
They&#039;re on to us but don&#039;t look now<br />
They think they&#039;re bout to take us down<br />
Fuck that I&#039;m not going out<br />
At the next corner turn left<br />
Its time to handle this<br />
<br />
I know where to go don&#039;t trip<br />
Have no time for that pussy shit<br />
In a minute it&#039;ll all be finished<br />
What you don&#039;t think I speak the truth<br />
You think I could just be sitting here<br />
Listening to Sonic Youth?<br />
<br />
Anyway when they try to ride<br />
On you thinking I&#039;m gone<br />
I&#039;ll creep up on them from behind<br />
And break them off one by one<br />
And in the time it takes you to blink your eyes<br />
Shit&#039;ll already be done<br />
But just in case anything goes wrong<br />
Keep your right hand on your ... oohh<br />
<br />
So when they step up out the car<br />
Yeah I know this sounds bizarre<br />
But now I remember where we are<br />
Do what I say and you&#039;ll be fine .. oohh<br />
<br />
To the left of the off ramp, in the shade<br />
Under the highway, digging graves<br />
Blood creepin while you&#039;re sleepin<br />
Steady creepin, blood creepin<br />
<br />
Shake the bottle, whats it hold<br />
How many have I already sold<br />
Hope not too much, cuz I feel insane<br />
Need more than one to numb the pain<br />
<br />
Slithering through my brain<br />
Thoughts stuck on that train<br />
Off the track and up in flames<br />
<br />
Fuck it I&#039;ll swallow these blue ones<br />
Yeah and maybe this big one<br />
And I may as well take a few more with me<br />
Just in case I get some ... oohh<br />
Never know if they&#039;re gonna want some<br />
Oh you want one? Yeah no problem<br />
Got that covered tramp, I brought &#039;em ... oooh<br />
<br />
How it creeps up on me so slowly<br />
I don&#039;t notice my eyes rolling<br />
To the back of my head and falling<br />
Shit, somebody&#039;s calling<br />
Can&#039;t answer the phone<br />
Call them back when I&#039;m &#039;bout to leave<br />
Can&#039;t think straight man I&#039;m so fucking blown... ooohh<br />
<br />
So when they step up out the car<br />
Yeah I know this sounds bizarre<br />
But now I remember where we are<br />
Do what I say and you&#039;ll be fine .. oohh<br />
<br />
To the left of the off ramp, in the shade<br />
Under the highway, digging graves<br />
Blood creepin while you&#039;re sleepin<br />
Steady creepin, blood creepin<br />
<br />
Down the alleys in the middle of the night<br />
I&#039;m trashed, so high its hard to ride my bike<br />
Might crash, whenever I&#039;m this fucked up<br />
Drunken monkey through the cuts<br />
Who gives a fuck<br />
<br />
So when they step up out the car<br />
Yeah I know this sounds bizarre<br />
But now I remember where we are<br />
Do what I say and you&#039;ll be fine .. oohh<br />

To the left of the off ramp, in the shade<br />
