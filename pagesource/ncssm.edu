Carolina Governor James B. Hunt Jr.; former North Carolina governor, senator and Duke University president Terry Sanford; and academician and author John Ehle — envisioned an institution that would invest in the state&#39;s human and intellectual capital to build leadership and economic progress.\n\n\nIn 1980, during Governor Hunt&#39;s first administration, North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics opened on the grounds of the former Watts Hospital in Durham with 150 high school juniors. It was the first school of its kind — a public, residential high school welcoming students from across the state to study a specialized curriculum emphasizing science and mathematics but also offering humanities courses, athletics, and extracurricular opportunities.\n\n\nThe founders&#39; early vision has matured into a vital institution that models and advocates for excellence in public education. In 2007, the school became the 17th constituent of the University of North Carolina system. \nNCSSM Alumni \nOpening opportunities for students from every corner of our state\n\n\nEach year we enroll talented students from all 13 congressional districts and nearly each of North Carolina&#39;s 100 counties. \nEvolving into an online resource and partner to teachers, school districts\n\n\nWe began as a residential school, but we&#39;ve grown to be so much more. During the 2014-2015 academic year, for the first time, more students were enrolled in NCSSM Online (720) than in our residential program (680). We also offer courses, professional development, and other resources for teachers and school districts across the state. \nNationally recognized, internationally admired\n\n\nFor nearly 15 years, Newsweek has ranked NCSSM as a top public high school in the country. The Washington Post also categorizes NCSSM as one of the top-performing high schools nationwide. A number of schools globally have modeled themselves after our school. \nProving North Carolina students can compete and win globally\n\n\nWithin the last 5 years, NCSSM students have won or placed in the Singapore International Mathematics Challenge, Conrad Spirit of Innovation Award, Moody’s Mathematics Challenge, and scores of other contests — a good sign for our state&#39;s economy and future. \nCultivating community, offering\n\nreal-world learning experiences\n\n\nWe require all students to complete 60 hours of service with a North Carolina nonprofit before their senior year. We also encourage internships, mentorships, and other opportunities to be engaged in real-world learning experiences. \nA young school evolves:\n\ntimeline of key dates\n\n\n1978 \n\nThe North Carolina General Assembly establishes the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics to provide challenging educational opportunities for students with special interests and potential in the sciences and mathematics.\n\n\n1980 \n\nFirst class of 150 juniors enters the school, on the grounds of the former Watts Hospital in Durham\n\n\n1988 \n\nTogether with peers at a handful of similar schools, NC School of Science and Math leaders helps found the National Consortium of Specialized Secondary Schools of Math, Science and Technology, now the National Consortium of Secondary STEM Schools\n\n\n1994 \n\nNCSSM offers its first distance education classes, broadcasting on public television channels\n\n\n2007 \n\nNCSSM becomes the 17th constituent institution of the University of North Carolina system\n\n\n2008 \n\nFirst cohort, the Class of 2010, enters NCSSM Online, earning certificates of completion by supplementing their education at local high schools with virtual courses\n\n\n2011\n\nNCSSM sets the Guinness world record for largest food drive in single location in 24 hours, collecting 559,885 pounds of food to benefit the Food Bank of Central &amp; Eastern North Carolina, which serves 34 counties in our state.\n\n\n  \n8,200 alumni\n\n\nOur alumni are making an impact in wide-ranging fields — as leaders in the sciences, technology, education, business, the arts and more, across North Carolina and beyond. Meet a few of them here.\n\n\nLearn about some of them here \nInnovation: It&#39;s in our school&#39;s DNA.\n\n\nOur school&#39;s three founders — former North Carolina Governor James B.

Applicants are asked to rank the courses for which they are applying and about their interest and experience with the course topic on the application.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What are the admissions criteria?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Applications are scored by a committee that considers many factors in order to admit students who will succeed in the program. The reviewers look at self-reported GPA, passion for subject area, quality of writing, behavior and conduct, and experience in the subject area (if opportunities are available). The student portion of the application must be completed and written by the student.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When will I learn if I&#39;m accepted?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Students will be notified about their acceptance two to three weeks after submitting their application.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Students in the NCSSM Online program are eligible for tuition awards. They should fill out the online application and will be notified of their acceptance in two to three weeks. Any NCSSM Online student who is accepted will receive an award.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;How much does the program cost?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tuition for Early Accelerator is $1,495. Tuition for Accelerator is $1,925.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tuition includes room and board for the on-campus portion of the course (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks), as well as shuttle transportation from the airport, bus, or train station if needed. Tuition does not include transportation to and from Durham, North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once a participant has been accepted into the program, a non-refundable deposit of $250 is due within seven days of acceptance to reserve the student’s spot. Those who register and pay in full by February 15, 2018, will receive a $100 discount. Final payment of tuition is due April 1st, 2018. &lt;strong&gt;Tuition is due within two weeks of acceptance for anyone who applies and is accepted after April 1st, 2018.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Discounts are available for students who register for two or more weeks over the same summer and for siblings who are both accepted and register for courses. Discounts are also available for families that refer new students who enroll in the program.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I am a current NCSSM Online Student?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Students in the Online Program at NCSSM ae eligible for tuition awards. Those who submit their application by March 1, 2018,  will be notified of their acceptance by March 15, 2018. After March 15th, Onine students are still eligible to apply and will be notified of acceptance on a rolling basis. The award covers full tuition, room, and board. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Is there financial aid available?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial aid applications for summer 2018 are now closed as all funding has been awarded.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, any student in the United States who has been accepted to the Summer Accelerator program may apply for financial aid by completing a FACTS Aid Assessment for a $30 fee. FACTS assessment fees for North Carolina students who are eligible for reduced-price meals in the National School Lunch Program will be paid by Accelerator. Students in North Carolina whose families are eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and/or free meals in the National School Lunch Program may apply for a full financial aid scholarship for our summer programs without doing the FACTS assessment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We will award financial aid to at least ten eligible students in 2018. &lt;strong&gt;To apply for aid, please fill out the same application and indicate that you are applying for aid&lt;/strong&gt;. Once accepted to Summer Accelerator, we will provide details about applying for financial aid. At that point, applicants can choose to complete the FACTS assessment to apply for financial aid or send proof of SNAP or free/reduced-price meals to summer@ncssm.edu in order to be considered for aid. The student&#39;s spot will be held without a deposit during the financial aid application process, and a deposit will be due one week after the assessment depending on aid amount.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are seeking funding to expand our financial aid to families in need and will announce any expansion of financial aid through email to those subscribed to our mailing list. You can &lt;a href=\"http://eepurl.com/_K6UD\"&gt;subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We also highly recommend the &lt;a href=\"http://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/young-scholars/\"&gt;Jack Kent Cooke Young Scholars&lt;/a&gt; program.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When is the deadline to apply?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Applications are accepted until courses begin. We will accept students until each course is full and, after that, add accepted applicants to a waitlist. We recommend applying early as courses do fill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What if I have to cancel?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cancellations prior to 60 days before the start of the online portion of the course will receive a full tuition refund, minus the $250 deposit. Cancellations between 60 and 15 days before the start of the online portion of the course will receive 50% of the tuition refunded less the deposit. Cancellations within 15 days before the start of the online portion of the course will not receive a refund.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the case that the minimum requirements for running the program are not met, we reserve the right to cancel a course at any time, and will provide registered participants a full refund, including the deposit amount.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;"},{"widget":true,"editView":"1","type":"gallery","id":"w99761273758005036","ids":[],"extras":{},"showTitles":false,"showDescriptions":false,"showCredits":false,"_id":7,"_items":[]}],"type":"area"},"main_120306435584331099_col1":{"slug":"/summer-programs/accelerator/admissions:main_120306435584331099_col1","items":[{"editView":"1","widget":true,"type":"gallery","id":"w161234963891207455","ids":["530674918211819092","74237314691456712","484939528296202837","187226285716446425","309577372809013257","209507311838526013","246351325965970652","737429830492408687","874529856142563653","466532093864163527","58643441590260142","336482672677792055"],"extras":{"530674918211819092":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false},"74237314691456712":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false},"484939528296202837":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false},"187226285716446425":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false},"309577372809013257":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false,"crop":{"top":96,"left":306,"width":1713,"height":1239}},"209507311838526013":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false},"246351325965970652":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false},"737429830492408687":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false},"874529856142563653":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false},"466532093864163527":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false},"58643441590260142":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false},"336482672677792055":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false}},"showTitles":false,"showDescriptions":false,"showCredits":false,"_id":1,"_items":[{"_id":"530674918211819092","length":null,"group":"images","createdAt":"2015-10-20T13:58:03.386Z","name":"accel1","title":"accel1","extension":"jpg","md5":"f39acead55535043ebf08875b8ea5846","width":2588,"height":1848,"searchText":"accel1

Jack Kent Cooke Foundation in Lansdowne, Virginia, has awarded a two-year, $100,000 grant to North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics to enhance middle-school mathematics instruction in Northampton County, North Carolina. NCSSM will partner with Northampton County Schools to develop and deliver a high school level integrated mathematics course via interactive videoconferencing to approximately 25 low-income, high-achieving eighth-grade students in each year of the grant. Ultimately, this course and related materials will be available online, free of charge, to schools across the state.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;“We especially have to perform better in math.” —&lt;em&gt;Northampton County Schools Superintendent Monica Smith-Woofter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Located in northeastern North Carolina along the Virginia border, the economically distressed Northampton County has a history of low student performance on state assessments. For the past two years, student scores have been lower than the state’s overall composite scores.

Carolina Governor James B. Hunt Jr.; former North Carolina governor, senator and Duke University president Terry Sanford; and academician and author John Ehle — envisioned an institution that would invest in the state&#39;s human and intellectual capital to build leadership and economic progress.\n\n\nIn 1980, during Governor Hunt&#39;s first administration, North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics opened on the grounds of the former Watts Hospital in Durham with 150 high school juniors. It was the first school of its kind — a public, residential high school welcoming students from across the state to study a specialized curriculum emphasizing science and mathematics but also offering humanities courses, athletics, and extracurricular opportunities.\n\n\nThe founders&#39; early vision has matured into a vital institution that models and advocates for excellence in public education. In 2007, the school became the 17th constituent of the University of North Carolina system. \nNCSSM Alumni \nOpening opportunities for students from every corner of our state\n\n\nEach year we enroll talented students from all 13 congressional districts and nearly each of North Carolina&#39;s 100 counties. \nEvolving into an online resource and partner to teachers, school districts\n\n\nWe began as a residential school, but we&#39;ve grown to be so much more. During the 2014-2015 academic year, for the first time, more students were enrolled in NCSSM Online (720) than in our residential program (680). We also offer courses, professional development, and other resources for teachers and school districts across the state. \nNationally recognized, internationally admired\n\n\nFor nearly 15 years, Newsweek has ranked NCSSM as a top public high school in the country.
