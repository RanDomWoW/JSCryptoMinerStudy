Throughout the history of Tomb Raider, Lara Croft has been equal parts icon and iconoclast, from the original games to the reboot, Tomb Raider 2018 and its sequels Rise of the Tomb Raider and the newly announced Shadow of the Tomb Raider, which, from the very first trailer, made it clear that they were using the 2013 Tomb Raider games as a base. The new Tomb Raider, Alicia Vikander, joins Lara Croft Angelina Jolie as the second big screen Lara Croft. Alicia Vikander seems up to the task, and with the rebooted Lara Craft as her guide, she\u2019s ushered in a new era of female badassery that the entire gaming world can be proud of. So if you\u2019re a gamer, a movie fan or love seeing women kick ass on the big screen, this cool reboot should definitely be on your radar. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n","is_closed":false,"byline":"","title":"Tomb Raider: How Lara Croft Left the '90s Behind","apple_news_today_b":true,"data_s":"[]","primary_vertical":{"tid":4800131,"name":"Nerd","url":"nerd","display_name":"Nerd","color_name":"nerd","icon_name":""},"is_published":true,"apple_news_title_s":"","taxonomy":{"tags_tim":["nerd","lara croft","tomb raider","video games","gaming"],"reporting-category_tim":["Editorial"],"vertical_tim":["Nerd"],"company_tim":["NowThis"]},"top_stories":true,"video_source_si":"jwplayer","body_orig":"<p><span><span><span>From the video games to the big screen, Tomb Raider's Lara Croft has continued to evolve with the changing cultural landscape.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnd now Lara Croft is raiding theaters once again, so Andrew Rivera is here with a look at how this video-game icon evolved with the changing cultural landscape.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe new Tomb Raider movie&nbsp;is a landmark moment in the movie's history.

Evans says the Internet has a feminist hsitroy. \r\n\r\n\u201cWomen invented the mechanisms that set forward the development of programming from a brute operation to an art form.\u201d The author of \u201cBoard Band explained. \u201cThere is nothing inherently about a computer. A Computer is a machine. It\u2019s just something that pushes symbols around. There\u2019s lots of incredible punks and funny geniuses and pioneers and innovators and technologists and coders and gamers and really all kinds of amazing women who contributed to the development of computing. Some of my favorites include Ada Lovelace, who was the daughter of a romantic poet. She wrote the first computer programs before the invention of the computer. Grace Hopper who pioneered the concept of automatic programming and was one of the earliest computer programmers during. World War II. Jake Feinler.

Without access to cannabis, he\u2019ll most likely spend that time in extreme pain. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n","company":["NowThis"],"body_processed":"<p><span><span>John Inman man was arrested for weed possession, despite having a medical cannabis card. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>The Florida resident stated, \u201cSWAT shows up. You know, they all pull into my driveway. As soon as we pull on my road, I see snipers with camouflage suits coming out of the woods across the street. With rifles, assault rifles coming up on my yard. I ask the officer, \u2018Is this really necessary?\u2019 And he said, \u201cYes it is.\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>Inman claims he was wrongfully arrested March 1, for possession and intent to sell, but in the police report, he admits to selling to friends. Police found nearly 30 grams of weed in Inman\u2019s home \u2014 which is 10 grams more than the state of Florida allows one patient to possess. They also found small baggies, scales, and paraphernalia. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t work I sold glass bongs and glass pipes. It\u2019s how I made a living. I did as much research as I could to find out if I was legal or not and I couldn\u2019t find anything saying I wasn\u2019t.\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span>Six years ago, Inman was diagnosed with a rare brain condition that causes major migraines. He smokes weed to help ease the constant pain but he decided to grow his own because he claims what dispensaries were offering made him sick. In light of the arrest, Inman was hit with felony charges and is facing up to 15 years in prison. Without access to cannabis, he\u2019ll most likely spend that time in extreme pain.
