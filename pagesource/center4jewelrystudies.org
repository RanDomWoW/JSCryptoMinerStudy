The Center has offered and continues to provide quality programs that are designed to supplement the careers of those in jewelry-related fields &#8211; including dealers, appraisers, jewelers and gemologists &#8211; as well as enhance the enjoyment of collectors, heirs, and jewelry lovers.</p>
<p><strong>Programs and Projects</strong></p>
<p>The Center for Jewelry Studies is reorganizing after the passing of its Director, Christie Romero. The Projects she was working on are continuing forward. The FIDM/Fashion Institute of Design &amp; Merchandising in Los Angeles, are teaching her classes on The History of Jewelry for their new Jewelry Design Department and the collaborating with FIDM Museum and Galleries on an upcoming exhibition and catalog, called &#8220;Adorned: Two Centuries of Jewelry &amp; Dress, c. 1800-2000&#8221; scheduled to open in Fall 2011, continues.</p>
<p>FIDM is in the process of establishing a department to carry on in the spirit of Christie Romero&#8217;s passion to educate. The Center of Jewelry Studies will be a special wing at FIDM. Along with the classes she established, FIDM is acquiring her personal jewelry collection and research library to make Christie&#8217;s passion available to all.</p>

<p><strong>Announcing the Barry Weber/Christie Romero Jewelry Camp Scholarship Fund</strong></p>
<p><strong>Courtesy of Ed and Sandy Lewand&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>All of us in the jewelry community were greatly saddened by the loss of Christie Romero in late 2009. Rather than making a donation to the American Cancer Society, Barry Weber of Edith Weber Jewelry had the idea to establish a Christie Romero Scholarship Fund for Jewelry Camp.</p>
<p>Who could have imagined that one year later the jewelry industry would lose another beloved faculty member. As most of you know we lost Barry Weber late 2010 to this horrible disease. Edward and I would like to continue the scholarship that Barry established a short time ago but feel it is only fitting to rename the scholarship to the Romero-Weber Jewelry Camp Scholarship Fund.</p>
<p>Applicants for the 2011 scholarship should composes a brief essay or email explaining why they should be selected to attend. Please send applications to jewelrycamp@me.com The cut-off date for scholarship application is April 30, 2011. The recipient of the award will be announced in May, giving ample time to make arrangements.</p>
<p>This scholarship will cover the cost of Jewelry Camp Tuition only at this time. All other costs, lodging, travel and food are the responsibility of the recipient.</p>

<p><strong>ALL THAT GLITTERS EXHIBIT, SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA</strong></p>
<p>From May 2010 to May 2012, in San Diego, the All That Glitters exhibit is not to be missed. Curator Elise Misiorowski has been acclaimed for her arrangement and design of this exhibit. The SDMNH describes the exhibit as a &#8220;5000-square-foot exhibition, All That Glitters: The Splendor and Science of Gems and Minerals, with displays of gems, minerals, carvings and jewelry from around the world, is developed and created by the San Diego Natural History Museum’s award-winning exhibitions team under the leadership of curator Elise Misiorowski, GG.</p>
<p>It is on display through April 2012 and will not travel to any other venue. During this time period there will be occasional changes in several of the displays, so you will want to return and see the new additions!&#8221; For more information, visit the SDNHM website.</p>
<p><strong>GEMS &amp; JEWELRY VIDEO NOW ACCESSIBLE ONLINE</strong></p>
<p>The Center for Jewelry Studies is pleased to announce the online availability of &#8220;Gems &amp; Jewelry,&#8221; an educational video produced by The Futures Channel. Christie Romero is one of three experts who were interviewed for this video, which is distributed to schools and teachers to incorporate into their lesson plans. It shows the students how math and science can be applied to &#8220;real life&#8221; occupations. We think this excellent production will inspire them to become gemologists, gem-cutters, and jewelry historians!</p>
<p>To see the video, click www.thefutureschannel.com</p>
<p>The Center for Jewelry Studies is pleased to announce the launch of a new online publication:</p>
<p>&#8220;Organic Gems&#8221; is an online periodical devoted entirely to gem materials of plant and animal origin, the best known being amber, jet, ivory, bone, horn, tortoiseshell, pearl, shell and coral. It will be published six times annually, and is accessible by subscription, through the web site of Maggie Campbell Pedersen, author of Gem and Ornamental Materials of Organic Origin.</p>
<p>OG will be illustrated with good quality, descriptive photographs. Every issue will contain an article giving basic backgrounds and information on one of the organic materials (e.g. how to recognize it, how to test it, and whether it is covered by trade bans). Further articles will cover any and every aspect of organics, from their historical uses, to their modern-day enhancing treatments.</p>
<p>A guest author will contribute to each issue, sharing his or her expertise in the field of organics. Guest authors will include museum curators, conservators, gemologists, auctioneers, appraisers and jewelers.</p>
<p>Last, but possibly most importantly, the final section in each issue, &#8220;Forum – the readers’ page,&#8221; will bring the most up-to-date information available on research, market trends, frauds, fakes, and anything else that may be of use to the subscribers, who are invited to contribute with information and comments. Check out Beyond4Cs.com for a <a href="https://beyond4cs.com">comprehensive diamond guide</a>.</p>

In addition to jewelry historians, its membership is composed of collectors, dealers, jewelry artists, appraisers, curators, and retail jewelers. Anyone with an interest in the study of jewelry is welcome to join.</p>
<p>The Society sponsors four lectures and a special event per year in New York City featuring specialists in all areas of jewelry—from ancient to antique, from period to contemporary. The New England Chapter holds several lectures every year in Boston, MA. A quarterly newsletter, including an extensive calendar of jewelry-related events, a website and a membership directory are also included in a members’ benefits. The Society also sponsors an all day seminar biannually. www.jewelryhistorians.org</p>
