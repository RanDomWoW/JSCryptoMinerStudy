      <p>SimulationCraft is a tool to explore combat mechanics in the popular MMO RPG World of Warcraft. It is a multi-player event-driven simulator written in C++ that models raid damage.</p>

<p>Increasing class synergy and the prevalence of proc-based combat modifiers have eroded the accuracy of traditional calculators that rely upon closed-form approximations to model very complex mechanics. The goal of this simulator is to close the accuracy gap while maintaining a performance level high enough to calculate relative stat weights to aid gear selection.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of this site is to host sample analysis generated by SimulationCraft. This provides players with easy access to simulation results at various gear points and patch levels.</p>

<p>It is important that information flow in both directions. After examining the reports, players may detect <strong>inconsistencies</strong> with their experiences in-game. In addition, <b>inefficiencies</b> (talents, glyphs, gear, gems, enchants) may be found in the supplied profiles. <b>Please</b> take the time to open an <a href="https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/issues"><strong>issue</strong></a>. We are continuously looking for new profiles, both at the normal and heroic levels.</p>

<p>If you need help on running SimulationCraft, developing custom actions lists, or have other questions, please see our <a href="https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/wiki/StartersGuide">extensive documentation</a> or check out our <a href="https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc">Github project page</a>.</p>

<p>Wondering what may have changed since the last time reports were updated? <a href="https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/commits/legion-dev">Check here!</a> We also update release notes on every official build, which are easier to understand but are not as up to date. <a href="http://www.simulationcraft.org/download.html">Check them out here</a></p>
