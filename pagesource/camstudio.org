<p class="subhead">What is it?</p>
<p> CamStudio is able to record all screen and audio activity on
              your computer and create industry-standard AVI video files and
              using its built-in SWF Producer can turn those AVIs into lean,
              mean, bandwidth-friendly Streaming Flash videos (SWFs) </p>
<p>Here are just a few ways you can use this software:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use it to create demonstration videos for any software
                program</li>
<li><strong>Or how about creating a set of videos answering your
                  most frequently asked questions?</strong></li>
<li>You can create video tutorials for school or college class</li>
<li><strong>You can use it to record a recurring problem with your
                  computer so you can show technical support people</strong></li>
<li>You can use it to create video-based information products you
                can <span class="style2">sell</span></li>
<li>You can even use it to record new tricks and techniques you
                discover on your favourite software program, before you forget
                them</li></ul>

<p>&ldquo;Nick, here is what I think I'll do; rather than fork out
                      the $300.00 bucks for<span class="style1"> <strong>[CENSORED]</strong></span>,
                      I'll just keep using CamStudio. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a self-employed consultant that works in the public
                      safety community (cops, fire, ems, dispatch etc). What I
                      have planned is to use CamStudio to capture on screen
                      video for training vids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for a great product and your help!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subhead">Don't like the sound of your voice? No problem.</p>
<p>CamStudio can also add high-quality, anti-aliased (no jagged
              edges) screen captions to your recordings in seconds and with the
              unique Video Annotation feature you can even personalise your
              videos by including a webcam movie of yourself
              &quot;picture-in-picture&quot; over your desktop.</p>
<p>And if all that wasn't enough, CamStudio also comes with its own
              Lossless Codec that produces crystal clear results with a much
              smaller filesize compared with other more popular codecs, like
              Microsoft Video 1.</p>
<p>You have total control over the output of your video: you can
              choose to use custom cursors, to record the whole screen or just a
              section of it and can reduce or increase the quality of the
              recording depending on if you want smaller videos (for emailing to
              people, for instance) or you can have &quot;best quality&quot; ones for
              burning onto CD/DVD.</p>
<p>But all of these features would be worthless if CamStudio wasn't
              easy to use ... fortunately that's not the case. CamStudio can be
              learned in a matter of minutes and comes with a comprehensive
              built-in helpfile, so if you <strong>do</strong> manage to get
              stuck, you can simply hit &quot;Help&quot; and get the answers you need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subhead">So where can I get it and how much does it cost?</p>
<p>You can download and use it completely free - yep - completely
              100% free for your personal and commercial projects as CamStudio
              and the Codec are released under the GPL (for more details on this
              license, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">click here</a>.) </p>
<p>There are no royalties or any monies to pay - although if you do
              use it for a commercial product, I wouldn't say no to a copy of
              whatever you produce <img alt="" src="images/smilie.gif" width="15" height="15" /></p>

<p class="style4" align="left"><span class="subhead">CamStudio's
                History </span></p>
<p>CamStudio was originally released by a company called RenderSoft
              who were subsequently bought by a company called eHelp who used
              some of the technology in their program, RoboDemo ...</p>
<p>Some time later, eHelp was bought by Macromedia who wanted
              RoboDemo (which was to become Captivate) ...</p>
<p>Knowing that CamStudio did some of the stuff RoboDemo did for
              free (mainly export to streaming Flash), they released a newer
              version which fixed some bugs but most importantly, removed
              certain features. Gone was the ability to create SWFs, added was
              the requirement to register to use it, and over time, links to the
              various webpages that had CamStudio and its source code, became
              broken.</p>
<p>However, I managed to find an earlier version complete with the
              related CamStudio video codec and the source code for both then put the website up so
              people could download them.</p>

<p class="subhead">Issues</p>
<p>A number of people have mentioned having trouble viewing SWF
              videos generated by CamStudio. It turns out there's a bug which
              means you can't see anything if you try watching them with
              Netscape or Firefox (Internet Explorer works fine) ...</p>
<p>The next update (2.5) will fix this but until then, here's a
              temporary workaround:</p>
              <table align="center" bgcolor="#DFF4FF" border="1" bordercolor="#0000CC" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="500">

<p class="style8">Open the related HTML to the SWF you've
                      just generated and look for the line starting with the &quot;<strong>EMBED

<p class="style8">Save the file and you should be good to go
                      ... </p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>I seem to be getting a lot of questions about a registration code
              ... the version of CamStudio available from this site doesn't
              require registration AND has more features, so uninstall v2.1 from
              your system, download and install CamStudio from here and you're
              good to go! </p>
<p>If your computer's memory or virtual memory usage starts climbing
              rapidly when viewing a SWF authored by CamStudio to the point when
              your PC locks up so you have to reboot it, recreate the SWF from
              your source AVI file and in SWF Producer, make sure you select the
              Advanced tab and check the Memory Management tickbox (Manage Flash
              player internal memory). That should sort the problem out. <strong>Thanks
                to Ben Ward for the fix.</strong> </p>

<p><span class="subhead">A Plea For Help ...</span> </p>
<p>I've got big plans for CamStudio and want to continously improve
              it and the Codec as well ... but I'm not a programmer.</p>
<p>The potential for CamStudio to be used as a professional training
              and support tool is huge and not just in the information
              technology and internet marketing arenas, but also in diverse
              markets and tasks like home eduation, recording online
              geneological research, keeping a video record of special offer
              prices on your favourite snowboarding (or whatever) website - you
              get the idea ... <img alt="" src="images/smilie.gif" width="15" height="15" /></p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you're at home in Las Vegas or on an Alaskan
              Cruise - if you've got a laptop or PC you can use CamStudio. </p>
<p>So if there are any Visual C++ programmers out there that have
              Flash, video encoding and codec experience who'd like a challenge,
              please get in touch. </p>
<p>So, at some point in the near future I'd like to start accepting
              donations so any coders that work on this project will get some
              kind of financial reward in addition to the warm, fuzzy feeling
              they get from helping to resurrect this cracking piece of software
              ... so if you're feeling generous, please get in touch at the
              email address above and let me know. </p>
<p>I'd also love to get your feedback on CamStudio ... what you
              liked, what you thought sucked and what you think is missing.</p>
