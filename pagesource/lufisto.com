      <p><strong>03/19/18 &ndash; Shine Championship Defense and Tag Team Gold Opportunity at Shimmer 100 at &quot;More Than Mania&quot;!</strong></p>
      <p>The SHINE Championship reign of LuFisto continued at  SHINE 49 further cementing her legacy as the longest reigning SHINE Champion of  all time; however, she may be in for a rude awakening at the WWN Supershow:  Mercury Rising 2018 on April 6th, 2018 at 8 PM CDT in New Orleans, LA. It looks  like we will all find out how the champion handles things on the dark side&hellip;</p>
      <p><iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WSWo7TeNBRs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
      <p>So there it is! LuFisto defends her Shine Championship against Holidead at WWNLive Mercury Rising!</p>
      <p><strong>SHIMMER 100... Looking for Tag Team Gold! </strong></p>
      <p> Signed for SHIMMER 100 on April 7th in New  Orleans: SHIMMER Tag Team Champions Leva Bates &amp; Delilah Doom will take on  challengers LuFisto &amp; Hudson Envy! 4pm bell time!</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/shows/shimmer100tag.jpg" width="700" height="394" /></p>
      <p>LuFisto and Envy might be a new tag team but the  chemistry and viciousness they showed at the last SHIMMER events in Berwyn IL  last November definitely makes them a dangerous combo. Will LuFisto and Hudson  destroy T4 and become the Shimmer Tag Team Champions at SHIMMER 100?</p>

      <p><em>Saturday, March 3rd 2018 in Stevens, PA &ndash; </em>LuFisto was first scheduled to face Vanity in singles competition but as soon as the Wounded Owl came out of the locker room, Adira attacked her. In the ring, both Vanity and Adira were kicking LuFisto until Allie Recks came to the rescue. The match then turned into a tag team fight. As Vanity and LuFisto were argueing outside with a chair and that referee Aubrey Rose was busy with them, Adira used her chain to knock out Allie Recks. Vanity and LuFisto kept on fighting at ringside when Adira got the 1-2-3 over Recks to secure the victory for her team.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>02/23/18 - An update&hellip; Cancer and depression, GoFund requests, shows and all that jazz...</strong></p>
      <p><em>I went to my family doctor this morning. She has been following for the past year because of the depression so I see her on a regular basis to talk and also update my medication if necessary. We&rsquo;ve been trying something new in the past month and things in my head have been a little bit better.</em></p>
      <p><em> Better because I have been training 5 days a week again for the past 3 weeks. Before, I could barely get out of bed. Also, two people in my life have been instrumental in helping me believe I could get back on track in my friend Karine who never gives up no matter what and Bonnie Maxson who has given me tools to &ldquo;get my shit together&rdquo; when it comes to training and finding motivation again.</em></p>
      <p><em> This morning however, when my family doctor said she had seen my biopsy results and mentioned the word &ldquo;cancer&rdquo;, it hit me harder than the last time. I&rsquo;ve been more preoccupied about the financial aspect of the illness than the problem itself so maybe that is why I wasn&rsquo;t too concerned about the illness. Maybe I was feeling invincible too and didn&rsquo;t take it seriously. I don&rsquo;t know.</em></p>
      <p><em> Being a US resident, an immigrant and not a citizen, I cannot have any type of government help. Also, I can&rsquo;t have credit of any type until 5 to 7 years&hellip; Unless I buy a new car. Why can I get credit for a car? I honestly don&rsquo;t know&hellip; But I don&rsquo;t need a car. So I&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;shopping&rdquo; for my health and so far, there is no progress. I&rsquo;m waiting on an update of a hospital in Baltimore to see if they can do something at a better price.</em></p>
      <p><em> Also, I mentioned that I might need a hysterectomy (full removal of uterus and everything that goes with it). Well, I learned from my insurance that, if there was uterine cancer, all procedures wouldn&rsquo;t be covered after the one I need to remove the cells on my cervix&hellip; Because &ldquo;same illness, cancer, so pre-existing condition&rdquo;&hellip; So they won&rsquo;t pay a dime.</em></p>
      <p><em> Also, before you go and say &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Canadian, go to Canada and get it for free&rdquo;&hellip; Well, it doesn&rsquo;t work that way. Once you move away from the country, unless you spend 181 days (6 months) per year in Canada, you lose all your benefits, all your health care stuff, everything&hellip; That is the law. If I would get the surgery there, it will be less expensive indeed, but we are still talking about a few thousands&hellip; But, I have good credit there so, I could get a loan to &ldquo;get fixed&rdquo;.</em></p>
      <p><em> Many of you have reached out for me to start a GoFund because you want to help. I am so grateful and blessed by you wanting to help me get over this. </em></p>
      <p><em> However, my main concern though is that there have been horror stories with GoFund, people judging the ones using it, even if it is for good reasons, and also all the people who used it for what we could qualify as &ldquo;stupid stuff&rdquo;. </em></p>
      <p><em> Many cancer survivors reached out to share their stories and mentioned that I should accept all the help I can get, to embrace it and not feel ashamed of it. I can&rsquo;t help it though&hellip; Having people give me their hard earned money for something they are not responsible for is hard to swallow for me. Misplaced pride? Maybe. I still feel guilty that some people helped me when I had my nose broken and ear drum busted last December.</em></p>
      <p><em> Also, to be totally honest, with my head not being at a right place right now, I really don&rsquo;t feel like being judged or laughed at (oh yeah, I&rsquo;ve seen sick and hurt people being laughed at because they used GoFund). So that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m at when it comes to GoFund and crowd funding.</em></p>
      <p><em> Some people have taken the step to surprise me by sending me money via my PayPal and I&rsquo;m extremely grateful. If for some reason you would decide to do so, please leave me an address so I can at least send you a little something.</em></p>
      <p><em> So here is the little update for now. I don&rsquo;t sleep well and it&rsquo;s been a dark place in my mind lately. I&rsquo;m facing the possibility that I might have to leave the home and family here that I built in the past 2 years or the possibility of having debts for the rest of my life because of the illness that needs to be removed from my body. I&rsquo;m also dealing with the upcoming death of a friend who only has a few days to live. <br />
  It&rsquo;s just a lot to deal with at the same time. I&rsquo;ve been crying a lot as I listen to a lot of Chris Cornell. I train to stay sane and to get my anger out because I&rsquo;m extremely angry at life in general. My doctor told me that it was a natural process of people getting an illness diagnostic and facing the death of a loved one&hellip; I try to get little happiness in the small things like seeing my fluffy furry babies walking around and giving me cuddles.</em></p>
      <p><em> Please once again let me thank you all for the outburst of love and support I&rsquo;ve been getting in the past two weeks. I think I answered all the e-mails I had but if I didn&rsquo;t, please bear with me. I will answer.</em></p>
      <p><em> Thank you to all the fans that showed up at Nova Pro and Glory Pro this past week. Performing for you all is helping more than you will ever know as it gives me a sense of normality (in this abnormal wrestling world.) Some of you insisted on paying my t-shirts more so I could save money&hellip; And some of you even gave me money without telling me, sneaking away from the table. I&rsquo;m blessed and grateful by those kind gestures.</em></p>
      <p><em> I&rsquo;ll let you know when I have more updates and please feel free to share your stories with me. They are inspiring and comforting at the same time.</em></p>
      <p><em> To my brothers and sisters dealing with depression, you have my heart for trying to live, control and let go of the pain that is misunderstood.</em></p>
      <p><em> To the ones who fought, lost or survived themselves against cancer, you have my respect for the fight you dealt with and for the loved ones you lost and who are now watching over.</em></p>
      <p><em> I love you all. </em></p>
      <p><em> See you Saturday at JAPW in Rahway, NJ and Sunday at Beyond Wrestling in Worcester, MA.</em></p>

      <p><strong>02/20/18 - Nova Pro Wrestling's Cupid's Chokehold and Glory Pro's One Year Anniversary Results.</strong></p>
      <p><em>Friday,  February 16th 2018, Annandale, VA </em>&ndash; LuFisto defeated Faye Jackson by  arm bar submission at ova Pro Wrestling. Both ladies had been battling outside  the ring in this grudge match where LuFisto used a post to target Jackson&rsquo;s  arm.</p>
      <p><em>Sunday,  February 18th 2018, Edwardsville, IL </em>&ndash; LuFisto  defeated Savannah Stone via Burning Hammer at Glory Pro.<strong> </strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>02/15/18 - The word you don&rsquo;t want to hear&hellip; </strong></p>
      <p><em><img src="images/news/lufi.jpg" width="300" height="312" hspace="10" align="left" />I&rsquo;ve been debating if this is something I should  share. I don&rsquo;t even know if this is the right thing to do.</em></p>
      <p><em>Not many know but I&rsquo;ve been struggling with heavy  depression for over a year now. I&rsquo;m on medication and the anxiety, sadness and  pain has been so heavy that I also developed IBS. I also gained a lot of  weight. For those who are talking &ldquo;Hey, did you see? LuFisto is fat again&rdquo;&hellip;  Well, that is the reason. I might get into this subject on how I got there in  the future but not right now&hellip;</em></p>
      <p><em>I&rsquo;m not writing this piece for this reason. </em></p>
      <p><em>After my post about my 38th birthday today,  many friends and fans reached out because they are wondering what is wrong. A  lot of my fans have shown support and I&rsquo;ve always said that I would&rsquo;ve quit a  long time ago if it wasn&rsquo;t from them and that remains true, more than ever.  Therefore, although I am a very private person, I feel that I need to be  totally honest with you all, the people who have supported me for all these  years, family and friends.</em></p>
      <p><em>The main reason why I&rsquo;ve been feeling like crap is  probably because I need to talk about it and I don&rsquo;t feel right hiding  something. So here it is&hellip; </em></p>
      <p><em>I have cervical cancer.</em></p>
      <p><em>They found the cells last week and I need to get a  surgery to remove them&hellip; Not the burning thing, a surgery. Although it is not a  big procedure for now, I still have to go under the knife and honestly, I&rsquo;m not  too thrilled about it. I know I&rsquo;ve been distant to family and friends and I  feel I haven&rsquo;t been as productive anywhere because I&rsquo;m too much in my head.</em></p>
      <p><em>The cells being very close to the uterus so they also  need to take samples to check if the disease did not get in there. Today, I was  also told that my insurance was not covering the whole procedure and it is way too  overpriced for something that is supposed to be simple. It is probably the  Canadian in me that can&rsquo;t understand why people&rsquo;s health is treated the same  way as if you would buy a used car in the United States&hellip; I&rsquo;m extremely upset and  at this point, I don&rsquo;t even know what will happen.</em></p>
      <p><em>I&rsquo;m trying to get answers from the hospital about the  costs and options but I keep getting no answers. &ldquo;We will call you back!&rdquo; They  never do. When they did, they didn&rsquo;t even have the right information. </em></p>
      <p><em>Also, if they find bad cells in the uterus, I will  need a full hysterectomy to prevent the disease to spread anywhere else. Not  that I want to get into the &ldquo;vagina&rdquo; too much but, hysterectomy means that they  will remove everything on the inside if you don&rsquo;t know the medical term.</em></p>
      <p><em>The heart defect/ stoke, the injuries, the betrayals,  the hard work that doesn&rsquo;t pay off, the depressions, the IBS and now this&hellip; Some  people, close and far, have been through way worse and I don&rsquo;t want to complain  while there are people losing loved one and people getting shot at schools,  which is despicable and really kills all the faith I have in the human race. I&rsquo;m  just so tired. And frustrated too.</em></p>
      <p><em>Anyway, these are the facts and where I&rsquo;m at now. Apparently,  recovery is no longer than 2 weeks so I shouldn&rsquo;t miss any shows as I&rsquo;m trying  to work things out so the surgery happens on a week I already took off, that is  if I can get the surgery if there is a way to lower the costs. Hopefully, I will get  some answers soon. </em></p>
      <p><em>If for some reasons this situation would affect my  performances, my availability to you all or my mood and patience, please  forgive me. </em></p>
      <p><em>God bless and see you at Nova Pro and Glory Pro this weekend. </em></p>
