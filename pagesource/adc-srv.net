<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Four Ways to Say No (Opt out)</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> * Download opt-out cookies. This 
  is a process that usually involves clicking on a button to download the opt-out 
  cookie. To do this, you go to the marketer's Web site, find the privacy policy, 
  then find the &quot;opt out&quot; information. The cookie your computer will 
  get tells the company not to track you anymore. Yes, it is a little bit of extra 
  work to click on the links. See the &quot;More About Opt Out Cookies&quot; section 
  below for more information.<br>
  <br>
  * Use the cookie management tools in your Web browser. Also, use cookie management 
  tools to be selective in what long-term cookies you accept. In the newest versions 
  of most web browsers, you can set your browser to accept only session cookies, 
  or to turn all cookies into session cookies. Session cookies are generally harmless. 
  For Macintosh Safari users, you can tell the browser to only accept cookies 
  from &quot;the site you are navigating to.&quot; This means that you will not 
  accept third party cookies. To explore what cookie settings are available to 
  you, look in the &quot;preferences&quot; or &quot;options&quot; section of your 
  browser's menu.<br>
  <br>
  * View current cookies and delete what you don't need. Most Web browsers allow 
  you to see what cookies you already have stored. You may have thousands of cookies 
  if you are like many Web surfers. Some cookies, such as registration cookies 
  for Web sites you visit frequently, are useful to keep around. But other cookies, 
  like tracking cookies from atdmt.com, doubleclick.net, 2o7.net, atwola.com, 
  and other advertisers aren't necessarily helpful to you. Delete the cookies 
  you don't need, and do a periodic check every couple of months to weed out your 
  cookie folder.<br>
  <br>
  * Check your account preferences on registration sites. Some sites, such as 
  eBay, require registration and the use of cookies. On eBay, for example, if 
  you do not opt-out of advertising tracking, information about your eBay activities 
  can be used by other sites and advertisers outside of eBay. EBay discloses this 
  in its privacy policy. However, using your account preferences, you can opt-out 
  of this kind of tracking. In this case, you are not downloading an opt-out cookie, 
  you are setting a preference on a site where you have registration information.<br>
  <br>
  * For more information: the World Privacy Forum published a report about various 
  kinds of online tracking cookies as part of its testimony about behavioral advertising 
  to the Federal Trade Commission. That report discusses opt out cookies (see 
  below), and it also discusses rarer kinds of cookies such as Flash Cookies, 
  Silverlight Cookies, and others. The report is located here: http://www.worldprivacyforum.org/pdf/WPF_NAI_report_Nov2_2007fs.pdf.</font></p>
