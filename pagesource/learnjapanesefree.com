Japanese is the official language of Japan. It is called "Nihongo" in Japanese.  Japanese script has been adopted from the Chinese language. The Chinese script was modified and three different scripts of Japanese were created. The language is written by combining three scripts whose names are Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji. In olden time, Japanese was written vertically. In addition, it was written from right to left and would start from the very last page to the first page. In other words, from back to front. However, in modern times this system has been changed and is written in the normal way.
<p>
Hiragana is the basic script. It is used to write words, which cannot be written in kanji. In addition, kanji cannot be converted into the different tenses.  Katakana is used for foreign names and words. Kanji is the pictorial script, which was primarily taken from China. From kanji were made hiragana and katakana.
<p>
There are two basic forms of Japanese language. One is the Hyoujungo, which means 'standard Japanese', and the other is called the kyoutsugo, which means 'common language'. The Hyoujungo form is widely used on television, while teaching in schools and during official communication. There is a difference between the formal way of speaking language and the colloquial way of speaking the language. 
<p>
Like the other languages of the world, even Japanese has dialects. The three main dialects are the Tokyo dialect, the Osaka dialect and the Kyushyu dialect. The main difference between the dialects is of the pitch, morphology, vocabulary and accent. Very few people use Kyushyu dialect. Tokyo dialect is used widely in Japan as well as around the world.
<p>
Japanese people greatly believe in giving respect to people. According to the social level, age, job and experience of the person different level of Japanese is spoken accordingly. Children are allowed to use plain form in their conversation but once they are adults, it is necessary for them to talk in polite form. Polite form of language also indicates new associates or connections with new and unknown people. Teineigo means polite language. Kenjougo means humble language. Sonkeigo means respectful language. It is tradition in Japan that they never call each other by their given name. It is always by the family name that they refer each other to. In addition, to give more respect they always add "san" after the family name, which means either Mr. or Mrs. or Miss.
<p>
Japanese grammar is simple to understand. It is very different from that of English grammar. In Japanese grammar, the sentence should end with a verb. The simple sentence structure is [Subject] [Object] [Verb]. One of the most important elements of the grammar is the Particles. "Counters" were made for counting different objects. 
<p>
My view about learning Japanese: I have learned the language and I personally love the language because it has very interesting scripts and the grammar too. I personally believe that if you like the language then it is very easy to learn it. All the Best to all of those who are planning to study Japanese language.</td></tr></table>
