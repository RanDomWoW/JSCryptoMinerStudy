                     <a class="header" href="http://www.supermegamonkey.net/2018/03/job_guarantee_vs_ubi.shtml">Job Guarantee vs. UBI</a>
                        <font class="text">
                              <p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoU2YL3hWvk" target="_blank">Sanders Institute video</a> about a National Jobs Guarantee is worth watching, but i have some serious grumbles.  I support a Job Guarantee but i hate the way it's being pitched as an alternative to Universal Basic Income.  JG ensures that everyone who wants to get ahead by working can do so.  UBI helps correct the major problem we have with financial (income and wealth) inequality.  The two programs could be complementary.  UBI creates a new floor; JG ensures that people who are willing and able to work can rise beyond that floor.  But if the two must compete, UBI is a far superior solution.</p>

<p>What's extra frustrating is that the people who argue for JG - like Stephanie Kelton, who i otherwise admire - suddenly start using all the arguments against UBI that you'd expect to hear from a center-left liberal (or worse).</p>

<p>The first thing to understand about JG is that it is an almost ACA-level Rube Goldberg contraption of moving parts.  It requires jobs to be invented.  Jobs that match all possible skill sets.  Jobs for physical laborers, jobs for displaced IT professionals, jobs for people with disabilities, etc., etc.. Additionally, the jobs have to be the sort that aren't important enough to be permanent, because the whole idea is that most people go into these jobs during recessions and come out of them when the economy gets good again.  That suggests <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration" target="_blank">WPA</a> style jobs like park beautification, the creation of art, the recording of oral histories (which was a WPA job; the modern equivalent might be updating Wikipedia pages or something), etc..  Things that i'm not at all against, but which you might describe as make-work.  However, Kelton's proposal includes things like child & elderly care and moving to a green economy.  Those are not temporary jobs!  You don't want to funnel a bunch of semi-qualified people into those positions and then have them leave when the economy gets good again.  So there's a massive amount of administration that needs to happen to coordinate and balance all of that. It also requires a massive bureaucracy to evaluate people and place them into the appropriate jobs.  Per Kelton's proposal, this bureaucracy will be administered at the local level, which comes with all sorts of problems that i'll discuss below.</p>

<p>Additionally, the JG in Kelton's proposal acts as a stealth raise to the minimum wage and a stealth universal healthcare, because the idea is that these jobs will pay a minimum of $15 an hour (which Kelton calls a "living wage" but it <a href="http://www.supermegamonkey.net/2018/02/15_isnt_even_enough.shtml">is not</a>) and will provide people with health insurance.  So if you have some other job not providing those things, you can quit and get a job from the JG, and that puts pressure on employers.  Which is a good thing in the abstract, but it also suggests that the JG is being put forth as competition not just to UBI but to Medicare For All and the Fight For Fifteen (and/or a true living wage).</p>

<p>So with all of that in mind, let's talk about the objections to UBI.  The first thing you'll hear is the very conservative idea about the "dignity of work" and how people will just sit at home and grow mold if they're just handed (a very modest amount of) money.  This nonsense was already intrinsically rebutted during the debate about the ACA.  How many times did we hear about how once people weren't tied to a shitty job because of their insurance needs that they would become entrepreneurs, start their own business, take on some risky career that they've always wanted to, stay home to give some much needed care to their kids/parents, spend more time doing charity work, etc.?  The same argument can be made here.  Freed from the burden of having to scrounge for a basic living, people will do what they want to do and will be inherently more productive and give much more back to society.  Anyone who's been on the internet knows that people do this naturally: they code free software, they do research and update Wikipedia, they make free music, they make free web comics, they make free Youtube videos, they spend massive amounts of time working on comic book fan sites.  The idea that we're all going to sit home and drool is counter to everything we know about people.</p>

<p>All of the other arguments about UBI can also be made about JG.  Kelton says that the UBI amount would be subject to Congress where budget "hawks" would always be trying to lower it.  But the same is true of the minimum wage for JG, and the generosity of the health insurance, AND the amount of funding for the bureaucracy and available jobs.</p>

<p>Another argument is that some people arguing for UBI (mostly the Zuckerberg types) are proposing it as a <em>replacement</em> for existing social programs, which would of course be awful.  But no progressive is arguing for this kind of UBI (and i feel like Kelton was downright disingenuous in the video for not acknowledging that).  And people make the same argument about JG - it could easily replace TANF, for example.  And even the stealth ways that it addresses minimum wage and universal health care raise problems along these lines.</p>

<p>Kelton also says that a problem with UBI is that rich people will get the check as well as poor people.  This is literally Hillary Clinton's "Why should we pay for Donald Trump's kids to go to public college?" argument.  The answer, obvious to anyone, is that you get the money back by raising the top marginal tax rate. Kelton knows this and it's very disappointing to see her using that line.</p>

<p>The concerns about inflation are the same for both as well, and so is the response (there's so much slack in the economy that we're <em>not even meeting the Fed's current inflation target</em> let alone in danger of real inflation, and in any event the Fed can control inflation with interest rates).</p>

<p>Kelton says that the money people would be getting from JG would result in a massive economic stimulus, which i agree with but the <a href="http://www.supermegamonkey.net/2017/09/dont_tell_them_yet.shtml">same would be true of UBI</a>.  And the question of how to "pay" for it - which would be weird coming from the country's premiere <a href="http://www.supermegamonkey.net/2017/09/the_la_times_they_are_a_changi.shtml">MMT</a> economist - applies equally to JG and UBI.</p>

<p>Then we get to the bureaucracy.  Progressives/leftists love universal programs (<a href="http://www.supermegamonkey.net/2017/07/make_government_simple.shtml">1</a>,<a href="http://www.supermegamonkey.net/2017/07/universal_programs.shtml">2</a>) because they require very little administration and are inherently fair.  But JG puts a lot of arbitrary power into the hands of local administrators.  And the first thing that makes me think of is how the New Deal failed black people by allowing the programs to be administered at the local level, thus allowing racist bureaucrats to exclude them (c.f. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/When-Affirmative-Action-White-Twentieth-Century/dp/0393328511/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1521670540" target="_blank">When Affirmative Action Was White</a>).  In a time when every Republican-controlled state with a large black population opted out of the ACA, this remains a legitimate concern.  Beyond that, you <em>know</em> that conservatives (including rightwing Dems) are going to demand that the job seekers pass drug tests and that there's a very easy way to fire people, making the "guarantee" not so much of a guarantee.  And the grifting opportunity is huge - how do you prevent the local bureaucrats from creating jobs that benefit campaign donors?  With a higher level of bureaucracy, maybe?  Turtles all the way up?  With UBI, everybody just gets a check.</p>

<p>Another kind of grift comes from the fact that in order to determine what types of jobs should be in the JG, the bureaucracies are going to need to hire "experts" from think tanks.  In fact, i'd argue that center-left think tanks like CAP are pushing for JG precisely because of these grifting opportunities.  Again, with UBI, everybody just gets a check.  </p>

<p>It's good that we're talking about stuff like this.  It's good whenever the left is pushing new ideas and isn't just trying to figure out how to undo the damage Trump is doing.  But if these programs are in competition with each other, the Jobs Guarantee should get a much lower priority.</p>

And i'm actually surprised he didn't include "Pack the Supreme Court" in there; i <em>think</em> i've seen him advocate for that before.  It would of course be controversial (FDR tried and failed) but the Court already has no legitimacy and left alone it would be a major partisan blocker to any Dem agenda.</p>

<blockquote>From 2003 to 2005, Gina Haspel was a senior official overseeing a top-secret C.I.A. program that subjected dozens of suspected terrorists to savage interrogations, which included depriving them of sleep, squeezing them into coffins, and forcing water down their throats. In 2002, Haspel was among the C.I.A. officers present at the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah, an Al Qaeda suspect who was tortured so brutally that at one point he appeared to be dead.

<p>On Thursday, the Trump Administration announced that Haspel would become the C.I.A.'s new deputy director.</p>

<p>..."You are putting a person in a leadership position who was centrally involved in an illegal program," Sifton told me. President Barack Obama ordered the closure of the secret prisons, or black sites, in 2009.</p>

<p>A former government official, who spoke to me on condition of anonymity, said that the promotion of Haspel amounted to the C.I.A.'s revenge. "The agency is giving the finger to anyone who was ever critical of the program," the former official said.</p>

<p>...When Obama took office, in 2009, he declared that he would not prosecute anyone involved in the C.I.A.'s interrogation programs, not even senior officers, among whom Haspel was one. At the time, Obama said he wanted to look forward and not back. But the past, as Obama well knows, never goes away. With the prospect of American torture looming again, I wonder if Obama regrets his decision. After all, people like Haspel, quite plausibly, could have gone to prison.</blockquote></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> It's come out that Gina Haspel wasn't involved in one particular instance of torture but was instead involved in a <em>different</em> instance of torture and also helped destroy evidence so we don't really know who was involved in what instances of torture.  And somehow that's supposed to make it all ok.</p>

<blockquote>
After receiving yet another one of Chunzi's checks on my desk, I wrote a terse email to human resources and copied our managing editor. "These mistakes," I wrote, "are extremely offensive and unacceptable." The managing editor called me into his office to apologize, but he rationalized the situation: "I don't think anyone here's got a mean bone in their body," he said.

<p>This is part of the problem: White people and even Asians themselves dismiss the issue. We laugh at it because it's not malicious. The Asian women I've spoken to have largely rolled their eyes when this has happened or have tried to be good-humored about it. (Several Asian women I know have switched seats with the other Asians in their offices to see if their white male bosses noticed; they didn't.) America Ferrera and Eva Longoria recently made fun of these types of errors in a routine at the Golden Globes.</p>

<p>Nicole Chung, writing in the Toast, calls these experiences "casual racism" and notes that, as minorities, we are often afraid of how white people will feel if we call them out. "What does our dignity matter, what do our feelings amount to, when we could embarrass white people we care about? When our white relatives or friends or colleagues might experience a moment's discomfort, anxiety, or guilt?" she writes.<br />
<div style="text-align: center;">...</div><br />
"You're so pretty," a woman at a concert told me. "My son is marrying a Vietnamese girl. Are you Vietnamese?"</p>

<p><em>You're so pretty, too!</em> I wanted to say. <em>My cousin is marrying a white guy from Tennessee. Are you from Tennessee?</em> But I didn't say it.</p>

<p>Sometimes I'm so stunned by what's happening that I'm at a loss for words -- like when a man on the subway announced to me, apropos of nothing, "I was just in Shanghai last week!" But this won't stop until we learn to speak up. Part of that includes being brave enough to call this phenomenon for what it is: racist. But the onus isn't just on us inching past our fear of embarrassing a white person. It's on white people to learn to make distinguishing faces a priority. Whether they realize it or not, the repeated misidentification broadcasts its own message: I'm Asian, indistinct and not worth remembering.<br />

<blockquote>...many analysts see Romney voters who flipped to Mrs. Clinton as an illustration of how the Democratic Party now survives in significant part by appealing to more upscale voters.

<p>Frustratingly, however, these perspectives play down the importance of a crucial group of disaffected voters: those who voted for Mr. Obama in 2012 but then failed to go to the polls in 2016. Because this group is disproportionately young and black, this erasure is racially tinged.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Obama-to-nonvoters share the progressive policy priorities of Democrats, and they strongly identify with the Democratic Party. Four out of every five Obama-to-nonvoters identify as Democrats, and 83 percent reported they would have voted for a Democrat down-ballot. A similar share of Obama-to-nonvoters said that they would have voted for Mrs. Clinton had they turned out to vote. In short, while reclaiming some Obama-to-Trump voters would be a big help to Democratic prospects, re-energizing 2012 Obama voters who stayed home is a more plausible path for the party going forward.</p>

<p>Whether Democrats can mobilize these voters is an open question, however. Significantly, only 43 percent of Obama-to-nonvoters reported being contacted by a candidate in 2016, compared with 66 percent of Obama-to-Clinton voters. While analysts have focused on why many conservative voters switched to the Republican Party, a better question might be why a campaign that sought to energize young voters of color failed to do so.</blockquote></p>

<p>The study did some analysis of policy preferences for these voters, but it seems to have just been a kind of baseline comparison to confirm that they are "liberals" and not conservatives.  It would have been nice to see if the more progressive policies of a Bernie Sanders type candidate might have motivated them more than Clinton's platform.  My theory is that is certainly wouldn't have hurt, and it also might have peeled off a lot of the third party voters.</p>

                        <font class="text">
                              <p>I wasn't too thrilled with the way Phil Murphy got the nomination for governor, but he's shaping up to be pretty decent.  Unfortunately, he's running into <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-jersey-governor-gets-push-back-from-fellow-democrats-on-proposed-taxes-1520773200" target="_blank">opposition from other idiot Democrats</a>.</p>

<p>Idiot number one is the much hated boss of southern Jersey, Steve Sweeney, who asks if we won't please think of the poor millionaires?</p>

<blockquote>Senate President Steve Sweeney, a Democrat, said he is concerned that a millionaires tax would be too much in addition to the new federal tax law, which capped previously unlimited annual state and local tax deductions at $10,000 for individual and married filers. Mr. Sweeney previously sponsored several bills that would have raised income taxes on New Jersey residents earning more than $1 million, all of which were blocked by former Republican Gov. Chris Christie.

<p>"We're going to jack up people's taxes and they can't write it off?" Mr. Sweeney asked. "The game changed when Washington passed this so-called tax cut."</p>

<p>Instead of a tax on millionaires, Mr. Sweeney has proposed raising the state's top corporate income tax to 12% from 9%... </blockquote></p>

<p>Murphy's response to that is kind of cool, like fuck it, we'll do that <em>too</em>.</p>

<blockquote>The governor told reporters last week that he was intrigued by Mr. Sweeney's proposal but wanted more details, including about how it would affect small businesses. Mr. Murphy said he <em>didn't see it as a substitute for a millionaires tax, but "perhaps as an additional weapon at our disposal</em>."</blockquote>

<p>The other idiot has some serious paternalism for us:</p>

<blockquote>At the same time, other Democratic lawmakers are balking at Mr. Murphy's proposal to legalize marijuana, which he has said could generate more than $300 million in tax revenue. Assemblywoman Shavonda Sumter said she was concerned about how legalizing marijuana would affect urban residents' health and job prospects.

<p>"Any job you go for, especially in health care, you're doing a drug screen," she noted.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the governor said he is still committed to legalizing marijuana. Mr. Sweeney said he strongly supports legalization but acknowledged that he doesn't yet have enough support from his Democratic caucus. </blockquote></p>

<p>How about you let the people going to job interviews worry about that?  And maybe if we legalize pot, that drug screen won't be needed (for a lot of jobs) either.</p>

<p>Anyway, once again we see why we can't have nice things.</p>

Instead of boosting "subsidies meant to encourage work", just give people money.  And also spend money on job-creating infrastructure projects.  And instead of just targeting areas of "chronic joblessness", also target areas that have historically suffered from oppression and plunder.  Basically, just create a huge bottom-up stimulus program that takes into account our history.</p>

<p>But, sincerely, i am glad that Larry Summers  (et al.) are thinking in these terms.</p>

<blockquote>
As consumers have awoken to the barbaric conditions of the egg industry, they have begun to turn toward incrementally more humane alternatives, such as cage-free eggs, as well as truly humane options, such as eggs from pasture-raised hens at places like Vital Farms.
<div style="text-align: center;">...</div>
But in response, the powerful poultry industry -- which long invoked principles of the "free market" to justify their torture-derived products being available to consumers -- have now reversed course. With consumers choosing more humane egg products, lobbyists for the poultry industry are pushing laws that would force stores to carry their products even if doing so offends their moral sensibilities and ethical judgments.

<p>In Iowa, the nation's biggest egg-producing state, lawmakers, at the behest of the poultry lobby, are making their most brazen attempt yet to fight the tides of change: simply making it a legal requirement for grocery stores to carry inhumanely produced eggs.<br />
<div style="text-align: center;">...</div><br />
The bill's supporters frame the measure as a consumer choice issue, arguing that the most economically destitute Iowans deserve access to lower priced eggs.<br />

<p>And if you weren't aware of the inhumane treatment of chickens...</p>

<blockquote>
The cages were about the size of a microwave, with seven to 10 hens crammed into each one. The floors were made of an abrasive wire mesh, so when birds died -- often from thirst or starvation after their confinement had debilitated their muscles and bones, rendering them paralyzed -- the live hens would stand on top of the decaying carcasses to give their feet some relief. Workers like Carlson were responsible for removing the trampled carcasses.

<p>"We called it 'pulling carpets,'" he said.<br />
<div style="text-align: center;">...</div><br />
"It was common at the places I worked to find hens whose wings, legs, necks, and prolapsed ova became caught in the wires, condemning them to excruciating, prolonged deaths by dehydration or trampling by their cage-mates," Carlson told The Intercept in an email. The "ova" that he refers to is the chicken equivalent of a uterus, which commonly prolapses because they are bred to produce so many eggs. "When I pointed this out to my supervisor and offered to help untangle some of the hens, I was told this wasn't our job and should wait until they died to remove them," Carlson added.<br />

<blockquote>
Speaking to a shareholder meeting in September, James Debney, the CEO of of American Outdoor, expressed excitement about the "change in the demographic" of those buying the company's gun. "Many more younger people from urban areas versus older people from rural areas, let's say, are showing a strong interest in the shooting sports," Debney said.

<p>Debney credits "savvy marketing" for American Outdoor's success in luring first-time buyers, noting that young consumers have a strong interest in self defense and going to firing ranges that are increasingly opening in urban areas. "Younger people," Debney said, describing the demographics of new customers, "millennials coming through strongly. And then, also, many more women showing an interest in the shooting sports."<br />
<div style="text-align: center;">...</div><br />
At the Bank of America Leveraged Finance Conference in November, the CFO of one of the largest companies involved in gun accessories and ammunition was explicit about the video-game appeal to young gun enthusiasts. "It has become a recreational shooting market, partly driven by the Xbox generation coming of age," said Stephen Nolan, of Vista Outdoor. "And two trends which bode very well to the market long term: significant influx of younger shooters and significant influx of female shooters into the market." Younger shooters, he explained, look to buy paper targets of zombies or vampires, and are more interested in buying high volumes of ammunition.</p>

<p>THE NRA, WHICH is funded by gun manufacturers, has long maintained youth outreach programs. The group sponsors high school gun clubs around the country, including one with the JROTC program attended by Nikolas Cruz, the Parkland shooter. The group sponsors a number of programs for high school-level shooters, including the NRA's Youth Education Summit, which has events all around the country for young gun enthusiasts.<br />
<div style="text-align: center;">...</div><br />
There are indications that the gun industry is making inroads. In a recent Marist poll, a majority of all age groups supported stricter gun rules. But people between 18 and 39 years old, the youngest grouping surveyed, favored stricter gun rules by a smaller percentage -- 64 percent, versus a national average of 71 percent -- than the other age groups.<br />

ONE OF THE same banks that drove the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or PREPA, into the red will now be paid to help auction it off to the highest bidder.

<p>Citigroup Global Markets Inc., or Citi, will be the main investment bank consultant in the restructuring and privatization of PREPA, the Washington-appointed Fiscal Control Board -- the body now overseeing Puerto Rico's finances -- announced recently. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló first announced the move toward privatization last month.<br />
<div style="text-align: center;">...</div><br />
Citi is responsible for having underwritten large chunks of the utility's $9 billion in debt, and at one point owned at least hundreds of millions of dollars in PREPA bonds directly, according to an analysis from the Action Center on Race and the Economy. Citi "has been profiting from helping push Puerto Rico over the edge for a long time," said Carrie Sloan, ACRE's research director.<br />

                        <font class="text">
                              <blockquote>
Janus is the third case to come before the Supreme Court in five years involving public-sector unions' ability to collect "fair share" (or "agency") fees. As this report will show, Janus, and the two fair share cases that preceded it, did not grow from an organic, grassroots challenge to union representation. Rather, the fair share cases are being financed by a small group of foundations with ties to the largest and most powerful corporate lobbies. These organizations and the policymakers they support have succeeded in advancing a policy agenda that weakens the bargaining power of workers. In Janus, these interests have focused their attack on public-sector workers--the workforce with the highest union density.
<div style="text-align: center;">...</div>
The possibility that workers could decide not to pay for the union benefits they receive if fair share fees are outlawed does not mean that they do not value these benefits. This proposition was explained in an amici curiae brief to assist the Supreme Court in understanding the free-rider problem at issue in Janus v. AFSCME, which was signed by 36 distinguished economists and professors of economics and law, including three Nobel laureates. The scholars explained that the free-rider problem is a well-established concept in economics. In particular, the brief shows it is widely accepted that if an individual chooses not to pay for a resource provided to him or her for free, it does not mean the individual does not value the resource, and that when individuals who benefit from a resource do not pay for it, the resource will be underprovided.

<p>For example, as the brief points out, a recent union recertification election in Iowa revealed that a majority of workers in the bargaining unit voted in favor of continuing to be represented by the union, even though most of them also opted out of paying fair share fees.<br />
<div style="text-align: center;">...</div><br />
Many of the organizations financing the legal challenges to workers' rights have also been funding legislative battles focused on limiting workers' rights. How do these groups benefit by limiting workers' rights? Anti-worker policies shift a greater share of economic gains to corporate players and away from ordinary workers. This is evident in the relationship between declining union membership and rising inequality. As union membership has fallen over the last few decades, the share of income going to the top 10 percent has steadily increased.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>It's a bit of a long read but maps out how these wealthy corporate groups have been chipping away at unions over the years.</p>

                              <blockquote>
The thrust of any guestworker proposals that may arise will be to widen the essentially lawless zone in the labor market that has been carved out by the proliferation of temporary work visa programs, which put American and permanent immigrant workers into competition with temporary migrants who are denied all opportunity to bargain meaningfully for higher wages. This week's debate in the Senate should prioritize providing a path to citizenship for DREAMers, not opportunistically expanding the share of workers in America who are not protected by labor standards.

<p>As the Los Angeles Times recently suggested, there may be an attempt to include a bill from Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) that would triple the number of college-educated temporary migrant workers who are employed in the H-1B visa program--a flawed guestworker program used mainly to outsource jobs in information technology and send high-tech jobs offshore. Hatch's bill is known as I-Squared, and although Hatch is trying to sell it as an increase in "merit-based" immigration, it is primarily an attempt to increase the number of temporary migrant workers the tech industry can hire at low wages.<br />

Additionally, you can read a <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-bennet-new-york-times-transcript_us_5a8ec6d5e4b077f5bfebfac7?6mr" target="_blank">transcript</a> of the meeting.  And one of the questions was why aren't there any voices representing the Bernie wing, and the response is unintelligible and ultimately ends with a cry for help, as if finding such people is an impossibility.</p>

<blockquote><strong>NYT employee:</strong> It's a follow-up to something kind of earlier. You identified that you're having trouble finding new voices, and that a lot of the problems you've identified seem to be that we just don't have people representing certain positions. During the election you had no strong advocate for [Sen.] Bernie Sanders [I-Vt.], or any of those positions. And so I guess, in the more recent months, in your attempts to find those voices, where have you been looking, what types of people have you been looking for, and how are you trying to get a more diverse group of people regularly writing in the op-ed section?

<p><strong>Bennet:</strong> I think we need, and you know, I'm sorry if I'm going to talk in code a little bit here, but I'm not talking about ideology necessarily. I'm talking about identity, as well. What columnists do, you know, again, highly intellectually honest, highly entertaining, highly interesting writers who have a lot to say -- hard to find those people from the get-go. What a columnist is is a trusted voice in your ear that helps you process, kind of, the world in real time, right? Through a particular lens. And there are a number of lenses we're missing right now, I think. And a lot of those are, it's gender and it's identity, you know, as well as ideology.</p>

<p>So where am I looking? I'm asking, I'm asking you guys. You know, send me names, please. You know, if there are people that you're reading that you think belong in The New York Times. You know, please. I always, when I was at The Atlantic, I always kept a list of Atlantic writers who didn't work for The Atlantic, just who felt like -- I was at The Atlantic magazine before I came back to the Times, and there was a particular kind of, not that dissimilar from the kind of people we're looking for now, with voice. And I could see them on other platforms and they just didn't know that they were Atlantic people yet, but they were. And I don't have as good a list now as I did then. It might be my own failing. Earlier I blamed the environment for that. But I'm taking nominations.  </p>

<p>I've been... if I could, this is what I would be spending 90 percent of my time on. Because hiring in general, and I'm sure you guys feel this, too, is the most important thing that we do. Like, that's the most important editing we do, is picking the people. After that, you know, you ideally cut them loose to do their thing. In reality, I'm spending a small percentage of my time on this. So I would love help. So please send your nominations my way.</blockquote></p>

<p>By the way, this was in December, so if he did get such nominations, he hasn't acted on them yet.</p>

<blockquote>
Thirty-three-year-old Daryush Valizadeh, known to his predominantly heterosexual male fan base as Roosh, is a well-known pick-up artist within the worldwide "Seduction Community," which relies on pop evolutionary psychology to teach the art of getting laid. Its origins date back to dubious neuro-linguistic programming "speed seduction" theories in the early 1990s, but the Community rose to prominence with investigative reporter Neil Strauss's 2005 bestseller exposé The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists, which spawned a VH1 reality show and drew aspiring "PUAs" to online forums and self-proclaimed gurus promising foolproof seduction strategies.

<p>Pick-up artists believe that all women are the same: submissive, choosier than men when picking sexual partners, entranced by shiny objects. In the Community, players are self-made; most renowned pick-up artists claim they were socially awkward losers until they learned the tricks of the trade. If a pick-up artist hones his "inner game" (confidence) as well as his "outer game" (appearance), he can control his sexual future. When women come with cheat codes, rejection is not an option; if a play fails, the player tweaks his strategy instead of conceding defeat.<br />
<div style="text-align: center;">...</div><br />
But Roosh's Denmark directory diverges from his usual frat-boy Casanova fantasies liberally seasoned with rape jokes. Don't Bang Denmark--note the dramatic title change--is a cranky volume that (spoiler alert!) probably won't help any Roosh acolytes score. Roosh calls it the "most angry book" he's ever written. "This book is a warning of how bad things can get for a single man looking for beautiful, feminine, sexy women."</p>

<p>What's blocking the pussy flow in Denmark? The country's excellent social welfare services. Really.<br />
