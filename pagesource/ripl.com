It takes NO time at all to prepare a graphic and promote it! You can even create, promote and track all in one place now.  The best part is it's animated, our previous content was all static.&#8221;<small><img src="images/say_clevett.jpg" class="img-circle screen" alt="Paul Clevett, Owner of Love and Design" width="50" style="float:left;" />Paul Clevett, Owner of Love and Design</small>

      <h3 >Introduction</h3>

      <p >This Privacy Policy is designed to inform you about the information Ripl, Inc. ("Ripl", "we", or "our")
        collects at www.ripl.com, any successor sites thereto, and any interactive features (such as applications and
        widgets) that provide an authorized link to this Privacy Policy (collectively and individually the "Ripl
        Service"). This Privacy Policy applies whether the Ripl Service is accessed via personal computers, mobile
        devices, tablets, or otherwise.</p >

      <p >This Privacy Policy explains why we collect information about you and how we use information we learn about
        you when you visit the Ripl Service. This Privacy Policy will also provide you with instructions on what to do
        if you don't want to share your personal information with Ripl when you visit the Ripl Service. Your use of
        the Ripl Service signifies you have read our Privacy Policy and assented to it. If you do not agree to this
        Privacy Policy, your sole option is to immediately discontinue use of the Ripl Service.</p >

      <p >We reserve the right, at our complete discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy
        Policy from time to time. We will not, however, retroactively change how we share your personal information
        without your consent. Please check back periodically for any changes we may make to the Privacy Policy, as your
        continued use of the Ripl Service following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy means you accept
        these changes.</p >
    </li >

    <li >
      <h3 >Personal Information We Collect and Use</h3 >

      <p >We ask you for the personal information we need to provide the service you've requested or agreed to receive,
        enable you to participate in Ripl Service features, tailor the content you see when you visit the Ripl Service,
        process your registration, respond to your questions or other requests, improve and manage the Ripl Service, contact
        you with regard to your use of the Ripl Service and for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your personal
        information or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy or with your consent.</p >

      <p ><span class="underline" >Cookies</span >. Cookies are used on the Ripl Service. A "cookie" is a small file
        that we save on your computer's hard drive that contains non-personal information. Our cookies help to give you faster access to pages you have
        already visited, allow you to personalize your pages, and help you to participate in activities or events on the Ripl
        Service. They also assist us in customizing our offerings to you. Cookies do not contain any personal
        information about a specific user, other than their IP address. We do not use cookies to collect information specifically
        about you for sharing with third parties.</p >

      <p ><span class="underline" >Web Beacons</span >. Web beacons are small graphic images or other programming code
        (also known as "1×1 GIFS" or "clear GIFs"). We may include web beacons in the Ripl Service pages and email messages. Web beacons may be used for a
        number of purposes, including to count visitors to the Ripl Service, to monitor how users navigate the Ripl
        Service, and to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened.</p >

      <p ><span class="underline" >Information You Share With Us</span ><br />
        When you interact with the Ripl Service, if applicable, you may set up your personal profile, form friendships,
        send messages, perform searches and queries, add content, and transmit information through various channels. We
        may retain this information so that, for instance, you can return to view prior information you have sent or easily
        see what your friends are posting. Any information you share in public areas, such as message boards, status updates, or feedback sections become
        public, and therefore this Privacy Policy does not apply to such information. Please be careful about what you
        disclose and do not share in public areas any personal information that you expect to keep private.</p >

      <p ><span class="underline" >Tell-A-Friend Services</span ><br />
        If we adopt (and you choose to use) an invitation service to tell a friend about the Ripl Service or features
        thereon, we will ask you for information needed to send the invitation, such as your friend's email address. We
        will automatically send your friend a one-time email or message inviting him or her to visit the Ripl Service. Ripl
        stores this information only as long as needed to send this one-time invitation and to track the success of our
        referral program. Your friend may contact us at support at ripl.com to request that we remove this information from
        our database.</p >
    </li >

    <li >
      <h3 >Sharing of Information</h3 >

      <p > We may share non-personally identifiable information, such as aggregated user statistics, with third parties.
        We do not share your personal information with third parties for third-party marketing purposes. We may share the
        information we have collected about you, including personal information, as disclosed at the time you provide
        your information and in the following circumstances:
      </p >

      <p > <span class="underline">Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf</span>. We may use third parties to perform certain services on
        behalf of the Ripl Service, such as hosting the Ripl Service, designing and/or operating the Ripl Service features, and
        enabling Ripl to send you email newsletters or performing other administrative services. We may provide these
        companies with access to user information, including personal information, to carry out the services they are
        performing for you or for us. While we may use: (a) third-party analytics service providers to evaluate and
        provide information about the use of the Ripl Service and viewing of our content and (b) ad-serving platforms, we do
        not share personal information with either of these types of entities. However, analytic service providers and
        ad-serving platforms may set and access their own cookies and web beacons on your device and they may otherwise
        collect or have access to limited information about you, including usage information.
      </p >

      <p ><span class="underline">Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions</span>. We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (each, a
        "Promotion") through the Ripl Service that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you agree to the
        terms, conditions and/or official rules that govern that Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, personal
        information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such
        Promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or
        permitted by the Promotion's official rules, such as on a winners' list.</p>

      <p><span class="underline">Administrative and Legal Reasons</span>. We may also disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in
        the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to applicable law or comply with legal process
        served on us; and (b) protect and defend our rights or property, the Ripl Service, its users, or the public.
      </p >

      <p ><span class="underline">Business Transfer</span>. We reserve the right to disclose and transfer all information related to the Ripl Service,
        including, without limitation, your personal information, demographic information and usage information: (i) to
        a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Ripl Service or applicable database; or (ii) in connection with a
        corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our stock and/or assets or
        other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process.</p >
    </li >
    <li >
      <h3 >Security</h3 >

      <p >Personal information collected via the Ripl Service is stored in secure operating environments that are not
        available to the public. In some instances, personal information is encrypted during storage and transmission.
        Only those Ripl employees and agents who need access to your Personal Information to do their jobs are allowed
        access, each having signed confidentiality agreements.</p >

      <p >While we make reasonable efforts to safeguard your Personal Information once we receive it, no transmission of
        data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot ensure
        or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or information we transmit to you from the Ripl
        Service, and you assume all related risks.</p ></li >

    <li >
      <h3 >Cross-Border Transfer</h3 >

      <p >The Ripl Service is intended solely for US visitors. You agree that any personal information you provide to
        us will be processed and stored on servers in the US, the laws of which may be deemed by other countries to have
        inadequate data protection. Accordingly, if you are located outside the US, you consent and continue to consent to the
        processing and storage of such data in the US and you warrant that such processing and storage will not violate
        any country's data-security and data-transfer laws including the European Union Safe Harbor Director and local
        implementations thereof.</p ></li >

    <li >
      <h3 >Contact Us</h3 >
