                <p>What if I have issues uninstalling? As mentioned above, we work very hard to make uninstalling as easy as possible. However, there are times when third party programs, such as security programs or uninstall utilities prevent this from happening. It is sad, but true that some security programs allow the installation of <strong><i>SHH-EARCH</i></strong>, but block our uninstaller. It is very annoying (to us and you) and when this occurs we work with these companies to unblock our application. However, in the interim, this may cause error messages or prevent the uninstaller from working normally. The easiest solution is to temporarily disable the blocking software or use Windows Safe Mode to allow the uninstall process to complete.</p>
                <p>If you still have issues, please let us know – we are more than happy to help. Please share as much information including screenshots, error messages and any other specifics that will help us guide you to a solution. <a href="mailto:support@shh-earch.com">support@shh-earch.com</a></p>
