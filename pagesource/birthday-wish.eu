How to correctly make birthday wishes?</h2>
<p>wishes for birthdayBirthday is a special day of the year. Then we sum up the past year, we think about what we have achieved, and what else we have to wait for. The older we are, the more we feel the passage of time. However, every jubilarian awaits wishes on that day. Wishes for birthday should be made in a sincere, cordial and heartfelt way. Many people also have a problem how to write birthday wishes . In the following text I will try to bring it closer.</p>
<h2>Birthday wishes</h2>
<p>We celebrate our birthday on the anniversary of the day we were born. In Poland, this custom usually involves fun, making wishes and giving presents to the solenizer. An inseparable element of birth is a cake on which we put as many candles as the jubilarian and singing the song &#8220;Hundred Years&#8221;.</p>
<h2>How to make birthday wishes?</h2>
<p>Birthday wishes are best submitted in person. This form is the best seen. We should look at the man in the eyes and squeeze his hand as a proof of kindness. Giving a hand with big tactlessness would be to look sideways &#8211; this is perceived as disrespect for the other person. On the other hand, often we do not have such a physical possibility to meet personally with the student on that day. Then it remains a birthday wish to submit in a different form. You can send them using:</p>
<ul>
<li>phone &#8211; we can call and make a birthday greeting by phone or write a short text and send it in a sms;</li>
<li>e-mail &#8211; we can attach a photo or a picture to the wishes by e-mail;</li>
<li>traditional mail &#8211; when the recipient receives a card in such a way, it will definitely be pleasantly surprised; remember to send it in advance so that it arrives on time; the cards show a lot of work &#8211; you have</li>
<li>to buy them, unsubscribe and send them, so nowadays this form of wishes will be remembered for a long time;</li>
<li>social networking sites &#8211; this is an increasingly popular form of making wishes. In addition, social networks, such as Facebook, have the option of setting a birthday reminder. Thanks to this, every friend will</li>
<li>see that on that day the birthday is celebrated.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, in this form for birthday wishes we make without any thought and wholesale.</p>
<h3>Wishes for birthdays &#8211; what to avoid</h3>
<p>The content of the wishes is indicative of the attitude towards the addressee. If we download them from the internet, and what&#8217;s worse, we will not change the form (that is, when we make a wish to a woman, we will copy the text in a masculine form), the solenizer may feel offended. Even the usual formulas &#8220;Happy Birthday &#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;Health, happiness, prosperity &#8230;&#8221; can be expanded in such a way that a student would feel that these birthday wishesthey are directed directly to him. Please note that generally the formula always slightly modified &#8211; the wishes should see our character and orientation specifically for the person. That wishes would suit him, and that they would reflect his personality and life. Birthday wishes should be honest and straight from the heart. If we know the addressee well and know what he wants, we should not hesitate to wish him that. Simply put &#8211; let us make such wishes that we would like to receive. It&#8217;s a big tactic to confuse the date of birth. Before making a wish, we should make sure that it is today they fall out.</p>
<h2>How to write birthday wishes?</h2>
<p>Some people find it difficult to write honest wishes. Even if we know and like a given person, we may have a problem with it anyway. So how to write birthday wishes? A typical birthday wish arrangement is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>wording, e.g. &#8220;On the day of birth &#8230;&#8221;,</li>
<li>content of wishes,</li>
<li>end of the text, e.g. &#8220;Wishes&#8221;, &#8220;With best wishes&#8221;,</li>
<li>signature. This form can be used when writing a text message or sending a message on social networks. However, if we decide to send a postcard by traditional mail, we can use the following diagram:<br />
place and date,</li>
<li>return to the recipient, e.g. &#8220;Dear Mateusz&#8221;, &#8220;Dear Mark&#8221;,</li>
<li>content of wishes,</li>
<li>formula &#8220;Wishes&#8221;, &#8220;Wishes wishes&#8221;,</li>
<li>signature<br />
It is also better to send very simple birthday wishes, for example &#8220;I wish you all the best on the occasion of my birthday, a lot of health, happiness, love and fulfilling my most secret dreams&#8221; than using the &#8220;copy-paste&#8221; formula. However, if you decide to use the Internet, it is worth choosing such wishes that will match the student, not the first better from the bank. On the Internet we find a lot of pages with ready-made wishes &#8211; we can enter in the web browser, for example: &#8220;wishes for birthdays&#8221;, &#8220;birthday wishes&#8221;, &#8220;for birthday wishes&#8221;, &#8220;how to write birthday wishes&#8221; &#8211; for sure we will have a choice .</li>
</ul>
<h4>To whom are the wishes addressed?</h4>
<p>The nature of wishes may be different in relation to the person to whom they are addressed. Otherwise, we will give birthday wishes to a friend, or sister, or grandmother, mother, and yet another way to husband / wife, child. The closest family can make wishes in a loose, spontaneous form. However, for birthday, the wishes made to the elderly have a slightly different, more sophisticated form. Keep in mind that a person who approaches the hundredth birthday, do not wish 100 years, only &#8211; 200 years. For birthday, let&#8217;s give wishes first of all with a smile and honesty.</p>
<p>Most of us have a problem how to write birthday wishes. Remember to do it from the heart. Wishes for birthday should be made honestly and with a smile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Birthday wishes &#8211; worth knowing and interesting</p>
<p>Birthday wishes or greetings as well as birthday sayings are part of every birthday, like cakes and candles. They are elemental and are as different as the birthday children to whom the author has addressed them. There are serious, funny, modern, classic, encouraging and admonishing sayings and wishes for the cradle party. Of course, it always depends on the one who has a birthday and the frame. An 18th birthday requires the author to congratulate another saying than a 60th birthday . Of course, both of them can be written in a funny way and, for example, tell greetings from the youth, but of course a 60th birthday offers many more starting points.</p>
<p>The tradition of birthday greetings and wishes on a birthday card is almost as old as the birthday party itself. In ancient Rome or Greece, the cradle party was celebrated to call guardian spirits who were supposed to protect the birthday child from anything bad. There were also gifts that were intended as offerings to the guardian spirits. Even then there were birthday greetings, birthday sayings or poems. The feast day was not a family event, but was celebrated by a group of people who had cradles on the same day. And that was not even once a year, but monthly. But there were also birthday parties of rulers who were celebrated, such as those of the pharaohs in ancient Egypt. That would be comparable to the celebration of the Queen today in the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Although the special day was very different from today, the custom has existed for a long time and has evolved. The idea behind it may have changed, but the presents, birthday greetings and birthday sayings have remained. You want to tell a loved one that you value him, that you care about him, and how happy you are to have him. For a birthday celebration may also be a good occasion with a nice birthday card. It is a summary of the personal last year, where everyone gathers and celebrates the beginning of a new one. This applies to the family as well as to friends.</p>
<p>There are special anniversaries to which we attach more weight than others. The 18th birthday , 21st birthday,30th birthday or 50th birthday for example. At the age of 18, you become an adult, you switch from adolescent to adult. This goes hand in hand with big duties but also with great opportunities. You are allowed to drive, drink and vote. At age 21 you will reach the age of majority in other countries and you will not be a teenager anymore. All rounds are classically celebrated big. Of course, great birthday wishes should not be missed!</p>
<p>Not all countries celebrate the same. Not the same birthdays. In Latin America, for example, the girls&#8217; 15th birthday is celebrated with a really festive party. In smaller villages or communities, everyone is invited and eating, drinking and celebrating together. It is often spent an annual salary or more for the celebration. The dresses of the girls are particularly pompous and conspicuous and are only worn on this one day. In Asia, on the other hand, the special day is often celebrated together with many others on the New Year. The tradition of celebrating on its actual birthday date has not existed there for a long time. Many Arab countries do not know the tradition of the birthday party. In some countries, not even the exact birthday date is known. The details in the card are then maximum estimates.</p>
<p>But no matter what birthday, congratulations, birthday greetings or birthday sayings the author needs every year again. It does not always have to be incredibly creative or funny and original. The main thing is that the birthday greetings or birthday sayings fit the cradle party and come from the heart. Here also gestures or gifts can express the birthday wishes. As you know, flowers say more than a thousand words, but even a home-baked cake with slate glaze and dripping candles testifies to affection. And that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about. As long as the jubilarian likes it, everything is allowed that gives pleasure.</p>
<p>To personalize birthday greetings or birthday sayings, think twice about what makes him special, what he has for character traits, and what milestones in his life or last year have been. So you can relate to achievements, such as climbing a mountain, or to important events, such as the birth or birth of the child. Likewise, fancy journeys or memorable moments are a great way to reflect on the congratulations on the birthday card. So you notice quickly on properties that you especially appreciate the one or the one and would like to emphasize in a birthday wish.</p>
<p>The birthday wishes or greetings on the birthday card are usually accompanied with a gift by the writer. This can be something material, or a coupon or a gift of money. Especially the big birthdays give occasion for unusual gifts. It does not depend on perfection, but on a funny or very nice packaging. So you can make gifts of money a highlight by individually packaging them. That can be coins in an ice block, behind glass or in a pi&ntilde;ata, anything that pleases. Of course, the gifts can sometimes be something completely different, by lots being distributed or sold with friendly services. Thus, the recipient of each receives an immaterial gift, such as an invitation to eat or a lawn mowing voucher, which can be distributed over a longer period of time. This is especially suitable for birthday children who have almost everything.</p>
<p>A great and funny way to congratulate someone on their birthday and wrap their own congratulations is a speech or a poem. This is best kept in front of the other guests and should be as happy as possible and designed with humor. You can tell something from the past, the first encounter, for example, or say something about the preferences and traits of the birthday child. But you should always do it in such a way that you do not feel attacked, but prefer to portray something humorous. A speech does not have to rhyme, but if you find some funny rhymes, so much the better. But you can also rewrite existing poems, so they fit the anniversary, or the anniversary. Who does not dare to recite the poem or the speech, or can not be present at a birthday, He can write the speech on a nice sheet or card and send it. So you can give away something very personal.</p>
<p>What is missing on any birthday is a serenade. A birthday song is the set version of the birthday wishes. Especially when singing is: Not the quality counts, but the love with which is sung. It may be crooked and crooked as long as the Besungene knows that it comes from the heart. This can be classics, such as &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; or &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221;, but also funny children&#8217;s birthday songs, which are learned in kindergarten, are a great idea. And especially older ones are happy about a nursery rhyme, because on his birthday everyone is a birthday child.</p>
<p>For larger celebrations, there is also the tradition of umgestichteten songs. Then a well-known song is re-written, so that it becomes a funny anecdote from the life of the birthday boy. For that you need a bit of creativity and instinct. But even if it does not work out that way or it becomes a shout: It&#8217;s always a great gift.</p>
<p>Birthday wishes can therefore take on almost any form. It does not matter if they come as a card, as a letter, as a self-picked bouquet of flowers with cards, sung, or as a sugar note on a cake: birthday wishes are simply a must on every birthday! Ultimately, we would like to say that we appreciate those who are happy to have him or her and perhaps even thank us for the years we have spent together. That can also say a &#8220;happy birthday&#8221;, but often we need or want to say more and unfortunately we are missing the right words.</p>
<p>Exactly for such moments you will find a rich repertoire of sayings, quotes, poems and suggestions for your very own birthday wishes. Just pick a phrase from our extensive collection that suits the anniversary and what you want him to do. Now you need a card, a letter, a text message or an e-mail with which you would like to convey your congratulations. Of course, other things are suitable as a greeting card, for example, a cake, a picture, a great wine bottle or something tinkered by the children or grandchildren. You can end your congratulations with a personal greeting or a few words. So you get your completely successful and individual birthday wishes, matching the congratulations. The joy is guaranteed!</p>	</div>
