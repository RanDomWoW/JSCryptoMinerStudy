                    <p>The freedom to move around as you want.  The ability to make money on your terms.  The long list of high-paying clients that think of you as their no.1 guy.</p>

                    <p>Did I mention that client list before?  <span class="under"><b>Because that's the secret,</b></span> and this is where you finally find out how to get it.</p>

                    <p>I did all the usual things the gurus say.</p>

                    <p>I went into Google and listed every lead I could find.  I called them all up trying to sell them all kinds of services.</p>

                    <p>…and it bombed.</p>

                    <p>I'd phone people up and be told they didn't want my services, they didn't need my services, and how dare I bother them?</p>

                    <p>And one day, I just couldn't do it.  I sat staring at myself in the mirror, wondering why I was doing all this.</p>

                    <p>That was when it finally clicked.  That morning, I sketched out the process my business has run by ever since.</p>

                    <p>It's to look for the RIGHT leads.</p>

                    <p>With them, you can quickly grow an offline business that pulls in four to five figures a month.</p>

                    <p>But what does 'the right leads' mean?</p>

                    <p>It means finding, accessing, and targeting ONLY the leads that are in DESPERATE NEED of your services.</p>

                    <p>Makes sense, right? Why waste time on anything else? </p>

                    <section>
                    <p>What would one easy close with a single high ticket client mean to you? </p>

                    <p>How much less stressful would business be with just a single monthly retainer? </p>

                    <p>How much better will business be when the people you approach are actually happy to hear from you? </p>

                    <p>I'm willing to wager the answer to all three of those questions is "a lot." </p>

                    <p><b>You've seen what ScopeLeads can do.</b> </p>

                    <p>And remember, this isn't a one hit wonder… this is a bit of software that'll help run your business and generate hot leads all day every day. </p>

                    <p>And when a single lead could be worth $2000/month, I think you'll agree the public price of $67/month is more than fair. </p>

                    <p>It's not one of those shoddy lead scrapers that'll create more work for you. And it's not promising to make you a millionaire tomorrow morning. That's not why you're buying it. You're clever enough to know push button riches don't exist. </p>

                    <p>What ScopeLeads does do… <b>is exactly what I promised:</b> </p>

                    <p>Create a list of high value clients in need of your services, and connect you with them in a way that makes selling easy… </p>

                    <p><b>So here's what I'd like you to do:</b> </p>

                    <p>Take a look at it, use it for 30 days, more than enough time for you to generate hundreds of leads and close some big clients…</p>

                    <p>If for any reason you find ScopeLeads doesn't work as promised… even if it's just because you didn't have time to make the most of it yet… contact me within 30 days and I'll rush you a full refund. </p>

                    <p>No questions ask. No hassle. No hard feelings. </p>

                    <p>Can't say fairer than that, right?</p>

                    <p>This isn't about software. It's about life. Life and Business. </p>

                    <p>This is about knowing that wherever you want to be, whatever niche you want to dominate, and however you want to run your business… <b>you'll ALWAYS have a red-hot list of prospects on tap.</b> </p>

                    <p>The kind of prospects that you don't even need to sell to. </p>

                    <p>Trust me here…</p>

                    <p>This simple knowledge, and the sense of financial security it brings, is the secret to my permanent vacation. And <b>I fully believe, it can be your ticket too.</b> </p>

                    <p>Knowing that all you have to do is enter a keyword and your home town (wherever that may be) and by the time they've brought your morning coffee, you'll be looking a list FULL of the best local leads.</p>

                    <p>Picture this: finding a list of prospects through ScopeLeads.  Sending an email out to introduce yourself in one-click. Getting in touch with your first lead… and having them DELIGHTED that you did.  </p>

                    <p>Sounds good to you? </p>

                    <p>You bet it does.  </p>

                    <p>ScopeLeads makes picking up new clients as easy as picking up groceries from the store. </p>

                    <p>When I started out I took a big risk by going it alone. Thankfully, it paid off.  And now I'm lucky enough to be able to <b>remove all the risk for you.</b> </p>

                    <p>Not only do you get access when you invest in ScopeLeads today, but you're fully covered by the 30-day guarantee.  </p>

                    <p>If you want to take your business to a brand new level today, all you have to do is hit that button below now.</p>
