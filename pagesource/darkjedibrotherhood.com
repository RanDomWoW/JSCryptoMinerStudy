<h4 id="greetings-all">Greetings all,</h4>

<p>A relatively short report today, as I&#39;ve spent the weekend working and am heading to bed soon.  This report is without an Ask the Grand Master section - but have no fear, my intention is to alternate reports where I take questions.  </p>

<p>Several important announcements coming today, including the introduction of our new Herald. I&#39;m also announcing my Magistrate, and providing a few general thoughts and messages from the Dark Council.  I&#39;m also going to start connecting people interested in renaming some of our ranks, so if that&#39;s of interest, definitely read on.  Finally, I&#39;ve got a quick task I need a member to cover for me, which I will describe below. </p>

<h5 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h5>

<p>-A New Herald<br/>
-M:GM Announced<br/>
-Fictional update Soon (TM)<br/>
-Promotion checklists<br/>
-Improving the Brotherhood: An Emphasis on Quaestors<br/>
-Rank Renames?<br/>
-Quick Task: Major Timing of Star Wars Releases  </p>

<h4 id="the-new-herald">The New Herald</h4>

<p>We had a set of excellent applications, and the decision on the next Herald was as difficult a choice as I can remember for the position.  It is a testament to the hard work that the Deputy Grand Master has put in that our Herald&#39;s office has such strong candidates to replace him.  Ultimately, I have decided to appoint <strong>Dark Adept Selika Roh</strong>, the current Consul of Clan Plagueis and Wiki Tribune.  The choice came down to his ability to lead a diverse group of members after serving admirably as a Consul, and his desire to continue to build an inclusive graphics community.  Please, take time to congratulate Selika Roh, our new Herald, and I want to offer a personal thank you to all of our excellent applicants that made this such a tough choice. </p>

<p>We will provide an update on Clan Plagueis&#39; Consul position, as well as Wiki Tribune, in the coming days.</p>

<h4 id="magistrate-to-the-grand-master">Magistrate to the Grand Master</h4>

<p>I have decided to name <a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/members/12946">Laren Uscot</a> as my Magistrate.  He has already begun work on cataloging some of out most out of date policy pages, and we&#39;ll note any major changes to the membership.  As any member that has browsed our Codex knows, there&#39;s a lot of information lacking and outdated - and this is one of the first places we will start!  </p>

<p>Laren rounds out my staff right now, but I may open another Magistrate position in the future.  In the mean time, if you&#39;re looking for opportunities, <a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/news/reports-taldryan-consul-report-3-1">Clan Taldryan needs a Proconsul</a>, <a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/news/djb-news-cns-house-shar-dakhan-quaestor-aedile-required-clan-naga-sadow-rollmaster-required-too">Clan Naga Sadow has a few openings</a>, and <a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/news/djb-news-imperium-quaestor-open-to-applications">House Imperium in CSP is looking for a Quaestor</a>.  And of course, there&#39;s <a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/news/djb-news-gm-update-social-media-tribune-application-extension">Social Media Tribune!</a></p>

<h4 id="fictional-update-coming-soon">Fictional Update Coming Soon</h4>

<p>I know you&#39;re all waiting for the Epilogue Fiction Update.  It is on the way, and it&#39;ll be here very soon.  There have been some delays due to the change over in GMs, but the Voice is hard at work and you will all have something to sink your teeth into soon.  I agree that the wait time was unacceptable, and the Dark Council is committed to a faster turnaround time on all fictional releases from here on out.  In the mean time, if any Clans are curious if their plans will somehow conflict with the fiction, please do not hesitate to reach out to the Voice.  </p>

<p>And yes... my character sheet is getting some much needed love, too. ;)</p>

<h4 id="emphasizing-quaestors">Emphasizing Quaestors</h4>

<p>Periodically in my reports, I will share my thoughts on a problem we are only just beginning to find solutions for. 
 Today, I&#39;ll briefly discuss the Quaestor position.  Quaestor is one of the most important positions in the Brotherhood, due to the intimate role it has in shaping membership experiences and shepherding members into the wider club community.  I have always felt this position is among our most valuable, but I&#39;ve noticed that it is becoming increasingly hard for our Summits to fill Quaestor positions.  As others have noted, this doesn&#39;t seem to be due to a lack of members wanting to be involved, since there is no shortage of applications to Dark Council staff positions, but rather, a lack of members wanting to be in leadership positions at the House level.  I have heard the argument that newer members are less interested in the hard work that Clan leadership often entails, but I&#39;m skeptical this really explains the current circumstances.  I&#39;ve never been one to believe one generation of members was somehow better or worse than another.  I believe today&#39;s new joins have every bit of potential that members two, four, ten, and twenty years ago had.  </p>

<p>Instead, I wonder if it is an issue with the perceived rewards for being a Quaestor.  There was a time when Quaestor was a gatekeeper position of sorts, in which a member had to serve in order to advance in the Brotherhood.  While I think something quite this rigid isn&#39;t needed, I intend to take a closer look moving forward on how we can better reward and acknowledge the contributions of our Quaestors.  I have heard from a few leaders, past and present, that felt the contributions of Quaestors were harder to describe/track and thus award.   I also know some of our older members are reluctant to return to Quaestor positions, as they see them as a level too low to help in their advancement.  While there is some truth that the contributions of a Quaestor are at a different level than a Proconsul or Consul, they are none the less integral to our Brotherhood, and I hope to find ways that we can better reflect that in our upcoming Experience System.</p>

<p>Changing the Brotherhood to a place where Quaestor positions are competitive across the club again will take time, but it is a challenge I think is important for the Brotherhood&#39;s long-term growth.  In an effort to increase the visibility of Quaestors, a Clan&#39;s Quaestors have been added to the front of each Clan&#39;s roster page.  Moving forward, we will be exploring ways to gather data on membership impressions of the position&#39;s workload, value, and rewards, as part of a larger emphasis on evaluating positions within our House and Clan structures to improve membership experience.  </p>

<h4 id="potential-to-rename-order-ranks">Potential to Rename Order Ranks</h4>

<p>As has come up repeatedly, there&#39;s some interest in renaming one or more ranks from various Orders.  I&#39;d like to put together a few people interested in this area from a diverse background - even those that like all of the rank names.  I know that the Gray and the Mercenary rank names are a favorite target of folks&#39; ire!  If you&#39;d like to be involved in renaming ranks, shoot me an email.  This is relatively informal at this point, and I have some specific goals and themes in mind (No Grey Wardens, Atty!), but I know there&#39;s some interest here and I&#39;m happy to hear some new ideas.  </p>

<h4 id="quick-task-1-major-timing-of-star-wars-releases">Quick Task #1: Major Timing of Star Wars Releases</h4>

<p>For my last report, Atra had a cool question on if I had any quick tasks for someone to pick up and do.  Well... this time around, I do.  Today marks my first &#39;Quick Task&#39;, and it&#39;s something I&#39;ll likely have intermittently in different reports as the need arises. The way this works is simple: The first person to email me or message me on Telegram (I will be going by Received timestamps) that they would like the below task will have a week to complete it.  I&#39;ll acknowledge they were the first to get in contact with me, and I&#39;ll then post a comment on this report indicating that this Quick Task has been claimed.  Completion of a Quick Task will be added to a member&#39;s Dossier Activity Notes, which will be usable in promotions and medals, and some tasks may warrant a medal on their own. Don&#39;t start if you don&#39;t hear from me or see a post - I don&#39;t want members wasting their time.  </p>

<p>In order to better understand trends in Join Data, we would like <strong>a list with the dates of all Star Wars movie and game releases, TV show premiere dates (e.g. just the first episode of the series), major Star Wars conventions, and all major (e.g. GJW level) Dark Brotherhood events since 1/1/2010</strong>.  If you have other events you want to toss in there, you may.  <strong>Interested?</strong>  If so, reach out to me... and soon, because I know a few people that will claim this pretty quick.  As detailed above, I&#39;ll respond and let you know if you&#39;re the first to claim the task.  </p>

<p>A note for members on other continents: I will make sure to post these kind of tasks at varying times so that members in different regions and under different schedules have a shot if they&#39;d like.  </p>

<p>Until next time... <strong>May the Force be with you!</strong></p>

<h4 id="greetings-all">Greetings all,</h4>

<p>A quick update before a larger report this weekend, when we will announce the new Herald and I will touch on other important topics to the Brotherhood.</p>

<h4 id="extension-on-applications-for-social-media-tribune">Extension on Applications for Social Media Tribune</h4>

<p>We will be extending applications for Social Media Tribune through to the end of next weekend, as there was a little bit of confusion regarding the position and its requirements.  As such, applications will be due on <strong>3/25</strong>.  To briefly recap, the <strong>Social Media Tribune</strong> will propose and implement a strategy to increase traffic to the Brotherhood website through the use of social media, etc.  This new position is <strong>distinct from Recruitment Tribune</strong>.  I provide greater details in the original posting <a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/news/djb-news-a-new-dgm-and-call-for-applications">here</a>, along with details for applying.  Social Media Tribune is a position we expect will take up a substantial portion of a member&#39;s time, but we expect that members may serve in House or Clan leadership while remaining as Social Media Tribune, as the member will have a support staff as Social Media Tribune.  Moreover, as a Tribune, the member will be an observer on the Dark Summit group and expected to provide regular input on topics related to social media and Brotherhood exposure.  This position is an excellent opportunity for a member to make a mark on the club as a whole, as social media presence has been an area we have lacked for a considerable amount of time.</p>

<p>Please note that this position will be involved with, but will not be solely responsible for, recruitment.  It is primarily tasked with Social Media exposure. Due to the importance of attracting new members to the club, we will be taking a different approach that you will all learn a bit more about soon regarding active recruitment.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for now - look for a larger report on Sunday.</p>

<p>All-  keep reading for an update from Alaris on the current status of the BGL.</p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="https://darkjedibrotherhood.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/assets/assets/000/001/301/original/drac-sep.png?1475879337" alt="div"/></p>

<h2 id="brotherhood-gaming-league-update">Brotherhood Gaming League Update</h2>

<h2 id="heroes-of-the-storm-season-one-round-one">Heroes of the Storm: Season One; Round One</h2>

<p>We are off to the Knock-Out Phase! Congratulations to all of our competitors. There are some small changes for the Knock-Out Phase. Firstly, Varian is no longer considered a Warrior. He is now considered a Melee Assassin. Secondly, the map you will use for the entirety of the Knock-Out Phase is the Cursed Hollow. You can find the bracket <a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/competitions/13362">here</a></p>

<p>May the Curse be with you!</p>

<h3 id="overwatch-season-one-round-one">Overwatch: Season One; Round One</h3>

<p>Sign-ups have closed and we are setting off into the Group Stage. As promised, I have created a schedule for both the PC and PS4 competitions. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vW28ojZREnJLr65uO3evPjPZaJvVTX6r-spVQL6BUww/edit?usp=sharing">You can find them here.</a> Matches can be completed at any time before that date. If a match is not completed by server reset on the day listed it will be put in as a loss for both participants. I will allow ONE extension per competitor of 24 hours. If you can prove a concerted effort to get ahold of your opponent, you will not be saddled with the loss.
PC standings can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-kRWgZhuCNhJTDd6pwC1iSXqXtVAeqrMTzgzZXNVRTk/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
PS4 standings can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PLhI-8lV5eTPYrRExsb6dIaEHRa79DnMsjPOH52BW5g/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to thank Aul for his work as Quaestor of House Shar Dakhan, but he has decided to step down from the role. In addition to that, Jurdan is also stepping back as Aedile of House Shar Dakhan. What does that mean? It means I&#39;m looking for a new Quaestor and Aedile to lead HSD. As such, I&#39;m opening applications to the Club. I&#39;m going to shamelessly steal from Raiju&#39;s recent looking for a new Quaestor post, because it&#39;s pretty good and I have no morals (Sorry, Raiju!).</p>

<p>Again, thank you to Aul and Jurdan for your work and time given to House Shar Dakhan and Clan Naga Sadow! </p>

<h3 id="quaestor-and-aedile-vacancies">Quaestor and Aedile vacancies</h3>

<h4 id="what-does-the-position-entail">What does the position entail?</h4>

<p>You can find out the role and expectations of Quaestor on the wiki, <a href="https://wiki.darkjedibrotherhood.com/view/Quaestor">here</a> We expect similar from our Aediles, but they are mainly supposed to support and learn from the Quaestor. Additionally, take a look at our &quot;what we are looking for in competitive candidates&quot; section, found below. We will also reserve the right to look at Quaestor applications in consideration for the Aedile role. </p>

<h4 id="application-requirements">Application Requirements:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Why are you a fit for this position?</li>
<li>State of the House (Strengths &amp; Weaknesses analysis)</li>
<li>Your leadership philosophy</li>
<li>Plans for the house membership (How to get them involved, activity and input-wise)</li>
<li>Plans for the house fictionally</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-we-are-looking-for-in-competitive-candidates">What we are looking for in competitive candidates:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Must be an active member</li>
<li>Must maintain a good turnaround time on communications (email, Telegram, etc.) with a regular 24-hour response time</li>
<li>Must be willing to promote activity, membership engagement, fictional development, and open lines of communication</li>
<li>Must produce competitions, fictional updates, and be comfortable with updating the Wiki page</li>
<li>Must set a good example for the membership</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="things-considered-an-asset">Things considered an asset:</h4>

<ul>

*An understanding of Markdown (the SA has a course for this too)</li>
<li>Any additional credentials that support your DJB side of the application</li>
<li>Any up front questions you may have</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="due-date">Due date:</h4>

<p>As mentioned earlier, you have until the end of Thursday 29th March to get your applications into Bentre and I. </p>

<hr/>

<h3 id="rollmaster-vacancy">Rollmaster vacancy</h3>

<h4 id="what-does-the-position-entail">What does the position entail?</h4>

<p>I&#39;m also looking for a new Rollmaster. Naga Sadow has gone without a Rollmaster for the past 10 months, as we have experimented in not having one. I will be looking for a Rollmaster that can perform their defined role, along with assisting in producing Clan lore, fiction, storylines and events. You will be expected to use your initiative and see how the role can be expanded. CNS has a reputation of having the best member retention and getting members to DJK. I want to see how we can improve that even further and continue to keep the Clan and club growing. </p>

<h4 id="application-requirements">Application Requirements:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Why are you a fit for this position?</li>
<li>Your leadership philosophy</li>
<li>Plans for the Clan fictionally</li>
<li>Plans to improve member recruitment and retention</li>
</ul>

<li>Any up front questions you may have</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="due-date">Due date:</h4>

<p>Applications close for Rollmaster on Thursday 29th March too. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Please ensure that all applications are clearly marked for the role that you are applying for, example - CNS Rollmaster Application or HSD Quaestor Application. Please also make sure that you include Bentre in the email. Any applications that fail to include Bentre will be ignored. I stress this because I have noticed that former applications have missed him out on occasion. </p>

<p>If you have any questions about the roles, please don&#39;t hesitate to pm me on telegram @sangentar or drop me an email. Again, you have until the end of day on Thursday 29th March 2018 to get your applications in, however we reserve the right to choose and appoint before the closure date if an excellent candidate is identified, so get your apps in sooner rather than later.</p>

<h5 id="citizens-friends-of-the-imperial-clan">Citizens &amp; Friends of the Imperial Clan,</h5>

<p>It&#39;s my unfortunate duty to announce that earlier today Mako let us know that he needed to resign due to personal reasons. While it&#39;s unfortunate that we have lost a strong member from the summit team, I do thank Mako for the chance he gave Imperium and hope to see him return to the team in the future. </p>

<p>That said, <strong>applications for the position of Quaestor of House Imperium are now open DB-wide</strong>. Applications should be e-mailed to <a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/members/5951">Elincia Rei</a>, <a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/members/3607">Mune Cinteroph-Palpatine</a>, &amp; <a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/members/4024">myself</a> - and make sure to include all three or your application won&#39;t be considered.  A PDF, MS Word, or e-mail text box application will be accepted. Do not send a GDoc link; it won’t be opened. It is heavily suggested you do some homework on what you&#39;re getting into, reach out to the Imperium membership, the current leaders, and the clan summit even - ask questions and lots of them. I, likewise, recommend making sure you have a quality app that stands out: get it proofed, hit all the points, and add some of your own flavor - a simple email or comment saying &quot;Hi, can I haz?&quot; is not enough. :D</p>

<p>I held back on a report in February because there were a lot of other things going on with the Brotherhood. In this report, I will talk about the first set of competitions run for the Collective Chronicles, outline my 2018 projects for the Voice Staff, and answer some questions that came up during an #AskTheVoice session in Fiction Chat. Follow me, if you would like to know da wey.</p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="https://darkjedibrotherhood.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/assets/assets/000/001/497/original/Wally-sep.png?1475901378" alt="header"/></p>

<h3 id="news">News</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Last month, I put out a call for a new Magistrate. I was shocked to receive roughly 15 applications, and made a point of responding to each applicant to offer insight into my decisions for who I ultimately picked. I’m pleased to have <strong>Maruo Wynter</strong> join the Voice team as our new Magistrate. He has been cleared for Character Sheet and competition queue work after completing his training and shadowing with the rest of the team. For anyone that I spoke to on the side, or that applied and feels down, please make sure to check out my <strong>Project</strong> section below to see what I am going to need help with.</p></li>
<li><p>For anyone that has been living under a rock, Grand Master Pravus has ended his second stint as GM. He was awarded his <a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/events/177328">second Golden Lightsaber</a>, but I wanted to also quickly thank him as someone who has worked with him since before he was Grand Master, back all the way when he returned to the Dark Council as Voice. Sarin has been at the head of a lot of unpopular but necessary decisions for the club&#39;s fictional direction. Each step of the way, every argument we’ve had, I’ve always been given a reason or explanation for why we have done these things. In the end, he always kept his vision forward, eyes locked on the future, on improving the club in the areas that he saw it lacking. For that, I am eternally grateful, and hope to rise to his level as a leader in this organization and to some day match his dedication to the club. </p></li>
<li><p>That said, <a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/news/djb-news-grand-master-report-50">some other guy became GM</a>. You might know him as Mav. He’s okay, I guess. He really does need to make his Character Sheet, though. Please make sure to nag him about it. Not like he was one of the primary architects that created the current iterations of the CS’s and ACC...</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/news/djb-news-a-new-dgm-and-call-for-applications">Vyr was made DGM</a>. This means we need a new Herald. I offered my services, but apparently my <del>genius in art</del> stick figures go underappreciated. There is also an opening for a <a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/news/djb-news-a-new-dgm-and-call-for-applications"> Social Media Tribune.</a> Do the things.</p></li>
<li><p>Atra has released a report in which he debuts our new <a href="https://wiki.darkjedibrotherhood.com/view/ACC_Guide#Armor">Armor System</a>. I won’t steal his thunder, but I just wanted to say that I really dig this system and appreciate all the legwork that went into it. Atra superhero’d a lot of the admin that needed to be done, and it’s not something you’ll ever really see, so I’m calling it out even though he hates the spotlight. Thanks, Atra. </p></li>
<li><p>GJWXII fiction was concluded with the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NK1y5DeOgSiCHXkutI1Uqkjfys5irXEv/view">Chapter 6: Finale</a>. Sarin is still working on a fiction that he wanted to put out to help with the epilogue of that story. It will be out when it’s ready, and in the meantime, please feel free to ask Mav and I questions if you’re curious about what is going on. Thanks for your continued understanding.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="text-center"><img src="https://darkjedibrotherhood.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/assets/assets/000/001/497/original/Wally-sep.png?1475901378" alt="header"/></p>

<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>

<p>In the interest of not boring people with this section, I’m going to share the Google Sheet I’m using to track all relevant Voice Projects. Some of these are things my staff and I are working on, and some are things I’m working with other DCers on. That said, I encourage anyone that applied for Magistrate previously or that is still interested in helping out to reach out to me if they see a project they are interested in, especially in any section where you see “Volunteer work”.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://goo.gl/A4FnWP">Project Tracker</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As an example of some freelance task work, Beef went ahead and created summaries of the different chapters of the <a href="https://wiki.darkjedibrotherhood.com/view/Twelfth_Great_Jedi_War">Great Jedi War XII</a>. Check them out <a href="https://wiki.darkjedibrotherhood.com/view/Twelfth_Great_Jedi_War#Summary">here</a>. Thanks again for the help here, Beef!</p>

<p>Grot also came through big for me with some smaller tasks involving coalescing #AskTheVoice questions into a document for me, rounding up currently running fiction comps that are DB-wide, and some assistance with the Collective Wiki. He also helped — along with Arch, Drae’lath, and Mark — to proof over my shoulder on some of my admin work. I like sharing what I work on with membership, and try to maintain as much transparency as I can. That said, there are certain things that I only discuss or work on with the DC, but I’m always excited for opportunities to share my workflows or process with membership. </p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="https://darkjedibrotherhood.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/assets/assets/000/001/497/original/Wally-sep.png?1475901378" alt="header"/></p>

<h3 id="the-collective-chronicles">The Collective Chronicles</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/factions/the-collective">Collective Faction</a> page has grown thanks to the entries we recieved from the first part of <a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/competitions/13376">The Collective Chronicles</a>. I want to thank all of you for your submissions, but I also want everyone to join me in thanking my staff. Atty and TuQ did the monumental task of converting the entries into NPC sheets. This takes some deft admin work, because not only are there steps that are required in that process administratively through the site, but they also had to work to make sure that members&#39; entries were in line with our approval guidelines in terms of Physical Descriptions and Aspects. If you are curious about something, think something looks off, or have questions, just let me know. </p>

<p>Check out the top 5 NPCs from each sub-competition. </p>

<p>I’ll also be going through and picking out Custom Aspects that I think would work as pre-written ones. Great work to everyone who put the effort in, and I’m really excited with everything that I’ve been seeing. </p>

</ul>

<h4 id="wiki-updates">Wiki Updates</h4>

<p>With the influx of information we’ve gained since its original creation, I’ve gone ahead and split each of the sub-factions into their own respective wiki page. This is very exciting to me, because <a href="https://wiki.darkjedibrotherhood.com/view/The_Collective">The Collective wiki</a> has grown so much since we first introduced them. As a co-creator, this is one of those rare joys I am glad I get to share with the rest of the club. </p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="https://i.gyazo.com/f6633f35f2fcdad782354aba73ecde1c.png" alt="wikishot"/></p>

<p>Expect a follow up newspost to this report with more details on the results of the first four competitions. I will also have the fiction I promised featuring the winning NPCs that were created. I will say that I was so pleased with the turnout of entries, and hope we can continue this same interest and momentum into the next few competitions. </p>

<h4 id="new-competitions">New Competitions!</h4>

<p>For now, we have two more competitions that will help close out the Collective Chronicles. Based on feedback from Fiction Chat, I give you:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/competitions/13376">CC:</a> <a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/competitions/13582">Origin Stories</a> — A fiction competition where you pick one of the new (or old) Collective NPCs and write a story about where they come from and how they join up with The Collective. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/competitions/13376">CC:</a> <a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/competitions/13581">Collective Report</a> — A unique kind of competition where you create a data-like report on the Collective sub-factions. You are tasked with flushing out their culture, organizational structure, history, and other fun world building information that can bolster the Collective Wiki. </li>
</ul>

<p>Let us know if you have any questions!</p>

<h3 id="ask-the-voice">Ask The Voice</h3>

<p>Speaking of questions. I don’t do these very often, but I figured I’d run one while <del>procrastinating</del> waiting on tackling this report. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Laren asks:</strong>  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Considering the sheer scope and magnitude of our current antagonist, the Collective, it is clear that there are numerous avenues for plot development Clans can take. My question is, do you think it would be a good idea to collect all current Clan storylines into a single (online) document accessible to all Consuls and DC members? This would be so that you can provide direct feedback and suggestions, while at the same time allowing other leaders to have a consistent grasp of ongoing, concurrent storylines from other autonomous units.</p></li>
<li><p>Though impartial and directly involved with all things fictionally developed, do you have a favourite part of The Collective over some others? If yes, which and why? Or if not, why?</p></li>
<li><p>Are we going to see any more writing-type specific competitions in the future (ie. the Dialogue series)?</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>1 — We have a <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/brotherhoodfictions">Fiction Archive</a>. Consuls are able to upload their Clan stories there. There is also a <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-vYlrW6IxW6RjM0NG83bE1qb1k">Google Drive</a> folder for it. This is also being discussed at the leadership level to see how we can do this in the future to display and organize this information best.</p>

<p>As Mav and I have explained to the Dark Summit mostly, the DC is responsible for the main storyline and plot of the DB. Clan stories are given a lot of freedom to pursue their unit and sub unit storylines. I don&#39;t want to bog down the Fiction Center wiki page with each Clan&#39;s storylines (it&#39;s too much for any team to really track on) but I&#39;d not be against each Clan organizing their own &quot;Clan Storyline&quot; page that could be linked to with timelines/links to fiction. Just keep in mind that no matter what we do, the majority of members/leaders outside the DC-level don&#39;t read other units&#39; work. I&#39;d like to pretend otherwise, but I&#39;ve been around too long. In terms of feedback, I provide it when asked, usually. I don&#39;t like to micromanage, but am always happy (and have/will continue to communicate this with the Dark Summit) to work with Clan leadership to assist with integrating with the DB&#39;s main plotlines.</p>

<p>2 —  I like the Collective because while it wasn&#39;t my idea, I got to help build it. It&#39;s like being given a brand new house, and then told you have an unlimited credit card and can buy whatever furniture and decor you want to deck it out. It was a lot, though. My hope with the Collective Chronicles and other similar competitions is to continue to give members the opportunity to add to the Collective, because I think this will make them (and future antagonist/rival factions) feel more real and connectable.</p>

<p>3 — If enough people express interest, sure. They&#39;re not hard to grade and run, but I felt like I was pulling teeth/nagging people to submit entries. If there is interest, I&#39;ll run it, though. Sound in the comments if you want to see more dialogue comps!</p>

<p>Great questions, Laren.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Kelly asks:</strong> </p>

<ol>
<li>Is there anything you can share about the direction of the Inq moving forward? </li>
<li>How sad/excited are you about the finale of Rebels? </li>
<li>Do you think we&#39;ll get a Resistance version of Rebels? I heard something about Disney filing for trademarks under Resistance but don&#39;t want to get my hopes up.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>1 — My vision starts with making the Inquisitorius not just the GM&#39;s personal killsquad. That&#39;s what the name implies re: the Empire and SW Rebels, but it&#39;s not how I&#39;ve always envisioned it. I want to refine this by making some updates to the Society to make it function more as the Brotherhood&#39;s intelligence/assassin network. Their focus is on identifying and eliminating threats to the Brotherhood. By being a part of this society, they gain access to unique perks, items, and eventually I want to set up “safehouse” bunkers and shops around the galaxy. To do this, I&#39;ve asked Evant to give us Imperial Listener ships that I’m re-purposing. These ships help create the &quot;Advanced Intelligence Network&quot; that gives us a way to have encrypted transmissions around the galaxy for agents of the Brotherhood. We saw them first on display in the GJW fiction, but expect more info as Evant and I solidify the DC faction and fleet. It will also give us some more use with Arx being the centerpoint of the Brotherhood&#39;s power by storing and backing up all the data there, ala Scarif in Rogue One.</p>

<p>2 — I&#39;m sad it&#39;s coming to an end, but really positive and happy about it. Dave Feloni didn&#39;t get to end TCW on his own terms thanks to the network. It took years to finish it properly with the &quot;unaired&quot; episodes, the final season. It&#39;s some of the best Star Wars world building to date, honestly. I&#39;m upset that he never got to realize the scene he storyboarded and shared at SWC with Bane facing down young Boba in a western duel. </p>

<p>I&#39;m happy that Feloni gets to end the show HE created HIS way. It might not be what fans or everyone wants, but I am glad that in what might be his last really personal work, he gets to finish it how he wants. He&#39;s now moving on to lead the entire animation and storytelling ventures for LSG, so I&#39;m excited with that comes next. </p>

<p>3 —  I don’t think that we will see that. They want to do something different, but will likely try and mirror the things that worked well for Rebels. That said. If Disney <strong>doesn’t</strong> do something with <a href="https://youtu.be/V_bhX7ABpj8?t=116">what they set up and teased in the epilogue</a> (<em>~spoiler~</em>) I <strong>will</strong> become very cross with them. #AhsokaLives</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Turel asks:</strong> How open are you to doing another direct collaboration with unit leaders on a db-wide update like you did with the &quot;seven-strands&quot; update? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As much as that aged me a few years, I&#39;m always open minded to things like that. It&#39;s up to Mav, though, if that is something he wants me to pursue. For anyone that’s curious about this, check out the fiction <a href="https://wiki.darkjedibrotherhood.com/view/Fiction_Updates:_Story_Arcs#Anthology_Part_3:_Seven_Strands">here</a> on the <a href="https://wiki.darkjedibrotherhood.com/view/Fiction_Center">Fiction Center</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Atra asks:</strong> Any experience based tips for membership on how to get over the hurdle and create a top placement worthy fiction? Could be merely organizational tips, finding the perfect song, what have you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually talked about this on the <a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/news/plagcast-episode-iv-a-new-podcast">Plagcast podcast</a> I was on. Off the top of the dome, though: Crafting challenges and obstacles are important. If you roll nat 20&#39;s throughout the entire story, it can become very flat very quickly. The top entries I&#39;ve read or graded have all had a theme of overcoming obstacles or challenges. &quot;My character would never be in that situation, so I can&#39;t do this prompt.&quot; Bad way to go about anything. Some of the better stories, I think, come from: &quot;What IF my character had to deal with X&quot;.</p>

<p>Music is personal. Whatever works for you. Studies show that you are more creative and use more of your brain when music or audio is playing while you work. I prefer instrumental or music that I can tune out. Lyrical-heavy music doesn&#39;t help me write, as I then get distracted very easily. Time management is important. That goes without saying. There is also the stress level of perfectionism that holds a lot of people back, I think. Writer&#39;s block, if you want to call it that. Most of it, in my observations here in the DJB, are related to lack of confidence or fear of judgement by others. Screw that. Open up a doc and start writing. If you win, you win. You lose, you lose. (Don&#39;t get me wrong, I hate losing, but it is what it is and you learn from failure). Just write. If it&#39;s not perfect, you will either fix it later, or it just isn&#39;t what you hoped. It&#39;s better than not doing anything at all, though, imo. Have fun and write.</p>

<p><strong>TuQ asks:</strong>  What are your favourite type of competitions to participate in?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ACC will always be my favorite activity. I have a hard time keeping up with the concept of  Run-On as I’ve gotten older as well. ACC is great because it lets me focus and work on reacting to what another writer feeds me. It allows me to use the Character Sheets and the items I have and really get to test my “build” against another person&#39;s “build”. It’s the reason I originally joined the DB—the promise of the ACC. Ironically, I do not like fiction competitions from a competitive standpoint, and just enjoy writing for fun when I participate in them. I also enjoy multimedia, where I’m able to use my BFA in Film/TV for something remotely useful. </p>

<h4 id="currently-listening-to">Currently Listening to</h4>

<p>So, I’ve never been into D&amp;D or any kind of table top. Like, vocally. Even with all the work I’ve done with the CS system and mechanics in the DJB, I’ve never once played a game of D&amp;D or anything other than video game RPGs. A month or so ago, I did a media-trade with a friend of mine who wanted me to listen to this podcast. It’s called <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/adventure-zone">The Adventure Zone</a>, which is done by the guys that do My Brother, My Brother, and Me over at Maximum Fun. This podcast is about the three brothers playing D&amp;D with their dad for the first time. I’m going to plug it here because 1.) It’s made me actually want to try tabletop gaming 2.) I relate heavily to the DM as he explains in some out of character episodes how he tries to manage the macro storyline while not over-controlling the micro. I really identified with him here, as it’s how I like to look at the DJB storyline, and 3.) because it’s hilarious. Really, really funny and enjoyable even if you’ve never played D&amp;D before. Very good storytelling too. </p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/adventure-zone">The Adventure Zone</a> on your preferred podcast application (I use Google Music). </p>

<p>Quick note:  it is your responsibility to coordinate your matches.  Waiting until the last minute causes unnecessary stress for everyone involved.</p>

<h2 id="heroes-of-the-storm-season-one-round-one">Heroes of the Storm: Season One; Round One</h2>

<p>I was hoping to have this all wrapped up by the end of the day on the 4th, but a few people are having geographical issues. As such, I will be extending this until March 11th and NO LONGER. If you have not completed your matches by then, I will be awarding 3 points to a win and 1 point to a loss and making playoff seeding based on that.</p>

<p>Divisions and Standings can be viewed <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nUWJBDvH78lZ0s515hHx2CNSq3KtTBGcekRbEtdyL-Q/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="jedi-academy-season-one-round-one-knock-out-stage">Jedi Academy: Season One; Round One, Knock-Out Stage</h2>

<p>We have reached the end of the Knock-Out Stage and the finals are set! Blade vs. Jurdan for Round One Glory! Congratulations to the both of them!</p>

<h2 id="overwatch-season-one-round-one">Overwatch: Season One; Round One</h2>

<p>Sign-ups are now OPEN! You can choose if you want to participate in PC, PS4, or both! I will also be testing set schedules during this round. Each match-up you face will have a scheduled time by which your match must be completed, otherwise both players will be given a loss (some exceptions will be made for those who demonstrate a concerted effort to reach their opponent).</p>

<p>I will also be testing geographical divisions, in which you will be matched up in your division against people from the same geographical region as you. Thus avoiding situations where people are twelve hours apart and attempting to get their matches in.</p>

<p>Sign-ups for this can be found <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/PD6W2Hl67O2KPswt2">here</a>.</p>

<p>PC standings can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-kRWgZhuCNhJTDd6pwC1iSXqXtVAeqrMTzgzZXNVRTk/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>

<p>I appreciate all of your patience as we run these events for the Brotherhood. I’m learning as I go here as well; what works and what doesn’t. The biggest issue I’ve run into is making sure that people are getting their matches done on time, so I’m making the biggest effort to make sure that we can organize that a little better and set ourselves up for success in the future. Thank you all for your dedication to making gaming thrive in this club. I’m super excited for the future!</p>

<p>I have the honour to be your obedient servant,</p>

<p>A (dot) Jinn</p>

<h2 id="message-from-the-fist">Message from the Fist</h2>

<p>Hello DB.  I’m back from my first trip to California.  Most people come here for a vacation.  I came here for other <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8-gyaN2Ydc">reasons</a>.  It was a tough month, and it’s good to be home.</p>

<p>Edgar did a great job of holding down the fort while I was gone.  His February report covered a lot of great info, and I appreciate him keeping the trains running on time while I was gone.  I’ve got another training event at the end of this month, so he’ll be back at the helm in April while I’m enjoying another 30 days of fun in the Mojave.  </p>

<p>There’s obviously been a lot going on the past few weeks.  Grand Master Pravus has <a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/news/djb-news-grand-master-report-50">retired</a> for the second time, and Mav <a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/news/reports-grand-master-report-1-the-new-gm-s-quick-hits">has assumed the Iron Throne</a>, with Vyr <a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/news/djb-news-a-new-dgm-and-call-for-applications">taking over as DGM</a>.  Pravus’ tenure as Grand Master was filled with new systems, changes to existing systems, and other great things.  For that, he was awarded his second <a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/news/djb-news-a-second-golden-lightsaber-for-pravus">Golden Lightsaber</a>.  I’m excited to see what Mav has in store for us in the future.</p>

<p>Plenty to cover this month.  Couple of gaming changes, updates to an older platform, another discussion on how games get approved, competitions list, discussion on staff rotation, and a few other goodies.</p>

<p>Let’s do this.</p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="https://darkjedibrotherhood.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/assets/assets/000/001/301/original/drac-sep.png?1475879337" alt="div"/></p>

<h2 id="gaming-updates">Gaming Updates</h2>

<h3 id="diablo-3">Diablo 3</h3>

<p>In order to keep things as fresh as I can with a nearly six year old game, I’m giving some additional incentive for all of you to challenge yourselves as you continue your never-ending grind for gear.</p>

<p>Effective immediately, a new Hardcore modifier is available for those who choose to run a HC character.  Hardcore now nets a x2 modifier for normal and greater rifts, so if you’ve ever wanted to really challenge yourself, now is the time to do it!</p>

<h3 id="starcraft-2">StarCraft 2</h3>

<p>Just a reminder, as I mentioned in Fist Supplemental 16.6, there are no longer difficulty modifiers for the PvE cooperative missions.  There was simply no way to prove what difficulty everyone was playing on, so I had no choice but to remove those modifiers.</p>

<h2 id="pobs-for-hearthstone">PoBs for Hearthstone</h2>

<p>Hearthstone is still running strong as our replacement for Pazaak.  Since launch, there have been 85 submissions via the Fist Bot.  That does not take into account the number of matches per submission, but most of you are playing between 3 and 12.  </p>

<p>Because of its popularity and completely free nature, I have decided to add Pendants of Blood for Hearthstone.   Here’s how it works:</p>

<ul>
<li>You get one pendant of blood for each character you level to 25.<br/></li>
<li>There are a maximum of six pendants of blood available for this platform.  You can choose which six characters you submit for, but once you earn six pendants, that’s it.<br/></li>
<li>You must provide a screenshot showing the character and level</li>
<li>You must put which character you are submitting for in the submission.<br/></li>

<h3 id="titanfall-2-removal">Titanfall 2 Removal</h3>

<p>With only a single submission over the past two weeks, I have made the decision to remove Titanfall 2 from our library of supported games.  From this point forward, no clusters of fire or pendants of blood are available for playing this game.</p>

<p>In the event that Titanfall 2 becomes active among DJB gamers again, I will review the activity and make a recommendation to the GM and DGM on returning it to active status.</p>

<h2 id="staff-rotation">Staff Rotation</h2>

<p>Prior to GJW XII, I made the decision to stop rotating my staff positions.  I did this to provide some stability during the GJW and the two long field exercises I was going to be at.  With those almost complete, I am going to re-institute the rotation of my staff positions.  All positions will open up at some point from June to August, so keep an eye out.  Here’s how the position rotation will work:</p>

<p>Praetor: P:FIST will be a one year (max) gig that will open up on 1 June.  The person selected for Praetor will be in charge of managing the magistrates, specifically on DJB-Wide gaming competition creation, and processing of gaming submissions.  Additionally, I will expect the praetor to write a monthly report discussing game updates, sales, and other general gaming knowledge.  Edgar, the current Praetor has done some outstanding work over the past year.  The person who takes over will have some big shoes to fill.</p>

<p>Magistrates:  These are six month positions.  I have three magistrates.  Donny and Juna will rotate out sometime between June and September, staggered so I don’t have two brand new staff positions open at once.   Alaris is only two months into his term, so he will stay for a bit longer.  Magistrates do the day to day work in the office.  They process gaming submissions in less than 24 hours, run DB-Wide gaming competitions, and review and edit wiki pages where needed.   </p>

<p>I hope that all of you take a chance to apply when these positions open up.  This is a great opportunity to work on a DC staff and learn how it functions.</p>

<h2 id="admin-and-policy-reminders">Admin and Policy Reminders</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Gifs, stickers, images, charity solicitations, and being a jerk are all banned from DB Gaming.  The Gif, Sticker, and image ban is non-negotiable.  I stated in this <a href="https://www.darkjedibrotherhood.com/news/reports-fist-supplemental-10-1-competitions-and-db-gaming-rules">news post</a> what the rules of engagement were.  I have now made it relatively simple:  Only admins can post images.  If you have something you think should be posted, ask me or a member of my staff.</p></li>
<li><p>The staff has 24 hours from the time you submit gaming activity to approve it.  If your submission has been sitting for longer than that, there is a problem.  If it hasn’t, there is no problem.  The staff do their best to process gaming submissions as quickly as possible, but they are real people with real lives.  I do not expect them to sit behind a computer processing gaming submissions all day, and neither should any of you.</p></li>
<li><p>Solo submissions are never acceptable for Clusters of Earth/Fire.  My staff and I will reject any that come in.  You must play with at least one other DB member, no exceptions.  This is not changing any time in the near (or far) future.</p></li>
<li><p>Pendants of Blood are not acceptable for submission to cluster-counting competitions.  If we see them, we will remand the request.</p></li>
<li><p>Reminder:  Feel free to run Gaming competitions DB wide.  Gaming is a slightly different community, and is one of the few that consistently brings club members together outside of the competitive environment.  Most of the people I currently game are all in different clans.  By opening up your event DB-wide, you increase the pool of possible participants, which could allow for a crescent upgrade!</p></li>
<li><p>Reminder:  While I sincerely appreciate having proposals/great ideas sent to me via telegram, please email the staff list (email is at the bottom of this report).  I ask that your House and Clan leadership take a look at your proposals before you send them up.  This isn’t to add a layer of bureaucracy, it’s because I’m sure they’d like to know how you are trying to help the club improve...helps with award and promotion recommendations and all that.  Feel free to cc them on your email to me and my staff.</p></li>

<p>TL;DR</p>

<ol>
<li>I am home.  But I will leave again.</li>
<li>Buff for D3, PoBs for HS, Removal of TF2</li>
<li>Competitions galore</li>
<li>Staff Rotation coming back</li>
</ol>

<p class="text-center"><img src="https://darkjedibrotherhood.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/assets/assets/000/001/301/original/drac-sep.png?1475879337" alt="div"/></p>

<p>It’s great to be home, even though I’ll be heading back out again in about three weeks.  Moving to Hawaii is on the back end of all this training, so I do have that to look forward to.  In other news:</p>

<p>I did buy Monster Hunter World.  </p>

<p>Yes, I like it.</p>

<p>It still won’t work with the DB’s gaming system.  So no matter how many times you beg, it’s probably not getting supported.</p>

<p>But...it is fun.</p>

<p>Anyhoo, until next month, keep on gaming!</p>

<p>-Dracpool, out.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Hello all! </p>

<p>Welcome to my first report as Deputy Grand Master. I’ll keep it short and sweet with tl:dr worthy text, but first I’d like to thank Mav for his vote of confidence, as well as Pravus for his years of service as GM. </p>

<p>Now that the pleasantries are out of the way, onto the topics at hand.</p>

<h1 id="incoming-projects-development-and-ideas">Incoming! Projects, development and ideas</h1>

<p>I’d like to talk a bit about short-term and long-term plans at the moment, or at least the ones I’ve nailed down with Mav that are noteworthy</p>

<hr/>

<h1 id="gjw-award-skins">GJW Award skins</h1>

<p>To me, personally, the elephant in the room.</p>

<p>I’d like to give COU, Arcona and CSP some much needed info on the development of these because I feel I owe you guys a bit of an explanation. </p>

<p>These are being worked on at the moment and are my priority next to the Society stuff. The weapons have been completed, I’m just working on the robes to get them done by next week. I apologize to anyone who was hyped about the quick release of GJW skins, however projects and bad luck seemed to pile after the War and it still hasn’t subsided.</p>

<p>Still, expect an update and release of the skins some time next week. #scoutshonor</p>

<hr/>

<h1 id="shroud-graphics-society-and-gmrg-graphics-update">Shroud (Graphics) Society and GMRG graphics update</h1>

<p>Everyone knows the Graphics Society is coming. Well so is an update to the GMRG. The Herald staff has been hard at work drawing new skins for the GMRG that will bring the it in line with the other Societies. This move was not without forethought and it wasn’t “just about pretty pictures”. New Possessions updates necessitated a change to the way GMRG is handled as far as reward skins per rank. </p>

<p>The new renk Skins will include, among others, the Praetorian armor and the new weapons from last jedi. More on these as they are developed and, likely, when they are released mid-March.</p>

<p>The Shroud Society has become, for lack of better words, my rock that I push up the hill like Sisyphus — as soon as I came close to its release, it was pushed further away. One step forward, two back.</p>

<p>However, finally, it’s being released. It was my dream project since I became Herald almost three years ago and many people have helped and worked on it — Rian, Slagar, Landon, Zehsaa, Jasper, Ozosi, Arcia (Esca) and many more. I thank them all, especially Esca, for helping me make it a reality.</p>

<p>Still, there’s more work to be done so until we get it all sorted and released, I’m not breathing that sigh of relief. Stay tuned for more info soon.</p>

<hr/>

<h1 id="fictional-direction-post-war-and-clan-reintegration-with-the-dc">Fictional direction post-War and Clan reintegration with the DC</h1>

<p>A very big topic I’ll be working on in collaboration with the Voice and GM is the fictional direction for the DB in the future. Certainly, as Mav stated before, the Collective will remain the main antagonist and we’ll continue to develop that further. It’s here to stay, so we’ll have to work around that premise and develop a sensible story that members can engage and enjoy.</p>

<p>With the new GM a new era comes and, hopefully, we can move away from the rebellion plot and onto new pastures. The past three years were harsh as far as fiction is concerned and sparked many controversies due to the necessary changes because of OOC events. What we are looking for is a more stable, united front with the DC and all Clans against external threats (with inter-Clan intrigue and conflicts, as always). </p>

<p>That said we’ll be discussing ideas for the transitional period with all Consuls to make the transition have the most sense. For anyone that’s worried we’ll exclude certain orders or ignore them, we won’t. We’re looking to strike a balance that all order archetypes can relate to (if not all characters personally). For now I only have vague info like this to share, but I wanted to put this out so folks know it’s being worked on. If anyone has questions or ideas you can find me on TG or mail. Feel free to contact me.</p>

<hr/>

<h1 id="ask-the-dgm-1">Ask the DGM #1</h1>

<h4 id="beardhulk-asks-askvyr-hows-the-chair-in-the-dgms-office">Beardhulk asks: #AskVyr How&#39;s the chair in the DGM&#39;s office?</h4>

<p>I made a new one. It’s like mink fur.</p>

<h4 id="turel-asks-askvyr-if-you-could-pick-one-thing-from-your-tenure-on-the-dark-council-youd-go-back-and-do-differently-what-would-it-be-and-why">Turel asks: #askVyr If you could pick one thing from your tenure on the Dark Council you&#39;d go back and do differently what would it be and why?</h4>

<p>Honestly I don’t think I would change anything. Despite hiccups along the way, I probably wouldn’t be where I am without my decisions as Herald. </p>

<h4 id="korras-asks-askvyr-what-do-you-plan-to-achieve-first">Korras asks: #askvyr what do you plan to achieve first?</h4>

<p>Shroud Society and GMRG update, honestly.</p>

<h4 id="arch-askvyr-weve-heard-a-good-deal-about-mavs-plans-and-ideas-do-you-have-any-focuses-or-pet-projects-we-havent-heard-about-yet">Arch: #AskVyr We&#39;ve heard a good deal about Mav&#39;s plans and ideas. Do you have any focuses or pet projects we haven&#39;t heard about yet?</h4>

<p>Not really, no. I’m sure more will come up as I carry on but at the moment, no. Stay tuned.</p>

<h4 id="mark-asks-askvyr-so-with-your-elevation-to-the-dgm-spot-as-morgan-will-we-be-seeing-vyr-author-s-note-vorsa-in-an-antagonistic-role">Mark asks: #AskVyr So with your elevation to the DGM spot as Morgan, will we be seeing Vyr (author’s note: *Vorsa) in an antagonistic role?</h4>

<p>That depends on how much time I invest into personal fiction. So far it hasn&#39;t been much, so I’m not seeing how that will change much. We’ll see, though. She may yet become a key player, if anything for COU.</p>

<h4 id="dek-asks-askvyr-1-any-chance-vyr-author-s-note-vorsa-will-make-a-comeback-2-the-dgm-position-hasnt-always-been-or-seemed-clearly-defined-with-that-said-what-do-you-think-of-your-own-position-and-what-would-you-like-to-bring-to-it">Dek asks:  #askvyr 1. Any chance Vyr (author’s note: *Vorsa) will make a comeback? 2. The DGM position hasn&#39;t always been or seemed clearly defined.  With that said, what do you think of your own position and what would you like to bring to it?</h4>

<ol>
<li>Morgan will hold the position, if that was your question. Otherwise, see above. 2. It’s like that for a reason. DC members are chosen for specific skills, however the DGM has to be a jack of all trades despite their strengths and weaknesses. Basically i will fill in any role Mav doesn’t feel comfortable doing. DGMs are chosen to compliment their GMs for the most part, at least it’s like that in this case.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="len-asks-askvyr-what-are-you-and-mav-looking-for-in-a-herald-application">Len asks: #AskVyr what are you and Mav looking for in a Herald application?</h4>

<p>Mav answered this in his address to the members. Me personally? They’ll have to step up what we’ve done so far. There has to be clear progress. There’s no easy mode for the Herald.</p>

<h4 id="atty-asks-askvyr-whats-next-for-morgan-fictionally-whats-she-thinking-as-she-leaves-the-matron-for-dgm-whats-her-goal">Atty asks: #AskVyr what&#39;s next for Morgan fictionally? What&#39;s she thinking as she leaves the matron for DGM? What&#39;s her goal?</h4>

<p>At first? “I’m dead.” because I don’t think she’d be told via holocall so she’d have to face Telaris for the announcement. After that? Relief she’s still alive and worry as to what to do now. Also, maybe a renewed faith in her original mission as Herald? I dunno, we’ll see.</p>

<h4 id="viv-asks-askvyr-you-are-put-in-charge-of-disney-for-long-enough-to-make-one-change-or-approve-one-star-wars-related-project-what-do-you-do">Viv asks: #AskVyr you are put in charge of Disney for long enough to make one change or approve one Star Wars related project. What do you do?</h4>

<p>Give the Star wars licence to CDPR</p>

<h4 id="esca-asks-askvyr-cree-forgot-some-things-on-the-matron-can-that-just-be-shoved-into-a-storage-closet-somewhere-or-is-morgan-gonna-take-care-of-it-for-her">Esca asks: #AskVyr - C&#39;ree forgot some things on the Matron. Can that just be shoved into a storage closet somewhere, or is Morgan gonna take care of it for her?</h4>

<p>They’re displayed in Morgan’s quarters, most likely, and taken care of.</p>

<h4 id="sariel-asks-askvyr-how-will-you-work-with-members-and-leaders-alike-to-ensure-things-like-a-clan-closing-don-t-happen-what-in-your-mind-needs-to-be-fixed-within-the-club-to-see-new-clans-open-how-do-you-intend-to-fix-what-needs-to-be-fixed">Sariel asks: #AskVyr how will you work with members and leaders alike to ensure things like a Clan closing don’t happen? What, in your mind, needs to be fixed within the club to see new Clans open? How do you intend to fix what needs to be fixed?</h4>

<p>For one, there needs to be a willingness from leaders and members alike to engage with the content the DB provides, but it’s mostly up to the leaders to present that content. It’s on a case to case basis for each Clan, mostly because Clan cultures are so diverse, so i don’t have a clear answer for you. As things come along, I’ll engage in constructive discussions with Clan leaders. For the second part, well it’s pretty obvious we need more members. Hopefully the social media tribune spot gives us some much needed exposure. Again, it’s one of those “we’ll have to think on it and come up with solutions” because there’s no one thing that can fix these issues and they&#39;re connected in a complex weave. It’s something we’ll have to struggle with a lot and we intend to.</p>

<h4 id="sariel-asks-again-askvyr-will-new-traditions-orders-and-paths-be-opening-up">Sariel asks again: #AskVyr will new traditions, orders, and paths be opening up?</h4>

<p>We haven’t really talked about it yet. Stay tuned.</p>

<h4 id="blade-asks-askvyr-how-do-you-plan-to-make-dgm-special-to-you-put-another-way-vyrs-flavor-of-dgm">Blade asks: #AskVyr How do you plan to make DGM special to you, put another way Vyr&#39;s flavor of DGM?</h4>

<p>We’ll see eventually. Thus far I have no plans and I’m not thinking about it. My plan is to work on the DB, whether that effect is positive only time will tell.</p>

<h4 id="greetings-all">Greetings all,</h4>

<p>Several major announcements today, including our new Deputy Grand Master and two positions open for application.  </p>

<h4 id="morgan-b-sorenn-aka-vyr-has-been-appointed-deputy-grand-master">Morgan B. Sorenn, aka V&#39;yr, has been appointed Deputy Grand Master!</h4>

<p>It is my great honor today to name our new Deputy Grand Master, Morgan B. Sorenn, aka V&#39;yr.  During his time on the Dark Council, V&#39;yr has worked tirelessly to deliver the best content he can to our members.  He has transformed graphics in the Brotherhood from a specialty of a minority of members to a vibrant artistic community.  At no point were the fruits of his labor more obvious than in the last Great Jedi War, when I had a chance to grade graphics entries.  The quantity of quality entries was astounding, with many entries from members I had no idea had such impressive talents.  V&#39;yr has been more than that as Herald, though, as he helped us regear our Great Jedi War story on short notice and develop the Factions system and the Collective.  He has been a consistent source of ideas and a positive influence on the Council, and I&#39;m excited to have him by my side as DGM. V&#39;yr has a few more graphics related projects to finish - notably the launch of our Graphics Society, which he will finish as DGM - but he and I will soon be working together to bring the same enthusiasm he brought to Brotherhood graphics to every aspect of our club.  </p>

<h4 id="herald-open-for-applications">Herald open for Applications</h4>

<p>With Vyr&#39;s appointment to Deputy Grand Master, we will be opening applications to the Brotherhood for a new Herald.  We are looking for a talented leader and artist capable of managing a staff of artists to fulfill the Brotherhood&#39;s graphics needs while simultaneously working as a collaborative team member on the Dark Council.  We should note that we are not only looking for the most talented artist here - while skill level is important, ability to manage a team and work as team member on the Dark Council are paramount. Interested members should first familiarize themselves with the <a href="https://wiki.darkjedibrotherhood.com/view/Herald">requirements of the office</a>.  Applications should include relevant Brotherhood experience, describe short and long term project plans for the Herald office, discuss any ideas to continue developing our art community, and link to a Google Driver folder of a portfolio including 5 to 10 of the member&#39;s best works of art.  Please apply by email to the new DGM and myself.  We will be looking to fill this position no later than <strong>March 14th</strong>, and may fill the position earlier than that based on applicant pool.  </p>

<h4 id="social-media-tribune">Social Media Tribune</h4>

<p>Today I am also opening applications for what we are calling Social Media Tribune.  As this will effectively be a new position, I will provide quite a bit of detail for what we are after.  Put simply, this position will organize our social media strategy and work with the Dark Council to increase the Brotherhood&#39;s footprint on social media.  Although &#39;Recruitment Tribune&#39; has functioned this way in the past, the sphere of this position is not primarily aimed at recruitment directly; the Dark Council is currently discussing whether to focus a Tribune position on recruitment itself, or instead to charge an existing DC office with club-wide efforts towards recruitment.  We will provide more details on that soon, but for now, more details on Social Media Tribune!  </p>

<p>Although the Star Chamber will maintain ownership over our social media accounts, Social Media Tribune will propose and implement a strategy to increase traffic to the Brotherhood website through the use of social media and other applicable strategies.  This individual is expected to directly update social media streams based on a proposal they outline, may hire a small team, and will work with other individuals in positions, both in Clans and on the Dark Council, to promote Brotherhood social media accounts internally as well as externally.  Moreover, the individual should aim to establish a sustainable system that does not require a single person or specific persons to succeed such that any improvement in social media presence will not immediately crumble should he or she have to step down. </p>

<p>Interested members should submit full applications to the Grand Master, the new Deputy Grand Master, and the Sensechal.  Applicants should detail all relevant experience to the position (including any real life experience), as well as detail a proposal regarding how the applicant will improve the DB social media presence in the short and long term, how they intend to validate that their strategies are working, and how they will build a sustainable social media presence for the future.  We are open to broad proposals on how to utilize social media to build the Brotherhood&#39;s presence, and we are open to modest proposals that may require some adjustment to the content on the front page (significant reworks of the website are off the table right now - if you aren&#39;t sure, talk to Mav/James).  There is no rank requirement, but a track-record that demonstrates an individual&#39;s reliability and ability to work with a diverse DB team is a requirement.  Experience with social media is a requirement, and bonus points go to individuals that have managed social media accounts for organizations in the past at some level.  Applications formally close on <strong>March 14th</strong>, but we may make a decision before then.</p>

<p>With that, please congratulate V&#39;yr on his appointment to Deputy Grand Master, and get your applications for HRLD and T:Social Media started!  </p>
