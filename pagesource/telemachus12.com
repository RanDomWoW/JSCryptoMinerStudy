<p>Anonymous male erotica artist, Herodotus, is kind of like the Banksy of gay porn. Nobody knows his true identity or when he&rsquo;ll strike next, but the Internet is littered with his Photoshop art. The self-described &ldquo;Master of Manipulation&rdquo; takes real images already made famous in the gay porn world and re-imagines them with a superhero twist.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a comic book nerd with an appreciation for gay porn, it really doesn&rsquo;t get any better than this. Herodotus can take your favorite stars and put them in places and situations you&rsquo;ve always wanted to see. No fantasy is too specific once you&rsquo;ve seen an Ancient Egyptian god fuck a white slave. Why didn&rsquo;t we learn history like this in school?</p>
<p style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;">Telemachus adds: As far as I can tell, all those pix 'littered' across the net were 'lovingly' ripped off from this website, hey-ho. Congrats (H)</p>

<p>"The Art of Telemachus" is a great example of 3D possibilities, mixed with an avid, sexy imagination. The author, the London-based Dave, has developed an interesting style, replete, of course, with images from ancient Greek characters, among others. Naturally, I suspect he has some images of people he knows as well - friends or maybe acquaintances who stir his vivid imagination. We get a number of more modern, fantastical images as well - a Space Soldier, military men and we also get many scenes involving some sexy acts of intimate gay male behavior. It is all very naughty and somehow more erotic for its cartoon nature. These images are close to perfect, like many 3D artists, but Dave uses a level of supple sexuality which courses through and makes this unique to his personal style. His blog is terrific in displaying links and galleries of other like-minded artists, plying their skills in the 3D format also. It is a rich blog, full of well-written stories, wonderfully erotic galleries and some personal appeals for more interaction with those who like his blog. Very up-front, this blog is a nice place to travel and spend some Eye Candy time</p>

<p>Most Poser art is all about fantasy, but ... well, did you ever have one of those nights out when you drank too much and passed out on a pool table in a bar somewhere with nothing on but your socks? Or maybe that time when you were enjoying a quiet stroll down an alley while on shore leave when all of a sudden you were attacked by two hot skinhead punks? Or all those nights when you had your sleep interrupted by an incubus in your bedroom? Telemachus captures those little slices of life perfectly: it's not art, it's <span style="font-style:italic;">documentary</span>
