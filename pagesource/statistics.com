And the textbooks are marvelous in their clarity of expression and real world examples. I have told many of my colleagues about this wonderful and refreshing online medium for learning about statistics.</p><h6>-- Herbert Turner, Analytica, Inc.</h6></li><li><p>Over the last two summers, I've taken the two stats courses meant to prepare future AP Stats teachers. Those courses were invaluable to me and gave me the confidence I needed to tackle a difficult subject.</p><h6>-- Karen Behrend, Analytica, Inc.</h6></li><li><p>I would like to thank you for offering such a chance for people to extend their knowledge in the fields of statistics, and consequently provide them the adequate tools for better performance and sound achievements in their jobs and research.</p><h6>-- Laila Shaar, Analytica, Inc.</h6></li><li><p>As a SAS programmer, I believe I will continue to use SAS for data manipulation but will utilize R when running models and exploring large data sets.</p><h6>-- Julie Kezik, Yale University</h6></li><li><p>I took the course to get starting using R, thus I think this will help with my use of statistics in the future.   I really think these online courses are great.</p><h6>-- Pernille Koefoed, University of Copehagen</h6></li><li><p>I need to know R to perform my job as I am a product manager for a software company that interacts with R.  I am now able to understand R scripts and hopefully contribute some of my own. The instructor's videos were great. Just hearing his voice made it more personal. This was my first ever web based course and I really enjoyed it although I had to work hard.</p><h6>-- Ana Henry, Certara</h6></li><li><p>I will be using this knowledge in my daily work.  Thank you.  It was really interesting and useful.</p><h6>-- Vladislav Klyashtorny, ZAO Generium</h6></li><li><p>This was one of the best statistics.com courses I've taken.  I'm basing this comment on the online active text and video components - very clear!</p><h6>-- Silvia Bartolic, The University of British Columbia</h6></li><li><p>Excellent course!  Great support from Professor and Teaching Assistant!  Loved every single thing about this course and its content.</p><h6>-- Chafik Abdellaoui, Coca-Cola</h6></li><li><p>My organization is slowly embracing predictive analytics outside of our environmental concerns, so this course contributes directly to strengthening my R toolkit!</p><h6>-- Jonathan Jenkins, Coca-Cola</h6></li><li><p>More and more medical students are submitting systematic reviews and associated meta-analyses, to meet research exposure requirements, in the Basic Sciences Programs of their medical school education, here in the Caribbean. The course provided me with a unique and much appreciated opportunity to learn much more about the technique, its underlying principles, and how to correctly apply the tool whenever evaluating a collection of primary studies. Time and energies committed to the course have been very well spent.</p><h6>-- William Keller, Coca-Cola</h6></li><li><p>After trying to learn meta-analysis from various texts (e.g., Hunter et al., 2004; Cooper et al., 2009 and others), I found the Borenstein text and CMA software to be *extremely* user-friendly.  It made the selection of fixed-effect or random-effects models much easier to understand, and the presentation of the math was very straightforward.  If I could write a book, I would want to do it this way.  Each chapter was short and to the point.  Not a lot of extras, but a sufficient number of worked examples to make it work.  The software is very easy to use, and I appreciate the continual improvement that seems to be made.  You and your colleagues have done something incredible here.</p><h6>-- Chad Briggs, Coca-Cola</h6></li><li><p>It will help me gain confidence with conducting data analysis using R.  I have tried a few R MOOCs in the past which helped me start out using R but I had not found a comprehensive intro to R that I could use more broadly - this course really succeeds with accomplishing that.</p><h6>-- Dalia Estrada-Pintel, Coca-Cola</h6></li><li><p>This course has given me a much better understanding of biostatistics and will allow me to gain more from my campus based studies.</p><h6>-- Leighton Anderson, Coca-Cola</h6></li><li><p>This course supplied a solid foundation for identifying statistical outliers in demand patterns for business planning purposes.  In addition, it has deepened my understanding of statistical safety stock calculations &amp; inventory level decision making.</p><h6>-- James Migliano, Acme Manufacturing Company, Inc.</h6></li><li><p>I much enjoyed your text mining course last year and plan to take the deep learning one - thanks for creating it</p><h6>-- Milan Hejtmanek, Seoul National University</h6></li><li><p>I really appreciate what you're doing.  You've got a very satisfied customer!</p><h6>-- Luiz Grossman, Optionline</h6></li><li><p>This course fundamentally deepened my understanding of statistics and studies. I will certainly apply the knowledge gained as often as possible.  Absolutely vital course for understanding basic epidemiology, studies and statistics. THANK YOU. I would recommend that everyone get a copy of the textbook before class though. It complements the ActivEpi CD extremely well.</p><h6>-- Timothy Berlyn, Holland America Group</h6></li><li><p>This course will greatly contribute to my work as an environmental data scientist and division director.  This course was a great introduction of how to use R to fit the models and how to interpret the R output!</p><h6>-- Jonathan Jenkins, Holland America Group</h6></li><li><p>Great explanations provided by the course instructor in the videos and on the discussion board.  The Assistant Teacher was very diligent and professional in reaching out to me and giving me every opportunity to be successful in this course!  Definitely a wonderful experience!!!</p><h6>-- Jonathan Jenkins, Holland America Group</h6></li><li><p>Using information gleaned from the course concerning a not-well-known distance measure (Gower dissimilarity) useful for cluster models that combine data from mixed variables, including nominal, ordinal, and numeric variables, I was able to refine a model I was working on for an academic conference paper.  More broadly, the subject of identifying anomalies is a central task of academic historians, and this course allowed me the welcome luxury to reflect on their nature and methods of discovery.</p><h6>-- Milan Hejtmanek, Seoul National University</h6></li><li><p>I am now confident that I can use R and continue learning on my own.  The course also helped me to explore other resources within the R community online.  I'm looking forward to using R in data analysis for my masters thesis and beyond.</p><h6>-- Brooke Eastman, West Virginia University</h6></li><li><p>The two instructors are to be congratulated in putting together a jewel of a short course, one of my very favorite among the many I have taken at Statistics.com.  The discussion with such experts was particularly valuable and greatly enhanced the value of the course.  If there were an extension to this course, I would gladly take it.</p><h6>-- Milan Hejtmanek, Seoul National University</h6></li><li><p>I felt this class did a good job of reinforcing concepts and their application, and not getting caught up in the algorithms.  The TA feedback was invaluable to me. Thank you!</p><h6>-- Thomas Higgins, National Science Foundation</h6></li><li><p>There are many things I like about your educational product.  You include variety, such as the videos, the homework, the quizzes, the textbook, and the discussion board.  You have well-thought out curriculum that shows a respect for good pedagogy.  Your instructors are amazing!  They are brilliant, and they respond very quickly!  You apply real-world needs to the material being taught instead of having students memorize formulas or be confined within an academic-only practice of modeling.</p><h6>-- Jennifer Oesch, National Science Foundation</h6></li><li><p>I realized that I deal with statistics every day. We covered issues that pertain to real life and I now feel I have knowledge about important issues I was previously unaware about.</p><h6>-- Amelia Feuer, National Science Foundation</h6></li><li><p>Overall, the instructor and the assistant instructors were responsive and helpful.

SQL alone, which I had zero prior experience, is needed for almost every data analytics job I see. R is also ubiquitous and very imporatant. Great to learn how to use both together.</p><h6>-- Gregory Gazurian, Seoul National University</h6></li><li><p>I am very thankful to the course and assistant teachers. I can only add that the course worth its effort and tuition.</p><h6>-- Marina Espinasse, Nord University</h6></li><li><p>Absolutely awesome experience.

He is an awesome professor. He explained each and every doubts we had to the perfection.</p><h6>-- Vinuth Tulasi, Juniper Networks</h6></li><li><p>I feel this class gave me a much better understanding of how to design experiments and enhanced my statistical vocabulary. One thing I liked about Mr. Babinec's approach was that his written explanations were precise. Once I read and comprehended them, they really helped break down what I was reading in the text that was more understandable, especially by comparing/contrasting terms. Overall, I enjoyed the class and it was well worth the time spent.</p><h6>-- Bryan LeRette, Senior Market Research Analyst - Strategy & Planning, Mosaic Life Care</h6></li><li><p>Instructor John Verzani provided timely and detailed responses to each and every question posted on the forum. His depth of knowledge in both statistics and R and his passion for teaching are the major contribution to the success of this class!</p><h6>-- Ming Zhang, Senior Statistical Analyst, Northwestern Medicine</h6></li><li><p>I took this class out of general curiosity and the fact that it used Python, which is increasingly attractive to me in building my own software tools.  To my delighted surprise I found the course to be one of the very best (out of more than 20) I have taken at Statistics.com.  It proved a harmonious blend of theory (buttressed by relevant reading and videos by the instructor), focused homework exercises, and training in Python coding.  As a result I learned much and enjoyed the process greatly.  I was particularly impressed with the instructor's choice of homework assignments, which fascinated me, and with the importance he placed in students writing clear, even elegant, Python code.  This is my fifth course using Python at Statistics.com and while I found the other courses quite useful to varying degrees, I never before had an instructor who spent time advising me on the fine details of my actual coding style and suggesting useful improvements.  Allan Leis is a seasoned professional, working in the field, and it was a luxury having him cast an experienced gaze on my rudimentary code.  It's the kind of thing that would never happen in a MOOC and shows the value of a course such as this.</p><h6>--  Milan Hejtmanek,  Seoul National University</h6></li><li><p>This course has been a life/work changer for me. Within 2 weeks of taking this class, I was able to produce far more informative plots than I ever had before. I'm inspired to take more classes and learn as much as I can about this wonderful new world. Regarding Statistics.com in general - based on my experience with this course that is, this is a class act online program. A friend recommended it several years ago, but I opted for free MOOCs instead, which haven't worked for me. The small size of the classes, the attention by the instructor, and the assignments bode well for learning. All in all - a great course!</p><h6>-- Susan Kamp, Senior Scientist at SM Stoller (U.S. Department of Energy)</h6></li><li><p>It was perfect, much recommended to anybody wanting to understand the dynamics behind political microtargeting and how it can be applied to business. Many theoretical aspects that were known in the past have been empirically implemented with wonderful exercises of Mr. Ken Strasma.</p><h6>-- Karolis Urbonas, Amazon</h6></li><li><p>I have never had an online class before, and I have typically heard bad things about them, so I was shocked when I found out just how easy this course was to manuever. I really liked the format - it allowed me to work at my own pace yet still check in with the teacher and the other students. A really great experience for my first online course.</p><h6>-- Kristin Powers, Amazon</h6></li><li><p>Both the instructor and the teaching assistant were approachable, helpful, and knowledgeable about the subject matter, and provided constructive feedback about discussion board posts and assignment submissions.  The textbook will be a valuable resource for future projects.</p><h6>-- Dennis Fuster, Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals</h6></li><li><p>Very good instructor!!!!!

I enjoy very much learning about simulations and using Cristal ball software. Also this course has given me valuable information about how to approach a risk analysis, and the software model assistant is very interesting</p><h6>-- Juan Gonzalez, King's College London</h6></li><li><p>I found it challenging but also a rewarding experience. After completing this course I am now more confident about undertaking statistical analysis.</p><h6>-- Michael Jonita, Hunter Research Foundation</h6></li><li><p>It helps me help others analyze their data. Thanks - well worth the money!</p><h6>-- Dan Laird, US Air Force</h6></li><li><p>Since I started the Epidemiology Statistics class, I've had a much better understanding of the other staffs' concerns.</p><h6>-- Christian St. Clair, MedStar Health Research Institute</h6></li><li><p>A very nice introduction to the subject. As someone without any real background in epidemiology, now moving into an area where I need it, this course was very helpful indeed.</p><h6>-- Rhondda Jones, James Cook University</h6></li><li><p>This course is a great review of some popular probability distributions and how to test their assumptions. Reviewing the sampling techniques and testing the assumed distributions will help me when I check data and perform regression models.</p><h6>-- Lu Li, Towers Watson</h6></li><li><p>I appreciated the discussion board feedback as well as comments back on the homework assignments. Both of those things have helped me become a more efficient programmer</p><h6>-- Michelle Palmer,  Employees Retirement System of Texas</h6></li><li><p>Dr. Pruim was an outstanding instructor, extremely knowledgeable, respectful and prompt.  This course has given me a strong foundation for continued learning</p><h6>-- Peter Blenis, University of Alberta</h6></li><li><p>This is really a fantastic course.

There is a lot to learn, but it's concentrated on the key points.  For somebody working full time it beats a semester-long course.</p><h6>-- Myriam Abramson, Computer Scientist, Naval Research Laboratory</h6></li><li><p>The course has helped me understand how survival curves and hazard ratios are obtained.</p><h6>-- Dima Abdallah, University College Dublin</h6></li><li><p>Great pace to the course, nice and concise within 3 weeks, enjoyed the discussions, HW was not too intense and time consuming</p><h6>-- Andrew Peterson, University College Dublin</h6></li><li><p>It will help me to better understand the methods behind statistical analysis used for conducting research and publishing data. I enjoyed the course. It's really convenient to do assignments on my own time.</p><h6>-- Matthew Guymon, University College Dublin</h6></li><li><p>As always, professor Everson always provides nice feedback and suggestions to help understand the concepts very well.

It was a terrific course</p><h6>-- Peter Mulready, System Architect at Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceutical</h6></li><li><p>The theory was clear and well explained; which allowed me to tackle very unfamiliar concepts with relative ease. I feel I now have a really firm foundation on which to build and have been encouraged by this course to keep learning and working towards going even deeper into stats and analysis.</p><h6>-- Claire Kentler, La Trobe University</h6></li><li><p>The [instructor] was exceptional at answering unclear issues raised and pointing you to right materials to further help your understanding</p><h6>-- Oluseun Shittu, West London Mental Health NHS Trust</h6></li><li><p>This was a very good course.  Dr. Indrayan has put together a very good on-line learning package.</p><h6>-- Kathy Denesyk, Clinical Pharmacist, London Health Sciences Centre</h6></li><li><p>Gave me some insights in designing experimental studies, analysis of such eg matched case controls studies, and survial analysis. The course was a master piece. I like the style and I will take more courses.</p><h6>-- Richard Chamboko, NOVA Information Management School</h6></li><li><p><p>I really enjoyed this course and found it sufficiently challenging, although well explained and the instructor was very approachable and explained concepts and addressed questions clearly and fairly.  Looking forward to Biostats 2!</p></p><h6>-- Claire Kentler,  La Trobe University</h6></li><li><p>This was a highly interactive course with a first rank expert in his topic who, fortunately, was also good communicator who likes teaching</p><h6>-- John Steward, Welsh Cancer Intelligence & Surveillance Unit</h6></li><li><p>This course is well designed and the course materials are simply awesome! The instructor is very knowledgeable in the field and has tons of examples with codes from his website, which is a huge benefit. The focus on programming and practical tips, as opposed to theoretical details, is also a great benefit.</p><h6>-- Victor Lo, Vice President, Data Science, Fidelity Investments</h6></li><li><p><p>In a nutshell of the 13 Statistics.com courses I have completed to date, this is one of the top three in the intellectual excitement it generated, and the very best taught of all.  Prof. Sen has created a jewel of a class,packing an entire semester's work into 4 weeks, but doing so with such intelligence, panache, and elegance that I enjoyed every minute of the many hours I devoted to it.  His deft blending of video lectures, outside reading, sample programs, and personal feedback on homework was exemplary.  It would have taken me a whole year to learn this material on my own, if I could have done so at all.  I cannot praise this course highly enough</p></p><h6>-- Milan Hejtmanek,  Seoul National University</h6></li><li><p>This course will help me handle statistical analyses and related consultancy in a correct, professional and intelligent way.</p><h6>-- Alfred Keter, Biostatistician, USAID-AMPATH</h6></li><li><p>I came into this course knowing the basics of what Structural Equation Modeling could do. I am leaving this course with a whole new understanding of the ways it can be used to answer many different types of research questions. From psychometrics to multi-level modeling, I now feel like I have a whole new bag of tricks in my tool-belt. While I have read books, being able to go through exercises and get feedback was critical. I do not believe I would have come to such an understanding on my own without this course. It was excellent.</p><h6>-- Brandi Hinnant-Crawford, Western Carolina University</h6></li><li><p>I am only beginning to use SEM. Without the course I would have lacked the understanding and confidence to try and use SEM. I now feel confident that I could apply one of the models and use the results for work purposes and publication.</p><h6>-- Celeste Combrinck, Centre for Evaluation and Assessment</h6></li><li><p>This is very good. The explanation is so clear and practical. The problems are very good. They are not too easy nor too difficult, and they are very practical. Those problems help me to apply the skills in the field</p><h6>-- Yonetaro Kawada, ABeam Consulting</h6></li><li><p>Excellent format, with flexibility to work whenever time is available, and work a bit ahead as needed to work around other committments</p><h6>-- Michelle MacKinnon, SanDisk</h6></li><li><p><div>I have to say that I learned more about statistics in one month with Statistics.com than I learned in a full quarter of engineering statistics as an undergrad 20 years ago. The resampling concept makes all the difference in the world. I now more fully understand what is behind the mathematical concepts they tried to teach me in college.</div></p><h6>-- Jeff Cox, City of Columbus</h6></li>
