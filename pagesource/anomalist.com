<div class='description'>Astronomers are using <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/artificial-intelligence-nasa-data-used-to-discover-eighth-planet-circling-distant-star" target="_blank">AIs and neural networks</a> to plow through mountains of data, so why not the Holy Roman Catholic Church? The Vatican's resident librarians don't know what they're sitting on since there's <i>so much</i>. We do find humor with the rumor over the Vatican possessing the world's largest collection of pornography, and now they're finally getting a computer to look at it. Computers are the reason pornography exists, and vice versa, right? Also from the frontiers of this godless and lawless internet, <i>Coast2CoastAM</i>'s most wanted, Tim "Two Gun" Binnall learned the hard way about <a href="https://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/youtube_to_use_wikipedia_to_thwart_conspiracy_theory_videos" target="_blank">YouTube to Use Wikipedia To Thwart Conspiracy Theory Videos</a>. Fair enough, but what happens when Guerilla Skeptics link to "paranormal" articles heavily skewed towards positivist dogma? Speaking of computers, we contacted Brent Swancer because <i>The Anomalist</i>'s office laptop's been acting hinky, but our antivirus isn't worth a damn. Brent's response? <a href="http://mysteriousuniverse.org/2018/03/computer-problems-it-could-be-possessed-by-a-demon/" target="_blank">Computer Problems? It Could Be Possessed By A Demon</a>. Bad enough the DHS/TSA/FBI/CIA/NSA/LOL knows what's being read and watched off-the-clock, nobody don't need Satan getting in on the act. As always, Brent's exhaustive research turns up more than a few nuggets of fortean treasure! (CS)</div><br />

<div class='description'>Keeping with the theme, sometimes spirits, not viruses, make people ill. It's an ancient tradition appreciated by shamans, but not the Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital. Someone forgot to call security the other day, and either a local witch doctor screwed up healing, or succeeded in cursing, a patient. There are anecdotal reports of spirituality's pallative effects. Some of theses cases are so provocative, K.C.

<div class='description'>"Location, location, location" is the mantra of real estate agents. Same goes for exo-economists concerned with filthy lucre. How could a post-scarcity civilization exist without heavy elements like gold, latinum, and unobtanium? Avi Loeb considers the elemental windfalls of supernovae among other cosmic catastrophes.

<div class='description'>Space is weird, but the effects of being in space are even weirder. Just ask Reed and Sue Richards, Johnny Storm, and the ever-lovin' Ben Grimm. Except Scott Kelly's changes aren't as visible, nor profound, yet Sequoyah Kennedy finds much to be of interest with the preliminary findings of NASA's twin study. Better still, she's level headed rather than <a href="https://i.imgur.com/F6AK3c0.jpg" target="_blank">going off the deep end</a> like some folks.

Her issue lay with the science-y mainstream media doing its best imitation of Carl deGrasse Hawking, and falling flat on its face, unlike <i>Mysterious Universe</i>.

<div class='description'>If <i>The Anomalist</i>'s love affair with <i>Mysterious Universe</i> is wrong, then we don't wanna be right. Friday night we cuddled up with Micah Hanks who whispered the latest and greatest hypotheses surrounding the Dyatlov Pass incident. From yetis to secret weapon programs, there's plenty breathing new life into this (literal) cold case. Which reminds us of the first time we met Brent Swancer. It was 1975. Waukegan, Wisconsin just after sunset. Jim Croce's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO1rMeYnOmM" target="_blank">Time In A Bottle</a> wafted from his Chevy Vega's radio. Brent whispered some <a href="http://mysteriousuniverse.org/2018/03/very-strange-accounts-of-bizarre-time-anomalies/" target="_blank">Very Strange Accounts Of Bizarre Time Anomalies</a> in confidence, but now he's let the cat out of the bag.

<div class='description'>What has to be one of the longest headlines ever introduces four posts presenting facets of the collision of UFOs with celebrity and media. In what has become fashionable of entertainers lately, long-time British pop singer Kim Wilde tells an English panel show about a rather pedestrian 2009 sighting she says inspired her new album. Paul Seaburn features a possibly even stranger title with <a href="http://mysteriousuniverse.org/2018/03/gucci-guru-claims-shes-part-alien-and-all-powerful/" target="_blank">"Gucci Guru" Claims She's Part Alien and All Powerful</a>. If Kim's claims seem a bit "Wilde," they pale next to New Age spiritualist Teal Swan's statements about her past, her powers, her beliefs, and her supposed Arcturian relatives. Robbie Graham's <a href="http://mysteriousuniverse.org/2018/03/the-reality-behind-earth-vs-the-flying-saucers/" target="_blank">The Reality behind 'Earth vs. the Flying Saucers'</a> considers possible real-world influences on the classic 1956 sci-fi movie. Graham's <a href="http://mysteriousuniverse.org/2018/03/when-disney-went-to-the-moon-with-aliens/" target="_blank">When Disney went to the Moon with Aliens</a> is in much the same vein. Graham here focuses on the appearance and motivations of the aliens themselves, especially as demonstrated in the definitely not-classic 1962 Disney movie <i>Moon Pilot</i>. Perhaps the Disney production was more influential on some levels than its lack of fame would indicate--having seen this movie just once when it came out, this reader can still sing (poorly) its "kitsch ballad about Beta Lyrae"!

<div class='description'>Paul Seaburn keeps us up to date on the apparently unravelling three-fingered mummy mystery, with Dr. Konstantin Korotkov still clinging to diminishing hopes that the Gaia.com-backed project is going to turn up anything truly earth-shattering. The possibility of active hoax and archaeological malfeasance, of course, remains. So, too, does the likelihood of Russian use of the mummies "as political weapons to undermine the West," at least according to Jason Colavito in <a href="http://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/russians-push-alien-peruvian-mummy-narrative-plus-forgery-scandal-calls-ancient-luwian-inscriptions-into-question" target="_blank">Russians Push "Alien" Peruvian Mummy Narrative; Plus: Forgery Scandal Calls Ancient Luwian Inscriptions into Question</a>. That last part of Colavito's title indicates that a major scandal in mainstream archaeology threatens to undermine what we've thought for some time about the mysterious Luwian people--and possibly others, as well. With <a href="http://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/l-a-marzullis-skull-expert-speaks-out-about-paracas-sub-species" target="_blank">L.A.

<div class='description'>A globetrotting selection of UFO-related cases begins with the December 1978 UFO event that stunned an Australian film crew in the moonlit night sky over New Zealand. The attached video clip is worthwhile, although the TV talent does not seem particularly well-informed or disposed towards the subject. They are, however, impressed by the number of Facebook and email respones to their request for local UFO stories.

<div class='description'>We enjoyed this piece, largely because we don't very often get first hand reports of poltergeist activity. Even revisiting the phenomenon two decades later, it's just plain weird and creepy. Cropster's comment that he didn't realize he was scared until returning home and jumping at every sound added some credibility to a story that already had us looking over our shoulders.

<div class='description'>Even demons get the blues sometimes, it would seem. The down-and-out-lover of this story, an incubus, could not turn the head of his righteous amour who was so in love with her husband that she could love no other.

<div class='description'>Nick Redfern offers an interview with the late Colin Bennett on the meaning and role of the UFO Contactee phenomenon. It's thoughtful and provocative.

A "mummy-like" Appell, a "Leader" sporting three "feathers" on his head, and hostile "Energy People": the late-60s "Contactee" business that enmeshed Keel seems rather different in tenor than Bennett's observations.

So says Fox News' Tucker Carlson of the situation illustrated by the third of three videos recently released by the U.S. government showing unidentified objects. Carlson admirably admits he has been one of the many scoffers of the UFO subject--up to now--while running former Pentagon UFO study head Luis Elizondo through the usual series of questions. Of interest was Elizondo's mentioning "hypersonic" speeds for some of these UFOs, while each of the quartet of different estimates of object size and speed we have encountered project much slower velocities for the target in this newest "GO FAST" video. There's also speculation that the GO FAST and GIMBAL videos came from the same 2015 US Navy F/A-18 Super Hornet sortie, as on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyII/comments/840ecy/buckle_up_boys_youre_about_to_get_learnt_a_little/" target="_blank">Buckle up Boys--You're about to Get Learnt.

<div class='description'>Nick discusses his new book with Greg Bishop. Although everyone traces the history of the Slenderman to a 2009 internet contest to come up with the most frightening character imaginable, Nick found that things resembling the entity had actually been reported before it was even "created." That led to a discussion of the possibility and history of manifested thoughtforms and tulpas, and how the Slenderman legend may have literally come to life. Turns out not everyone is a Nick Redfern fan, however. Jason Colavito takes aim at Redfern's latest book in <a href="http://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/review-of-the-slenderman-mysteries-by-nick-redfern" target="_blank">Review of "The Slenderman Mysteries" by Nick Redfern</a>, which is not surprising as Jason an Nick often butt heads on various issues. While Colavito doesn't criticize Nick's style or writing quality, he does look askance at what he deems Redfern's careless treatment of something that impacted the real world in a very violent way. Redfern himself is a much kinder reviewer, as you can see in his review of Tim Beckley's Global Communications latest tome: <a href="http://mysteriousuniverse.org/2018/02/weird-winged-wonders-reviewed/" target="_blank">Weird Winged Wonders: The Twilight World Of Cryptid Creatures</a>, which focuses largely on Mothman.

Just as still and motion picture film have been successfully manipulated to show things that aren't there, Hanks worries that advances in CGI fakery could demolish the probative value of any "UFO" footage. The provenance of the imagery is now crucial to evaluating the believability of the artifact. Hanks uses the 2004 Nimitz video as a case in point, although his concerns by themselves do not critically affect that video's authenticity. But, what if many "UFOs" aren't "nuts-and-bolts", material manifestations, but something metaphysical--and the government knows it?

<div class='description'>Feeling a little bit like "found footage," this video at first glance depicts a cab driving down the road at night being attacked by a directed burst of fog. It all seems a bit too specific to the single car though. Most of us have experienced fog while driving home at night, and it generally doesn't swirl in and dissipate quite so specifically as in this video. (Unless you're watching either the 1980 or 2005 remake of <i>The Fog</i>.) We're leaning in the direction of hoax without more information.

While there's not enough information to come up with any definitive explanation for these encounters, the possibility of a tall, raggedy, hairy hobo with a peg leg and a curious, non-aggressive manner traveling cross country is pretty close to non-existent.

<div class='description'>After about seven minutes of preliminaries, Greg Bishop and guest David Metcalfe seize full attention with their discussion of the Santa Muerte belief system(s), and keep that grip going across a wide range of subjects. The conversation flows naturally for the most part, conveying the sense that underlying mediumship, UFOs, and a night spent in jail with a bunch of drug dealers was some kind of common thread.
