Yummy salad, Arizona iced tea and catching up on some reads. Yesterday as I was heading into my massage at the spa I almost pulled out my phone to capture the experience. But I hesitated. I realized I was capturing it to prove something, not because I wanted to. It’s a question I’ve been asking myself a lot lately. “Is this a moment i want to capture and share or am I trying to prove my self-worth/status/self-love by sharing it?” If it’s the latter I put my phone down and walk away. It isn’t always an easy distinction but I’m getting better at it. It’s also making me so much more present and responsible when it comes to social media. I’ve always said that social media isn’t inherently bad, because it isn’t. But how we use it can be.
.
Capture and share those moments so others can share in them with you, but you are no less worthy if you do or don’t.

Back to reading✌️ P.S. what are you guys reading these days? Always love getting good book recommendations!

Need a sweet treat or a sensual experience? Treat yourself to a brownie. Feel like you want a well rounded meal to make you feel satisfied but not painfully bloated? Try something like my Macro Veggie Bowl. There is room for all foods in a balanced life! Food and eating should not contribute to your daily stress.

I get this question all the time: “What is intention and why should I do it?” I promised you this post months ago but life happened and truthfully my intention setting practice fell to the wayside. I wanted to get back on track before sharing this post with you. #ProgressISperfection!
.
I’ve been setting intentions since January 2017 when I realized I needed to shift my mentality from goals to intentions. Goals were always fleeting and truthfully, the “final destination” idea never felt right to me. I’ve been *mostly* consistent with my intention setting practice since then and honestly can say I’ve seen benefits in my life. It’s more the looking backwards that you realize what you’ve manifested, but I also find myself appreciating my abundance rather than focusing on my lack.
.
For anyone who has wanted to start an intention setting practice, this post is for you! We’re chatting about how intentions are different from goals, how to start an intention setting practice and how to make the practice your own. And thank you to my friends over at @lovemysilk for believing in me to write this post and for reminding all of us that Progress is Perfection! #ad

Congrats to everyone who has made it through the first week of the #THMStressRelief Challenge. Only a few more days left! I’ve loved receiving your IG messages, posts and emails. Really makes me so happy to see how many of you are trying out these practices. The goal is not to do every single one every single day but to try out everything and see what sticks. Sometimes less is more even if less means putting in a little bit more right now. I totally noticed the effects throughout the week but especially this weekend when I was fully able to disconnect and not let life’s daily stresses get in the way of enjoying my life. This only reinforces stress relief because you’re laughing, smiling and actually present in your life. The true antidote to stress👌🏼
.
You can still join the challenge by clicking the link in my bio! Can’t wait to finish this out strong💪 Also I’m currently obsessing over Bodhi and Rhett who are cuddling at my feet right now...please see stories for proof. LIFE MADE.
.
What’s your happy place???

Take some time to reflect on what you heard, smelled, thought about, etc. in the workbook! You know where to find it (in my profile 😉).

Reframe what ‘exercise’ looks like in your life. Exercise can be DANCING, taking a walk through the park to clear your mind, it can be swimming, it can be running around with your nieces and nephews or going to the park with your dog. Exercise does not have to mean a 1 hour, high intensity workout class everyday. How refreshing does it feel to hear that?!

There are thousands of trails around Bay Area but today, I’m focusing on 10 amazing hikes within city limits.

This list is for anyone visiting SF without access to a car or with limited time. There is so much to explore within these 10 hikes but I hope it gives you a starting point for your San Francisco visit!
.
Pro tip: never hike without the appropriate provisions. I never skimp on quality or flavor...even when I’m on the trail. By now, I doubt any of you are surprised by the fact that I have a bag (or 3) of @lorissaskitchen protein snacks with me at all times. You won’t find me hiking without them!

Happy hiking! #ad

Yummy salad, Arizona iced tea and catching up on some reads. Yesterday as I was heading into my massage at the spa I almost pulled out my phone to capture the experience. But I hesitated. I realized I was capturing it to prove something, not because I wanted to. It’s a question I’ve been asking myself a lot lately. “Is this a moment i want to capture and share or am I trying to prove my self-worth/status/self-love by sharing it?” If it’s the latter I put my phone down and walk away. It isn’t always an easy distinction but I’m getting better at it. It’s also making me so much more present and responsible when it comes to social media. I’ve always said that social media isn’t inherently bad, because it isn’t. But how we use it can be.

Capture and share those moments so others can share in them with you, but you are no less worthy if you do or don’t.

But really, the calorie conversation has gotten so old and TBH I can’t believe we’re still having it. But it needs to be said. Calories and calorie counting is an archaic and unrealistic way of looking at food. @nourishingmindsnutrition said it best in today’s new podcast episode - there’s a time and a place for calories, mostly in a hospital setting but for the most part they’re so far down on the list of what matters for our health. So happy to welcome these two beautiful 👸 queens 👸 onto the show today! Listen on iTunes, the blog or your favorite podcast player✌️

.
Sounds simple huh? It is but the truth is, we often go through our days without taking any deep breaths. Shallow, chest breathing can actually increase tension and anxiety. Deep breathing stimulates the vagus nerve which sends a message to your brain to chill out!
.
I shared my favorite breathing exercise in the workbook! If you haven’t grabbed yours yet, head to the link in my profile to download yours.

I get this question all the time: “What is intention and why should I do it?” I promised you this post months ago but life happened and truthfully my intention setting practice fell to the wayside. I wanted to get back on track before sharing this post with you. #ProgressISperfection!
.
I’ve been setting intentions since January 2017 when I realized I needed to shift my mentality from goals to intentions. Goals were always fleeting and truthfully, the “final destination” idea never felt right to me. I’ve been *mostly* consistent with my intention setting practice since then and honestly can say I’ve seen benefits in my life. It’s more the looking backwards that you realize what you’ve manifested, but I also find myself appreciating my abundance rather than focusing on my lack.
.
For anyone who has wanted to start an intention setting practice, this post is for you! We’re chatting about how intentions are different from goals, how to start an intention setting practice and how to make the practice your own. And thank you to my friends over at @lovemysilk for believing in me to write this post and for reminding all of us that Progress is Perfection! #ad

Congrats to everyone who has made it through the first week of the #THMStressRelief Challenge. Only a few more days left! I’ve loved receiving your IG messages, posts and emails. Really makes me so happy to see how many of you are trying out these practices. The goal is not to do every single one every single day but to try out everything and see what sticks. Sometimes less is more even if less means putting in a little bit more right now. I totally noticed the effects throughout the week but especially this weekend when I was fully able to disconnect and not let life’s daily stresses get in the way of enjoying my life. This only reinforces stress relief because you’re laughing, smiling and actually present in your life. The true antidote to stress👌🏼
.
You can still join the challenge by clicking the link in my bio! Can’t wait to finish this out strong💪 Also I’m currently obsessing over Bodhi and Rhett who are cuddling at my feet right now...please see stories for proof. LIFE MADE.
.
What’s your happy place???

I swear fresh air and sunshine solve 99% of my problems. Unplug from your electronics and just take some deep breaths outside. Do what you need - maybe that’s sitting in the grass or on a park bench or maybe that’s going for a walk. You do you.
.
Take some time to reflect on what you heard, smelled, thought about, etc. in the workbook! You know where to find it (in my profile 😉).

.
Reframe what ‘exercise’ looks like in your life. Exercise can be DANCING, taking a walk through the park to clear your mind, it can be swimming, it can be running around with your nieces and nephews or going to the park with your dog. Exercise does not have to mean a 1 hour, high intensity workout class everyday. How refreshing does it feel to hear that?!

Today, move in a way that feels good to y-o-u. If you’re not sure what this looks like, head to the workbook (link in profile) to answer some questions to navigate this!
