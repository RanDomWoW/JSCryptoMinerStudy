Lively turn out and compelling bidding resulted in strong results for Skinner’s mid-winter Fine Wines &amp; Rare Spirits live auction with an average sell-through rate of over 96%. The&nbsp;February 15th auction consisted of 484 lots of fine wines and rare spirits including extensive selections from two important collections: Winter’s Collection and The Nantucket Cellar continuing the Skinner tradition of scrupulously researched fine wines and rare spirits. The Winter’s collection included jaw-dropping Champagnes, a robust study in Rhones and an enviable collection of Barbarescos and Barolos from legendary vintages. Outstanding examples include: Champagne Salon, 1985 (Lot 14, 4 bottles, sold $3,567), an astounding wine made only in the best vintages entirely in the style of Blanc de Blancs.

Significant and wide-ranging participation by museums interested in adding to their public collections led the Skinner February 9th auction of the Collection of Avis and Eugene Robinson. More than twenty-six cultural and educational institutions, in this country and abroad, vied to bid on items from the collection of artifacts, documents, and photographs chronicling the full scope of African American history from enslavement to emancipation, from Jim Crow to Civil Rights to the present day.&nbsp; In all, the collection formed a rich mosaic portraying the complex, often painful, often triumphant history of a people. The auction’s top lot, selling for $12,300 in the room, was an archive of 18th -20th century documents and photographs from Rhode Island’s DeWolf family, the states most prominent family involved in the transatlantic slave trade.&nbsp; A framed “$100 Reward for Isaac Churcher,” went for $7380, while an 1833 broadside for the “Public [&hellip;]</p> </small> <a class="front-thumb" href="https://www.skinnerinc.com/news/blog/african-american-history-from-middle-passage-to-present-day-highlighted-in-skinner-auction/"> <img width="150" height="150" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/skn-wp-assets/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/14120028/1191244_VIEW-03-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" /> </a> </div> </article> </div><div class="controls"><a class="left_carousel ir prev" href="#">Previous</a><a class="right_carousel ir next" href="#">Next</a></div></div> </div> <div class="block module-tabbed_carousel"> <h2 class="block-title title-tabbed_carousel">Tabbed Carousel</h2> <div class="block-content"><h3 class="category_title">From the Blog</h3><div id="tab_container"> <article id="tabid-12904" class="tab_content item menu-0"> <div class="tab_content_inner"> <h2><a href="https://www.skinnerinc.com/news/blog/how-to-identify-pottery-art-and-studio-pottery-guide/">How to Identify Art and Studio Pottery</a></h2> <small><p>A Guide to Developing an Expert’s Eye &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I appraise valuable objects almost every single day, and I’m often asked how I identify a piece so quickly. The short answer is lots and lots of experience! But how does one go about obtaining that experience? That’s the longer answer. This visual checklist can help you begin to develop an expert’s eye when it comes to looking at and identifying pottery from Art Nouveau to present day studio pottery. 1. What is the glaze, finish, or decoration? Every potter and studio has a “visual signature,” meaning a style unique to that artist. Many people easily recognize the style of a Van Gogh or a Jackson Pollock painting – and the same type of familiarity is possible when it comes to pottery.&nbsp; Once you’ve seen enough examples of an artist’s work, you start to recognize similar pieces.

The value of a first edition copy of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s Tender is the Night with dust jacket is around $6,000. Without a dust jacket….$300. This huge difference in value is largely due to the fact that more than 90% of dust jackets are destroyed, either deliberately or due to their ephemeral and fragile nature. If you have one on a good book, treasure it.
