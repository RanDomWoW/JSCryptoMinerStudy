								<p>&#8220;I spent probably about two weeks looking for a good Microsoft Power BI class that would cover all of the aspects of the program. I wanted to walk away from the class being able to apply what I learned immediately. Most training companies that I looked into were in a state of flux with Power BI mostly due to the transitions that Power BI itself was going through. Then I stumbled on the RADACAD web site. Reza Rad touted a course that he taught named “Power BI, From Rookie to Rock star.” If the class was indeed an A to Z course, then it was exactly what I was looking for. The class outline seemed to include every topic on my checkoff list plus much more. I decided to give Reza a try.</p>
<p>Reza completely lived up to his hype. He took us through a natural progression of the software, using example after example of how to complete a task. We went through real world scenarios, a bare minimum of two scenarios for each minor topic. I was completely impressed with his Power BI knowledge, understanding and abilities. Any question we came to Reza with was answered completely and with even more examples.</p>
<p>After the class, my goal of immediately applying what I learned was attained. Right away I was able to successfully pull and massage data, create useful reports and post them to dashboards.</p>
<p>I would recommend Radacad Power BI Training without hesitation.&#8221;</p>

								<p>&#8220;Reza does not just know Power BI like the back of his hand, he is the most commercially aware BI person I know.  He understands that companies work in the real world and that data isn’t always clean and needs manipulation for it to work and be useful.  When Reza worked on our project, nothing phased or flustered him, he always came up with solutions for problems that seemed to me as insurmountable.  Can’t recommend him enough, invest in Reza as he will not only save you a whole heap of time, but he comes up with long lasting and very powerful Power BI solutions for your business.&#8221;</p>

								<p>&#8220;We have started to use Microsoft Power BI and whilst Microsoft tutorials are helpful, if you are not used to DAX then it is very difficult to get your head around and there is little other resources that don&#8217;t cost an arm and a leg.  I had a call with Reza who made my life so much easier in just under an hour!  Any time spent speaking to Reza will be well worth it &#8211; I have saved hours of trying to get my head around our dashboards by getting some very useful tips and explanations on why things are done the DAX way!  Not only that but he is very patient and straight forward.  Highly recommended!&#8221;</p>

								<p>“I attended Reza’s Power BI pre-con “From Rookie to Rock star” at SQL Saturday Brisbane in May 2016. I was a complete Power BI novice, having only previously accomplished a few very basic things with Power BI. Reza took the group through all the components that make up environment. He explained how they had evolved and took the group through walk-throughs of each one. Reza was great an answering questions from the audience at the event and going into extra detail if necessary. All-in all, I would say that I’m now a very confident Power BI user after attending Reza’s pre-con.”</p>

<h1>What others say about the training and trainer</h1>
<p><strong>Kenny McMillan, Sports Physiologist / Data Analyst, Frankfurt, Germany:</strong><br />
I attended RADACADs “Advanced Analytics” course recently in Frankfurt in May 2017. Being a regular user of Power BI (with a science background ) the course was extremely helpful in showing me how to incorporate R data visualizations into Power BI dashboards and for introducing me to machine learning using the Microsoft ML Studio. Leila is an excellent and extremely knowledgeable instructor and explained complex data analytical concepts and methodologies in an easy-to-understand manner. I thoroughly recommend this course to anyone who wants to expand their data analytical skills and knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Catherall (Microsoft Data Platform MVP):</strong></p>
<p>As part of SQL Saturday Auckland 2016 I attended an “Analytics with Power BI and R.” pre-con with Leila. Leila took the class&#8217;s knowledge from rudimentary to competent in a day. We first looked at R, the language and the software. Once these skills were obtained we started to look at Power BI and the integration that it has with R. We worked through a few examples and Leila answered all of the class’s questions and offered to provide supplementary material for some of the more advanced questions. I left the class feeling that my R and Power BI knowledge was at a competent level and ready to dive into some of the more advanced material that Leila provided.</p>

<p>What others say about the training and trainer;</p>
<p><strong>Daniel R Tuma, Senior Systems Analyst at Cleveland Metro Schools, United States</strong></p>
<p>I spent probably about two weeks looking for a good Microsoft Power BI class that would cover all of the aspects of the program. I wanted to walk away from the class being able to apply what I learned immediately. Most training companies that I looked into were in a state of flux with Power BI mostly due to the transitions that Power BI itself was going through. Then I stumbled on the RADACAD web site. Reza Rad touted a course that he taught named “Power BI, From Rookie to Rock star.” If the class was indeed an A to Z course, then it was exactly what I was looking for. The class outline seemed to include every topic on my checkoff list plus much more. I decided to give Reza a try.</p>
<p>Reza completely lived up to his hype. He took us through a natural progression of the software, using example after example of how to complete a task. We went through real world scenarios, a bare minimum of two scenarios for each minor topic. I was completely impressed with his Power BI knowledge, understanding and abilities. Any question we came to Reza with was answered completely and with even more examples.</p>
<p>After the class, my goal of immediately applying what I learned was attained. Right away I was able to successfully pull and massage data, create useful reports and post them to dashboards.</p>
<p>I would recommend Radacad Power BI Training without hesitation.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Weir; Independent Consultant, Wellington, New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>I learned a lot from this course: it gave a great overview of what&#8217;s possible both right from the UI, and what more awaits if you lift the hood and pimp the engine. It’s incredible to see just how much PowerBI and PowerQuery radically simplify what I would otherwise have to do with many, many lines of complicated VBA code. And Reza is a masterful user of this tool.</p>
<p>Note that Reza covers a lot of ground in this course, and it is pretty fast paced. While you can take a laptop and follow along as Reza takes PowerBI/Powerquery through its paces, for the one-day course my recommendation would be to keep that laptop closed, and simply sit back and watch Reza in action, so you can fully concentrate on just how simple this tool is to use in the right hands as well as think about how you might use the tool to your own ends and ask questions along those lines. You can always purchase the video course (if it’s not already included in your course) and step through the material again at your own pace.</p>
<p><strong>Rob Wilby; Independent Consultant, UK</strong></p>
<p>I must say your “Power BI Essentials” course has been the most comprehensive Power BI course I have found to date and seeing how you work with data especially the little tricks naturally introduced at just the right moments has made this course a pleasure to take.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Catherall – Data Platform MVP, PASS Regional Mentor</strong></p>
<p>I attended Reza’s Power BI pre-con “From Rookie to Rock star” at SQL Saturday Brisbane in May 2016. I was a complete Power BI novice, having only previously accomplished a few very basic things with Power BI. Reza took the group through all the components that make up environment. He explained how they had evolved and took the group through walk-throughs of each one. Reza was great an answering questions from the audience at the event and going into extra detail if necessary. All-in all, I would say that I’m now a very confident Power BI user after attending Reza’s pre-con.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Cheshire, Senior Project Manager Air New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>Reza does not just know Power BI like the back of his hand, he is the most commercially aware BI person I know.  He understands that companies work in the real world and that data isn’t always clean and needs manipulation for it to work and be useful.  When Reza worked on our project, nothing phased or flustered him, he always came up with solutions for problems that seemed to me as insurmountable.  Can’t recommend him enough, invest in Reza as he will not only save you a whole heap of time, but he comes up with long lasting and very powerful Power BI solutions for your business.</p>
<p><strong>Sonia Buckley, Data Analyst at Zoom2u, Sydney, Australia</strong></p>
<p>We have started to use Microsoft Power BI and whilst Microsoft tutorials are helpful, if you are not used to DAX then it is very difficult to get your head around and there is little other resources that don’t cost an arm and a leg.  I had a call with Reza who made my life so much easier in just under an hour!  Any time spent speaking to Reza will be well worth it – I have saved hours of trying to get my head around our dashboards by getting some very useful tips and explanations on why things are done the DAX way!  Not only that but he is very patient and straight forward.  Highly recommended!</p>

<h1>What others say about the training and trainer</h1>

<p><strong>Jeffrey Weir; Independent Consultant, Wellington, New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>I learned a lot from this course: it gave a great overview of what&#8217;s possible both right from the UI, and what more awaits if you lift the hood and pimp the engine. It’s incredible to see just how much PowerBI and PowerQuery radically simplify what I would otherwise have to do with many, many lines of complicated VBA code. And Reza is a masterful user of this tool.</p>
<p>Note that Reza covers a lot of ground in this course, and it is pretty fast paced. While you can take a laptop and follow along as Reza takes PowerBI/Powerquery through its paces, for the one-day course my recommendation would be to keep that laptop closed, and simply sit back and watch Reza in action, so you can fully concentrate on just how simple this tool is to use in the right hands as well as think about how you might use the tool to your own ends and ask questions along those lines. You can always purchase the video course (if it’s not already included in your course) and step through the material again at your own pace.</p>
<p><strong>Rob Wilby; Independent Consultant, UK</strong></p>
<p>I must say your “Power BI Essentials” course has been the most comprehensive Power BI course I have found to date and seeing how you work with data especially the little tricks naturally introduced at just the right moments has made this course a pleasure to take.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Catherall – Data Platform MVP, PASS Regional Mentor</strong></p>
<p>I attended Reza’s Power BI pre-con “From Rookie to Rock star” at SQL Saturday Brisbane in May 2016. I was a complete Power BI novice, having only previously accomplished a few very basic things with Power BI. Reza took the group through all the components that make up environment. He explained how they had evolved and took the group through walk-throughs of each one. Reza was great an answering questions from the audience at the event and going into extra detail if necessary. All-in all, I would say that I’m now a very confident Power BI user after attending Reza’s pre-con.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Cheshire, Senior Project Manager Air New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>Reza does not just know Power BI like the back of his hand, he is the most commercially aware BI person I know.  He understands that companies work in the real world and that data isn’t always clean and needs manipulation for it to work and be useful.  When Reza worked on our project, nothing phased or flustered him, he always came up with solutions for problems that seemed to me as insurmountable.  Can’t recommend him enough, invest in Reza as he will not only save you a whole heap of time, but he comes up with long lasting and very powerful Power BI solutions for your business.</p>
<p><strong>Sonia Buckley, Data Analyst at Zoom2u, Sydney, Australia</strong></p>
<p>We have started to use Microsoft Power BI and whilst Microsoft tutorials are helpful, if you are not used to DAX then it is very difficult to get your head around and there is little other resources that don’t cost an arm and a leg.  I had a call with Reza who made my life so much easier in just under an hour!  Any time spent speaking to Reza will be well worth it – I have saved hours of trying to get my head around our dashboards by getting some very useful tips and explanations on why things are done the DAX way!  Not only that but he is very patient and straight forward.  Highly recommended!</p>

<p>What others say about the training and trainer;</p>
<p><strong>Daniel R Tuma, Senior Systems Analyst at Cleveland Metro Schools, United States</strong></p>
<p>I spent probably about two weeks looking for a good Microsoft Power BI class that would cover all of the aspects of the program. I wanted to walk away from the class being able to apply what I learned immediately. Most training companies that I looked into were in a state of flux with Power BI mostly due to the transitions that Power BI itself was going through. Then I stumbled on the RADACAD web site. Reza Rad touted a course that he taught named “Power BI, From Rookie to Rock star.” If the class was indeed an A to Z course, then it was exactly what I was looking for. The class outline seemed to include every topic on my checkoff list plus much more. I decided to give Reza a try.</p>
<p>Reza completely lived up to his hype. He took us through a natural progression of the software, using example after example of how to complete a task. We went through real world scenarios, a bare minimum of two scenarios for each minor topic. I was completely impressed with his Power BI knowledge, understanding and abilities. Any question we came to Reza with was answered completely and with even more examples.</p>
<p>After the class, my goal of immediately applying what I learned was attained. Right away I was able to successfully pull and massage data, create useful reports and post them to dashboards.</p>
<p>I would recommend Radacad Power BI Training without hesitation.</p>

<h1>What others say about the training and trainer</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Weir; Independent Consultant, Wellington, New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>I learned a lot from this course: it gave a great overview of what&#8217;s possible both right from the UI, and what more awaits if you lift the hood and pimp the engine. It’s incredible to see just how much PowerBI and PowerQuery radically simplify what I would otherwise have to do with many, many lines of complicated VBA code. And Reza is a masterful user of this tool.</p>
<p>Note that Reza covers a lot of ground in this course, and it is pretty fast paced. While you can take a laptop and follow along as Reza takes PowerBI/Powerquery through its paces, for the one-day course my recommendation would be to keep that laptop closed, and simply sit back and watch Reza in action, so you can fully concentrate on just how simple this tool is to use in the right hands as well as think about how you might use the tool to your own ends and ask questions along those lines. You can always purchase the video course (if it’s not already included in your course) and step through the material again at your own pace.</p>
<p><strong>Rob Wilby; Independent Consultant, UK</strong></p>
<p>I must say your “Power BI Essentials” course has been the most comprehensive Power BI course I have found to date and seeing how you work with data especially the little tricks naturally introduced at just the right moments has made this course a pleasure to take.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Catherall – Data Platform MVP, PASS Regional Mentor</strong></p>
<p>I attended Reza’s Power BI pre-con “From Rookie to Rock star” at SQL Saturday Brisbane in May 2016. I was a complete Power BI novice, having only previously accomplished a few very basic things with Power BI. Reza took the group through all the components that make up environment. He explained how they had evolved and took the group through walk-throughs of each one. Reza was great an answering questions from the audience at the event and going into extra detail if necessary. All-in all, I would say that I’m now a very confident Power BI user after attending Reza’s pre-con.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Cheshire, Senior Project Manager Air New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>Reza does not just know Power BI like the back of his hand, he is the most commercially aware BI person I know.  He understands that companies work in the real world and that data isn’t always clean and needs manipulation for it to work and be useful.  When Reza worked on our project, nothing phased or flustered him, he always came up with solutions for problems that seemed to me as insurmountable.  Can’t recommend him enough, invest in Reza as he will not only save you a whole heap of time, but he comes up with long lasting and very powerful Power BI solutions for your business.</p>
<p><strong>Sonia Buckley, Data Analyst at Zoom2u, Sydney, Australia</strong></p>
<p>We have started to use Microsoft Power BI and whilst Microsoft tutorials are helpful, if you are not used to DAX then it is very difficult to get your head around and there is little other resources that don’t cost an arm and a leg.  I had a call with Reza who made my life so much easier in just under an hour!  Any time spent speaking to Reza will be well worth it – I have saved hours of trying to get my head around our dashboards by getting some very useful tips and explanations on why things are done the DAX way!  Not only that but he is very patient and straight forward.  Highly recommended!</p>

<p><strong>Martin Catherall (Microsoft Data Platform MVP):</strong></p>
<p>As part of SQL Saturday Auckland 2016 I attended an “Analytics with Power BI and R.” pre-con with Leila. Leila took the class&#8217;s knowledge from rudimentary to competent in a day. We first looked at R, the language and the software. Once these skills were obtained we started to look at Power BI and the integration that it has with R. We worked through a few examples and Leila answered all of the class’s questions and offered to provide supplementary material for some of the more advanced questions. I left the class feeling that my R and Power BI knowledge was at a competent level and ready to dive into some of the more advanced material that Leila provided.</p>

<p>What others say about the training and trainer;</p>
<p><strong>Daniel R Tuma, Senior Systems Analyst at Cleveland Metro Schools, United States</strong></p>
<p>I spent probably about two weeks looking for a good Microsoft Power BI class that would cover all of the aspects of the program. I wanted to walk away from the class being able to apply what I learned immediately. Most training companies that I looked into were in a state of flux with Power BI mostly due to the transitions that Power BI itself was going through. Then I stumbled on the RADACAD web site. Reza Rad touted a course that he taught named “Power BI, From Rookie to Rock star.” If the class was indeed an A to Z course, then it was exactly what I was looking for. The class outline seemed to include every topic on my checkoff list plus much more. I decided to give Reza a try.</p>
<p>Reza completely lived up to his hype. He took us through a natural progression of the software, using example after example of how to complete a task. We went through real world scenarios, a bare minimum of two scenarios for each minor topic. I was completely impressed with his Power BI knowledge, understanding and abilities. Any question we came to Reza with was answered completely and with even more examples.</p>
<p>After the class, my goal of immediately applying what I learned was attained. Right away I was able to successfully pull and massage data, create useful reports and post them to dashboards.</p>
<p>I would recommend Radacad Power BI Training without hesitation.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Weir; Independent Consultant, Wellington, New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>I learned a lot from this course: it gave a great overview of what&#8217;s possible both right from the UI, and what more awaits if you lift the hood and pimp the engine. It’s incredible to see just how much PowerBI and PowerQuery radically simplify what I would otherwise have to do with many, many lines of complicated VBA code. And Reza is a masterful user of this tool.</p>
<p>Note that Reza covers a lot of ground in this course, and it is pretty fast paced. While you can take a laptop and follow along as Reza takes PowerBI/Powerquery through its paces, for the one-day course my recommendation would be to keep that laptop closed, and simply sit back and watch Reza in action, so you can fully concentrate on just how simple this tool is to use in the right hands as well as think about how you might use the tool to your own ends and ask questions along those lines. You can always purchase the video course (if it’s not already included in your course) and step through the material again at your own pace.</p>
<p><strong>Rob Wilby; Independent Consultant, UK</strong></p>
<p>I must say your “Power BI Essentials” course has been the most comprehensive Power BI course I have found to date and seeing how you work with data especially the little tricks naturally introduced at just the right moments has made this course a pleasure to take.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Catherall – Data Platform MVP, PASS Regional Mentor</strong></p>
<p>I attended Reza’s Power BI pre-con “From Rookie to Rock star” at SQL Saturday Brisbane in May 2016. I was a complete Power BI novice, having only previously accomplished a few very basic things with Power BI. Reza took the group through all the components that make up environment. He explained how they had evolved and took the group through walk-throughs of each one. Reza was great an answering questions from the audience at the event and going into extra detail if necessary. All-in all, I would say that I’m now a very confident Power BI user after attending Reza’s pre-con.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Cheshire, Senior Project Manager Air New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>Reza does not just know Power BI like the back of his hand, he is the most commercially aware BI person I know.  He understands that companies work in the real world and that data isn’t always clean and needs manipulation for it to work and be useful.  When Reza worked on our project, nothing phased or flustered him, he always came up with solutions for problems that seemed to me as insurmountable.  Can’t recommend him enough, invest in Reza as he will not only save you a whole heap of time, but he comes up with long lasting and very powerful Power BI solutions for your business.</p>
<p><strong>Sonia Buckley, Data Analyst at Zoom2u, Sydney, Australia</strong></p>
<p>We have started to use Microsoft Power BI and whilst Microsoft tutorials are helpful, if you are not used to DAX then it is very difficult to get your head around and there is little other resources that don’t cost an arm and a leg.  I had a call with Reza who made my life so much easier in just under an hour!  Any time spent speaking to Reza will be well worth it – I have saved hours of trying to get my head around our dashboards by getting some very useful tips and explanations on why things are done the DAX way!  Not only that but he is very patient and straight forward.  Highly recommended!</p>

<h1>What others say about the training and trainer</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Weir; Independent Consultant, Wellington, New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>I learned a lot from this course: it gave a great overview of what&#8217;s possible both right from the UI, and what more awaits if you lift the hood and pimp the engine. It’s incredible to see just how much PowerBI and PowerQuery radically simplify what I would otherwise have to do with many, many lines of complicated VBA code. And Reza is a masterful user of this tool.</p>
<p>Note that Reza covers a lot of ground in this course, and it is pretty fast paced. While you can take a laptop and follow along as Reza takes PowerBI/Powerquery through its paces, for the one-day course my recommendation would be to keep that laptop closed, and simply sit back and watch Reza in action, so you can fully concentrate on just how simple this tool is to use in the right hands as well as think about how you might use the tool to your own ends and ask questions along those lines. You can always purchase the video course (if it’s not already included in your course) and step through the material again at your own pace.</p>
<p><strong>Rob Wilby; Independent Consultant, UK</strong></p>
<p>I must say your “Power BI Essentials” course has been the most comprehensive Power BI course I have found to date and seeing how you work with data especially the little tricks naturally introduced at just the right moments has made this course a pleasure to take.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Catherall – Data Platform MVP, PASS Regional Mentor</strong></p>
<p>I attended Reza’s Power BI pre-con “From Rookie to Rock star” at SQL Saturday Brisbane in May 2016. I was a complete Power BI novice, having only previously accomplished a few very basic things with Power BI. Reza took the group through all the components that make up environment. He explained how they had evolved and took the group through walk-throughs of each one. Reza was great an answering questions from the audience at the event and going into extra detail if necessary. All-in all, I would say that I’m now a very confident Power BI user after attending Reza’s pre-con.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Cheshire, Senior Project Manager Air New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>Reza does not just know Power BI like the back of his hand, he is the most commercially aware BI person I know.  He understands that companies work in the real world and that data isn’t always clean and needs manipulation for it to work and be useful.  When Reza worked on our project, nothing phased or flustered him, he always came up with solutions for problems that seemed to me as insurmountable.  Can’t recommend him enough, invest in Reza as he will not only save you a whole heap of time, but he comes up with long lasting and very powerful Power BI solutions for your business.</p>
<p><strong>Sonia Buckley, Data Analyst at Zoom2u, Sydney, Australia</strong></p>
<p>We have started to use Microsoft Power BI and whilst Microsoft tutorials are helpful, if you are not used to DAX then it is very difficult to get your head around and there is little other resources that don’t cost an arm and a leg.  I had a call with Reza who made my life so much easier in just under an hour!  Any time spent speaking to Reza will be well worth it – I have saved hours of trying to get my head around our dashboards by getting some very useful tips and explanations on why things are done the DAX way!  Not only that but he is very patient and straight forward.  Highly recommended!</p>

<h1>What others say about the training and trainer</h1>
<p><strong>Kenny McMillan, Sports Physiologist / Data Analyst, Frankfurt, Germany:</strong><br />
I attended RADACADs “Advanced Analytics” course recently in Frankfurt in May 2017. Being a regular user of Power BI (with a science background ) the course was extremely helpful in showing me how to incorporate R data visualizations into Power BI dashboards and for introducing me to machine learning using the Microsoft ML Studio. Leila is an excellent and extremely knowledgeable instructor and explained complex data analytical concepts and methodologies in an easy-to-understand manner. I thoroughly recommend this course to anyone who wants to expand their data analytical skills and knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Catherall (Microsoft Data Platform MVP):</strong></p>
<p>As part of SQL Saturday Auckland 2016 I attended an “Analytics with Power BI and R.” pre-con with Leila. Leila took the class&#8217;s knowledge from rudimentary to competent in a day. We first looked at R, the language and the software. Once these skills were obtained we started to look at Power BI and the integration that it has with R. We worked through a few examples and Leila answered all of the class’s questions and offered to provide supplementary material for some of the more advanced questions. I left the class feeling that my R and Power BI knowledge was at a competent level and ready to dive into some of the more advanced material that Leila provided.</p>

<p>What others say about the training and trainer;</p>
<p><strong>Daniel R Tuma, Senior Systems Analyst at Cleveland Metro Schools, United States</strong></p>
<p>I spent probably about two weeks looking for a good Microsoft Power BI class that would cover all of the aspects of the program. I wanted to walk away from the class being able to apply what I learned immediately. Most training companies that I looked into were in a state of flux with Power BI mostly due to the transitions that Power BI itself was going through. Then I stumbled on the RADACAD web site. Reza Rad touted a course that he taught named “Power BI, From Rookie to Rock star.” If the class was indeed an A to Z course, then it was exactly what I was looking for. The class outline seemed to include every topic on my checkoff list plus much more. I decided to give Reza a try.</p>
<p>Reza completely lived up to his hype. He took us through a natural progression of the software, using example after example of how to complete a task. We went through real world scenarios, a bare minimum of two scenarios for each minor topic. I was completely impressed with his Power BI knowledge, understanding and abilities. Any question we came to Reza with was answered completely and with even more examples.</p>
<p>After the class, my goal of immediately applying what I learned was attained. Right away I was able to successfully pull and massage data, create useful reports and post them to dashboards.</p>
<p>I would recommend Radacad Power BI Training without hesitation.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Weir; Independent Consultant, Wellington, New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>I learned a lot from this course: it gave a great overview of what&#8217;s possible both right from the UI, and what more awaits if you lift the hood and pimp the engine. It’s incredible to see just how much PowerBI and PowerQuery radically simplify what I would otherwise have to do with many, many lines of complicated VBA code. And Reza is a masterful user of this tool.</p>
<p>Note that Reza covers a lot of ground in this course, and it is pretty fast paced. While you can take a laptop and follow along as Reza takes PowerBI/Powerquery through its paces, for the one-day course my recommendation would be to keep that laptop closed, and simply sit back and watch Reza in action, so you can fully concentrate on just how simple this tool is to use in the right hands as well as think about how you might use the tool to your own ends and ask questions along those lines. You can always purchase the video course (if it’s not already included in your course) and step through the material again at your own pace.</p>
<p><strong>Rob Wilby; Independent Consultant, UK</strong></p>
<p>I must say your “Power BI Essentials” course has been the most comprehensive Power BI course I have found to date and seeing how you work with data especially the little tricks naturally introduced at just the right moments has made this course a pleasure to take.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Catherall – Data Platform MVP, PASS Regional Mentor</strong></p>
<p>I attended Reza’s Power BI pre-con “From Rookie to Rock star” at SQL Saturday Brisbane in May 2016. I was a complete Power BI novice, having only previously accomplished a few very basic things with Power BI. Reza took the group through all the components that make up environment. He explained how they had evolved and took the group through walk-throughs of each one. Reza was great an answering questions from the audience at the event and going into extra detail if necessary. All-in all, I would say that I’m now a very confident Power BI user after attending Reza’s pre-con.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Cheshire, Senior Project Manager Air New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>Reza does not just know Power BI like the back of his hand, he is the most commercially aware BI person I know.  He understands that companies work in the real world and that data isn’t always clean and needs manipulation for it to work and be useful.  When Reza worked on our project, nothing phased or flustered him, he always came up with solutions for problems that seemed to me as insurmountable.  Can’t recommend him enough, invest in Reza as he will not only save you a whole heap of time, but he comes up with long lasting and very powerful Power BI solutions for your business.</p>
<p><strong>Sonia Buckley, Data Analyst at Zoom2u, Sydney, Australia</strong></p>
<p>We have started to use Microsoft Power BI and whilst Microsoft tutorials are helpful, if you are not used to DAX then it is very difficult to get your head around and there is little other resources that don’t cost an arm and a leg.  I had a call with Reza who made my life so much easier in just under an hour!  Any time spent speaking to Reza will be well worth it – I have saved hours of trying to get my head around our dashboards by getting some very useful tips and explanations on why things are done the DAX way!  Not only that but he is very patient and straight forward.  Highly recommended!</p>

<h1>What others say about the training and trainer</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Weir; Independent Consultant, Wellington, New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>I learned a lot from this course: it gave a great overview of what&#8217;s possible both right from the UI, and what more awaits if you lift the hood and pimp the engine. It’s incredible to see just how much PowerBI and PowerQuery radically simplify what I would otherwise have to do with many, many lines of complicated VBA code. And Reza is a masterful user of this tool.</p>
<p>Note that Reza covers a lot of ground in this course, and it is pretty fast paced. While you can take a laptop and follow along as Reza takes PowerBI/Powerquery through its paces, for the one-day course my recommendation would be to keep that laptop closed, and simply sit back and watch Reza in action, so you can fully concentrate on just how simple this tool is to use in the right hands as well as think about how you might use the tool to your own ends and ask questions along those lines. You can always purchase the video course (if it’s not already included in your course) and step through the material again at your own pace.</p>
<p><strong>Rob Wilby; Independent Consultant, UK</strong></p>
<p>I must say your “Power BI Essentials” course has been the most comprehensive Power BI course I have found to date and seeing how you work with data especially the little tricks naturally introduced at just the right moments has made this course a pleasure to take.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Catherall – Data Platform MVP, PASS Regional Mentor</strong></p>
<p>I attended Reza’s Power BI pre-con “From Rookie to Rock star” at SQL Saturday Brisbane in May 2016. I was a complete Power BI novice, having only previously accomplished a few very basic things with Power BI. Reza took the group through all the components that make up environment. He explained how they had evolved and took the group through walk-throughs of each one. Reza was great an answering questions from the audience at the event and going into extra detail if necessary. All-in all, I would say that I’m now a very confident Power BI user after attending Reza’s pre-con.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Cheshire, Senior Project Manager Air New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>Reza does not just know Power BI like the back of his hand, he is the most commercially aware BI person I know.  He understands that companies work in the real world and that data isn’t always clean and needs manipulation for it to work and be useful.  When Reza worked on our project, nothing phased or flustered him, he always came up with solutions for problems that seemed to me as insurmountable.  Can’t recommend him enough, invest in Reza as he will not only save you a whole heap of time, but he comes up with long lasting and very powerful Power BI solutions for your business.</p>
<p><strong>Sonia Buckley, Data Analyst at Zoom2u, Sydney, Australia</strong></p>
<p>We have started to use Microsoft Power BI and whilst Microsoft tutorials are helpful, if you are not used to DAX then it is very difficult to get your head around and there is little other resources that don’t cost an arm and a leg.  I had a call with Reza who made my life so much easier in just under an hour!  Any time spent speaking to Reza will be well worth it – I have saved hours of trying to get my head around our dashboards by getting some very useful tips and explanations on why things are done the DAX way!  Not only that but he is very patient and straight forward.  Highly recommended!</p>

<h1>Why Power BI Training?</h1>
<p>Power BI is the newest Microsoft BI tool for data mash up, build modelling, and visualize it effectively. It supports mobile devices, it support self-service, and along with its great functionalities, it doesn’t require heavy development or production system.</p>
<h1>Common Myths about Power BI</h1>
<p>There are some myths about Power BI that sometimes prevents people and organization to move towards using this product. We’ve listed some of myths in following. Please note that these are Myths, and they are not right assumptions.</p>
<h2>Myth 1: Power BI is a self-service Excel tool, and isn’t suitable for Enterprise Solutions.</h2>
<p>There are many scenarios that Power BI has been used in enterprise solutions. Power BI features for data mash up (with the very powerful data transformation component: Power Query), and data modelling  based on xVelocity in-memory engine (Power Pivot), and great data visualization components such as Power View and Power Map, along with mobility support of this product, are rarely available in other products. We have designed, implemented and have seem many BI enterprise solutions based on Power BI within very large organizations.</p>
<h2>Myth 2: Power BI is easy to use, and doesn’t require training course.</h2>
<p>Power BI is an easy to use tool, but for basic functions. Every BI application requires calculated measure, which needs to be written in DAX. Every BI application requires advanced data transformations which need to be handled with Power Query M scripting language. Designing and implementing solutions with Best Practices is always a requirement for reliable BI applications. We designed our Power BI training in a way that delivers advanced content for all components of Power BI, and fortify your team’s knowledge on the product, so they can solve any complex challenge with this tool.</p>
<h2>Myth 3: Power BI is only for Microsoft based environments and platforms.</h2>
<p>Power Query is the core of data extraction in Power BI. Power Query supports wide range of data sources. Not only SQL Server, but also Oracle, MySQL, web service result set, DB2 and many other data source are supported. There is also possibility to connect to many systems such as salesforce. The Visualization component of Power BI is also HTML5 supported, and is available for all mobile devices. Power BI app in AppStore, and Google PlayStore as well as Microsoft AppStore enables dashboards and data visualizations to be available in all environments.</p>
<h2>Myth 4: Power BI is not a powerful and fully functional BI tool, and cannot be compared with other tools in the market.</h2>
<p>In fact the reverse is true. Power BI is such powerful that can be replacement of many other expensive BI tools in the market. We’ve been through scenarios of successful Power BI solutions that have been replacement of Cognos, IBM products, Oracle WB, SAP BO, and so on. Power BI has 5 powerful components that cover main aspects of BI and data analysis system.</p>
<p>In addition there are always possibility to use this as a hybrid approach and save lots of time and money along with great features that are only available in this product.</p>

<h1>What others say about the training and trainer</h1>
<p><strong>Daniel R Tuma, Senior Systems Analyst at Cleveland Metro Schools, Ohio, USA</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I spent probably about two weeks looking for a good Microsoft Power BI class that would cover all of the aspects of the program. I wanted to walk away from the class being able to apply what I learned immediately. Most training companies that I looked into were in a state of flux with Power BI mostly due to the transitions that Power BI itself was going through. Then I stumbled on the RADACAD web site. Reza Rad touted a course that he taught named “Power BI, From Rookie to Rock star.” If the class was indeed an A to Z course, then it was exactly what I was looking for. The class outline seemed to include every topic on my checkoff list plus much more. I decided to give Reza a try.<br />
Reza completely lived up to his hype. He took us through a natural progression of the software, using example after example of how to complete a task. We went through real world scenarios, a bare minimum of two scenarios for each minor topic. I was completely impressed with his Power BI knowledge, understanding and abilities. Any question we came to Reza with was answered completely and with even more examples.<br />
After the class, my goal of immediately applying what I learned was attained. Right away I was able to successfully pull and massage data, create useful reports and post them to dashboards.<br />
I would recommend Radacad Power BI Training without hesitation.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Weir; Independent Consultant, Wellington, New Zealand</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I learned a lot from this course: it gave a great overview of what&#8217;s possible both right from the UI, and what more awaits if you lift the hood and pimp the engine. It’s incredible to see just how much PowerBI and PowerQuery radically simplify what I would otherwise have to do with many, many lines of complicated VBA code. And Reza is a masterful user of this tool.</p>
<p>Note that Reza covers a lot of ground in this course, and it is pretty fast paced. While you can take a laptop and follow along as Reza takes PowerBI/Powerquery through its paces, for the one-day course my recommendation would be to keep that laptop closed, and simply sit back and watch Reza in action, so you can fully concentrate on just how simple this tool is to use in the right hands as well as think about how you might use the tool to your own ends and ask questions along those lines. You can always purchase the video course (if it’s not already included in your course) and step through the material again at your own pace.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Rob Wilby; Independent Consultant, UK</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I must say your “Power BI Essentials” course has been the most comprehensive Power BI course I have found to date and seeing how you work with data especially the little tricks naturally introduced at just the right moments has made this course a pleasure to take.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Martin Catherall – Data Platform MVP, PASS Regional Mentor</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I attended Reza’s Power BI pre-con “From Rookie to Rock star” at SQL Saturday Brisbane in May 2016. I was a complete Power BI novice, having only previously accomplished a few very basic things with Power BI. Reza took the group through all the components that make up environment. He explained how they had evolved and took the group through walk-throughs of each one. Reza was great an answering questions from the audience at the event and going into extra detail if necessary. All-in all, I would say that I’m now a very confident Power BI user after attending Reza’s pre-con.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Dan Cheshire, Senior Project Manager Air New Zealand</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Reza does not just know Power BI like the back of his hand, he is the most commercially aware BI person I know.  He understands that companies work in the real world and that data isn’t always clean and needs manipulation for it to work and be useful.  When Reza worked on our project, nothing phased or flustered him, he always came up with solutions for problems that seemed to me as insurmountable.  Can’t recommend him enough, invest in Reza as he will not only save you a whole heap of time, but he comes up with long lasting and very powerful Power BI solutions for your business.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Sonia Buckley, Data Analyst at Zoom2u, Sydney, Australia</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>We have started to use Microsoft Power BI and whilst Microsoft tutorials are helpful, if you are not used to DAX then it is very difficult to get your head around and there is little other resources that don’t cost an arm and a leg.  I had a call with Reza who made my life so much easier in just under an hour!  Any time spent speaking to Reza will be well worth it – I have saved hours of trying to get my head around our dashboards by getting some very useful tips and explanations on why things are done the DAX way!  Not only that but he is very patient and straight forward.  Highly recommended!</p></blockquote>

<h1>What others say about the training and trainer</h1>
<p><strong><strong>Kenny McMillan, Sports Physiologist / Data Analyst, Frankfurt, Germany:</strong></strong><br />
I attended RADACADs “Advanced Analytics” course recently in Frankfurt in May 2017. Being a regular user of Power BI (with a science background ) the course was extremely helpful in showing me how to incorporate R data visualisations into Power BI dashboards and for introducing me to machine learning using the Microsoft ML Studio. Leila is an excellent and extremely knowledgeable instructor and explained complex data analytical concepts and methodologies in an easy-to-understand manner. I thoroughly recommend this course to anyone who wants to expand their data analytical skills and knowledge.</p>

<h1>Why Power BI Training?</h1>
<p>Power BI is the newest Microsoft BI tool for data mash up, build modelling, and visualize it effectively. It supports mobile devices, it support self-service, and along with its great functionalities, it doesn’t require heavy development or production system.</p>
<h1>Common Myths about Power BI</h1>
<p>There are some myths about Power BI that sometimes prevents people and organization to move towards using this product. We’ve listed some of myths in following. Please note that these are Myths, and they are not right assumptions.</p>
<h2>Myth 1: Power BI is a self-service Excel tool, and isn’t suitable for Enterprise Solutions.</h2>
<p>There are many scenarios that Power BI has been used in enterprise solutions. Power BI features for data mash up (with the very powerful data transformation component: Power Query), and data modelling  based on xVelocity in-memory engine (Power Pivot), and great data visualization components such as Power View and Power Map, along with mobility support of this product, are rarely available in other products. We have designed, implemented and have seem many BI enterprise solutions based on Power BI within very large organizations.</p>
<h2>Myth 2: Power BI is easy to use, and doesn’t require training course.</h2>
<p>Power BI is an easy to use tool, but for basic functions. Every BI application requires calculated measure, which needs to be written in DAX. Every BI application requires advanced data transformations which need to be handled with Power Query M scripting language. Designing and implementing solutions with Best Practices is always a requirement for reliable BI applications. We designed our Power BI training in a way that delivers advanced content for all components of Power BI, and fortify your team’s knowledge on the product, so they can solve any complex challenge with this tool.</p>
<h2>Myth 3: Power BI is only for Microsoft based environments and platforms.</h2>
<p>Power Query is the core of data extraction in Power BI. Power Query supports wide range of data sources. Not only SQL Server, but also Oracle, MySQL, web service result set, DB2 and many other data source are supported. There is also possibility to connect to many systems such as salesforce. The Visualization component of Power BI is also HTML5 supported, and is available for all mobile devices. Power BI app in AppStore, and Google PlayStore as well as Microsoft AppStore enables dashboards and data visualizations to be available in all environments.</p>
<h2>Myth 4: Power BI is not a powerful and fully functional BI tool, and cannot be compared with other tools in the market.</h2>
<p>In fact the reverse is true. Power BI is such powerful that can be replacement of many other expensive BI tools in the market. We’ve been through scenarios of successful Power BI solutions that have been replacement of Cognos, IBM products, Oracle WB, SAP BO, and so on. Power BI has 5 powerful components that cover main aspects of BI and data analysis system.</p>
<p>In addition there are always possibility to use this as a hybrid approach and save lots of time and money along with great features that are only available in this product.</p>

<h1>What others say about the training and trainer</h1>
<p><strong>Daniel R Tuma, Senior Systems Analyst at Cleveland Metro Schools, Ohio, USA</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I spent probably about two weeks looking for a good Microsoft Power BI class that would cover all of the aspects of the program. I wanted to walk away from the class being able to apply what I learned immediately. Most training companies that I looked into were in a state of flux with Power BI mostly due to the transitions that Power BI itself was going through. Then I stumbled on the RADACAD web site. Reza Rad touted a course that he taught named “Power BI, From Rookie to Rock star.” If the class was indeed an A to Z course, then it was exactly what I was looking for. The class outline seemed to include every topic on my checkoff list plus much more. I decided to give Reza a try.<br />
Reza completely lived up to his hype. He took us through a natural progression of the software, using example after example of how to complete a task. We went through real world scenarios, a bare minimum of two scenarios for each minor topic. I was completely impressed with his Power BI knowledge, understanding and abilities. Any question we came to Reza with was answered completely and with even more examples.<br />
After the class, my goal of immediately applying what I learned was attained. Right away I was able to successfully pull and massage data, create useful reports and post them to dashboards.<br />
I would recommend Radacad Power BI Training without hesitation.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Weir; Independent Consultant, Wellington, New Zealand</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I learned a lot from this course: it gave a great overview of what&#8217;s possible both right from the UI, and what more awaits if you lift the hood and pimp the engine. It’s incredible to see just how much PowerBI and PowerQuery radically simplify what I would otherwise have to do with many, many lines of complicated VBA code. And Reza is a masterful user of this tool.</p>
<p>Note that Reza covers a lot of ground in this course, and it is pretty fast paced. While you can take a laptop and follow along as Reza takes PowerBI/Powerquery through its paces, for the one-day course my recommendation would be to keep that laptop closed, and simply sit back and watch Reza in action, so you can fully concentrate on just how simple this tool is to use in the right hands as well as think about how you might use the tool to your own ends and ask questions along those lines. You can always purchase the video course (if it’s not already included in your course) and step through the material again at your own pace.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Rob Wilby; Independent Consultant, UK</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I must say your “Power BI Essentials” course has been the most comprehensive Power BI course I have found to date and seeing how you work with data especially the little tricks naturally introduced at just the right moments has made this course a pleasure to take.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Martin Catherall – Data Platform MVP, PASS Regional Mentor</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I attended Reza’s Power BI pre-con “From Rookie to Rock star” at SQL Saturday Brisbane in May 2016. I was a complete Power BI novice, having only previously accomplished a few very basic things with Power BI. Reza took the group through all the components that make up environment. He explained how they had evolved and took the group through walk-throughs of each one. Reza was great an answering questions from the audience at the event and going into extra detail if necessary. All-in all, I would say that I’m now a very confident Power BI user after attending Reza’s pre-con.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Dan Cheshire, Senior Project Manager Air New Zealand</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Reza does not just know Power BI like the back of his hand, he is the most commercially aware BI person I know.  He understands that companies work in the real world and that data isn’t always clean and needs manipulation for it to work and be useful.  When Reza worked on our project, nothing phased or flustered him, he always came up with solutions for problems that seemed to me as insurmountable.  Can’t recommend him enough, invest in Reza as he will not only save you a whole heap of time, but he comes up with long lasting and very powerful Power BI solutions for your business.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Sonia Buckley, Data Analyst at Zoom2u, Sydney, Australia</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>We have started to use Microsoft Power BI and whilst Microsoft tutorials are helpful, if you are not used to DAX then it is very difficult to get your head around and there is little other resources that don’t cost an arm and a leg.  I had a call with Reza who made my life so much easier in just under an hour!  Any time spent speaking to Reza will be well worth it – I have saved hours of trying to get my head around our dashboards by getting some very useful tips and explanations on why things are done the DAX way!  Not only that but he is very patient and straight forward.  Highly recommended!</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><strong>Kenny McMillan, Sports Physiologist / Data Analyst, Frankfurt, Germany:</strong></strong><br />
I attended RADACADs “Advanced Analytics” course recently in Frankfurt in May 2017. Being a regular user of Power BI (with a science background ) the course was extremely helpful in showing me how to incorporate R data visualisations into Power BI dashboards and for introducing me to machine learning using the Microsoft ML Studio. Leila is an excellent and extremely knowledgeable instructor and explained complex data analytical concepts and methodologies in an easy-to-understand manner. I thoroughly recommend this course to anyone who wants to expand their data analytical skills and knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Martin Catherall (Microsoft Data Platform MVP):</strong></p>
<p>As part of SQL Saturday Auckland 2016 I attended an “Analytics with Power BI and R.” pre-con with Leila. Leila took the class&#8217;s knowledge from rudimentary to competent in a day. We first looked at R, the language and the software. Once these skills were obtained we started to look at Power BI and the integration that it has with R. We worked through a few examples and Leila answered all of the class’s questions and offered to provide supplementary material for some of the more advanced questions. I left the class feeling that my R and Power BI knowledge was at a competent level and ready to dive into some of the more advanced material that Leila provided.</p>

<p>What others say about the training and trainer;</p>
<p><strong>Daniel R Tuma, Senior Systems Analyst at Cleveland Metro Schools, United States</strong></p>
<p>I spent probably about two weeks looking for a good Microsoft Power BI class that would cover all of the aspects of the program. I wanted to walk away from the class being able to apply what I learned immediately. Most training companies that I looked into were in a state of flux with Power BI mostly due to the transitions that Power BI itself was going through. Then I stumbled on the RADACAD web site. Reza Rad touted a course that he taught named “Power BI, From Rookie to Rock star.” If the class was indeed an A to Z course, then it was exactly what I was looking for. The class outline seemed to include every topic on my checkoff list plus much more. I decided to give Reza a try.</p>
<p>Reza completely lived up to his hype. He took us through a natural progression of the software, using example after example of how to complete a task. We went through real world scenarios, a bare minimum of two scenarios for each minor topic. I was completely impressed with his Power BI knowledge, understanding and abilities. Any question we came to Reza with was answered completely and with even more examples.</p>
<p>After the class, my goal of immediately applying what I learned was attained. Right away I was able to successfully pull and massage data, create useful reports and post them to dashboards.</p>
<p>I would recommend Radacad Power BI Training without hesitation.</p>

<p>I learned a lot from this course: it gave a great overview of what&#8217;s possible both right from the UI, and what more awaits if you lift the hood and pimp the engine. It’s incredible to see just how much PowerBI and PowerQuery radically simplify what I would otherwise have to do with many, many lines of complicated VBA code. And Reza is a masterful user of this tool.</p>
<p>Note that Reza covers a lot of ground in this course, and it is pretty fast paced. While you can take a laptop and follow along as Reza takes PowerBI/Powerquery through its paces, for the one-day course my recommendation would be to keep that laptop closed, and simply sit back and watch Reza in action, so you can fully concentrate on just how simple this tool is to use in the right hands as well as think about how you might use the tool to your own ends and ask questions along those lines. You can always purchase the video course (if it’s not already included in your course) and step through the material again at your own pace.</p>

<p>I must say your “Power BI Essentials” course has been the most comprehensive Power BI course I have found to date and seeing how you work with data especially the little tricks naturally introduced at just the right moments has made this course a pleasure to take.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Catherall – Data Platform MVP, PASS Regional Mentor</strong></p>
<p>I attended Reza’s Power BI pre-con “From Rookie to Rock star” at SQL Saturday Brisbane in May 2016. I was a complete Power BI novice, having only previously accomplished a few very basic things with Power BI. Reza took the group through all the components that make up environment. He explained how they had evolved and took the group through walk-throughs of each one. Reza was great an answering questions from the audience at the event and going into extra detail if necessary. All-in all, I would say that I’m now a very confident Power BI user after attending Reza’s pre-con.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Cheshire, Senior Project Manager Air New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>Reza does not just know Power BI like the back of his hand, he is the most commercially aware BI person I know.  He understands that companies work in the real world and that data isn’t always clean and needs manipulation for it to work and be useful.  When Reza worked on our project, nothing phased or flustered him, he always came up with solutions for problems that seemed to me as insurmountable.  Can’t recommend him enough, invest in Reza as he will not only save you a whole heap of time, but he comes up with long lasting and very powerful Power BI solutions for your business.</p>
<p><strong>Sonia Buckley, Data Analyst at Zoom2u, Sydney, Australia</strong></p>
<p>We have started to use Microsoft Power BI and whilst Microsoft tutorials are helpful, if you are not used to DAX then it is very difficult to get your head around and there is little other resources that don’t cost an arm and a leg.  I had a call with Reza who made my life so much easier in just under an hour!  Any time spent speaking to Reza will be well worth it – I have saved hours of trying to get my head around our dashboards by getting some very useful tips and explanations on why things are done the DAX way!  Not only that but he is very patient and straight forward.  Highly recommended!</p>

While you can take a laptop and follow along as Reza takes PowerBI/Powerquery through its paces, for the one-day course my recommendation would be to keep that laptop closed, and simply sit back and watch Reza in action, so you can fully concentrate on just how simple this tool is to use in the right hands as well as think about how you might use the tool to your own ends and ask questions along those lines. You can always purchase the video course (if it’s not already included in your course) and step through the material again at your own pace.</p>

<p>I must say your “Power BI Essentials” course has been the most comprehensive Power BI course I have found to date and seeing how you work with data especially the little tricks naturally introduced at just the right moments has made this course a pleasure to take.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Catherall – Data Platform MVP, PASS Regional Mentor</strong></p>
<p>I attended Reza’s Power BI pre-con “From Rookie to Rock star” at SQL Saturday Brisbane in May 2016. I was a complete Power BI novice, having only previously accomplished a few very basic things with Power BI. Reza took the group through all the components that make up environment. He explained how they had evolved and took the group through walk-throughs of each one. Reza was great an answering questions from the audience at the event and going into extra detail if necessary. All-in all, I would say that I’m now a very confident Power BI user after attending Reza’s pre-con.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Cheshire, Senior Project Manager Air New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>Reza does not just know Power BI like the back of his hand, he is the most commercially aware BI person I know.  He understands that companies work in the real world and that data isn’t always clean and needs manipulation for it to work and be useful.  When Reza worked on our project, nothing phased or flustered him, he always came up with solutions for problems that seemed to me as insurmountable.  Can’t recommend him enough, invest in Reza as he will not only save you a whole heap of time, but he comes up with long lasting and very powerful Power BI solutions for your business.</p>
<p><strong>Sonia Buckley, Data Analyst at Zoom2u, Sydney, Australia</strong></p>
<p>We have started to use Microsoft Power BI and whilst Microsoft tutorials are helpful, if you are not used to DAX then it is very difficult to get your head around and there is little other resources that don’t cost an arm and a leg.  I had a call with Reza who made my life so much easier in just under an hour!  Any time spent speaking to Reza will be well worth it – I have saved hours of trying to get my head around our dashboards by getting some very useful tips and explanations on why things are done the DAX way!  Not only that but he is very patient and straight forward.  Highly recommended!</p>

<h1>What others say about the training and trainer</h1>
<p><strong><strong>Kenny McMillan, Sports Physiologist / Data Analyst, Frankfurt, Germany:</strong></strong><br />
I attended RADACADs “Advanced Analytics” course recently in Frankfurt in May 2017. Being a regular user of Power BI (with a science background ) the course was extremely helpful in showing me how to incorporate R data visualizations into Power BI dashboards and for introducing me to machine learning using the Microsoft ML Studio. Leila is an excellent and extremely knowledgeable instructor and explained complex data analytical concepts and methodologies in an easy-to-understand manner. I thoroughly recommend this course to anyone who wants to expand their data analytical skills and knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Catherall (Microsoft Data Platform MVP):</strong></p>
<p>As part of SQL Saturday Auckland 2016 I attended an “Analytics with Power BI and R.” pre-con with Leila. Leila took the class&#8217;s knowledge from rudimentary to competent in a day. We first looked at R, the language and the software. Once these skills were obtained we started to look at Power BI and the integration that it has with R. We worked through a few examples and Leila answered all of the class’s questions and offered to provide supplementary material for some of the more advanced questions. I left the class feeling that my R and Power BI knowledge was at a competent level and ready to dive into some of the more advanced material that Leila provided.</p>

<p>What others say about the training and trainer;</p>
<p><strong>Daniel R Tuma, Senior Systems Analyst at Cleveland Metro Schools, United States</strong></p>
<p>I spent probably about two weeks looking for a good Microsoft Power BI class that would cover all of the aspects of the program. I wanted to walk away from the class being able to apply what I learned immediately. Most training companies that I looked into were in a state of flux with Power BI mostly due to the transitions that Power BI itself was going through. Then I stumbled on the RADACAD web site. Reza Rad touted a course that he taught named “Power BI, From Rookie to Rock star.” If the class was indeed an A to Z course, then it was exactly what I was looking for. The class outline seemed to include every topic on my checkoff list plus much more. I decided to give Reza a try.</p>
<p>Reza completely lived up to his hype. He took us through a natural progression of the software, using example after example of how to complete a task. We went through real world scenarios, a bare minimum of two scenarios for each minor topic. I was completely impressed with his Power BI knowledge, understanding and abilities. Any question we came to Reza with was answered completely and with even more examples.</p>
<p>After the class, my goal of immediately applying what I learned was attained. Right away I was able to successfully pull and massage data, create useful reports and post them to dashboards.</p>
<p>I would recommend Radacad Power BI Training without hesitation.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Weir; Independent Consultant, Wellington, New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>I learned a lot from this course: it gave a great overview of what&#8217;s possible both right from the UI, and what more awaits if you lift the hood and pimp the engine. It’s incredible to see just how much PowerBI and PowerQuery radically simplify what I would otherwise have to do with many, many lines of complicated VBA code. And Reza is a masterful user of this tool.</p>
<p>Note that Reza covers a lot of ground in this course, and it is pretty fast paced. While you can take a laptop and follow along as Reza takes PowerBI/Powerquery through its paces, for the one-day course my recommendation would be to keep that laptop closed, and simply sit back and watch Reza in action, so you can fully concentrate on just how simple this tool is to use in the right hands as well as think about how you might use the tool to your own ends and ask questions along those lines. You can always purchase the video course (if it’s not already included in your course) and step through the material again at your own pace.</p>

<p>I must say your “Power BI Essentials” course has been the most comprehensive Power BI course I have found to date and seeing how you work with data especially the little tricks naturally introduced at just the right moments has made this course a pleasure to take.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Catherall – Data Platform MVP, PASS Regional Mentor</strong></p>
<p>I attended Reza’s Power BI pre-con “From Rookie to Rock star” at SQL Saturday Brisbane in May 2016. I was a complete Power BI novice, having only previously accomplished a few very basic things with Power BI. Reza took the group through all the components that make up environment. He explained how they had evolved and took the group through walk-throughs of each one. Reza was great an answering questions from the audience at the event and going into extra detail if necessary. All-in all, I would say that I’m now a very confident Power BI user after attending Reza’s pre-con.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Cheshire, Senior Project Manager Air New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>Reza does not just know Power BI like the back of his hand, he is the most commercially aware BI person I know.  He understands that companies work in the real world and that data isn’t always clean and needs manipulation for it to work and be useful.  When Reza worked on our project, nothing phased or flustered him, he always came up with solutions for problems that seemed to me as insurmountable.  Can’t recommend him enough, invest in Reza as he will not only save you a whole heap of time, but he comes up with long lasting and very powerful Power BI solutions for your business.</p>
<p><strong>Sonia Buckley, Data Analyst at Zoom2u, Sydney, Australia</strong></p>
<p>We have started to use Microsoft Power BI and whilst Microsoft tutorials are helpful, if you are not used to DAX then it is very difficult to get your head around and there is little other resources that don’t cost an arm and a leg.  I had a call with Reza who made my life so much easier in just under an hour!  Any time spent speaking to Reza will be well worth it – I have saved hours of trying to get my head around our dashboards by getting some very useful tips and explanations on why things are done the DAX way!  Not only that but he is very patient and straight forward.  Highly recommended!</p>

I was a complete Power BI novice, having only previously accomplished a few very basic things with Power BI. Reza took the group through all the components that make up environment. He explained how they had evolved and took the group through walk-throughs of each one. Reza was great an answering questions from the audience at the event and going into extra detail if necessary. All-in all, I would say that I’m now a very confident Power BI user after attending Reza’s pre-con.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Cheshire, Senior Project Manager Air New Zealand</strong></p>
<p>Reza does not just know Power BI like the back of his hand, he is the most commercially aware BI person I know.  He understands that companies work in the real world and that data isn’t always clean and needs manipulation for it to work and be useful.  When Reza worked on our project, nothing phased or flustered him, he always came up with solutions for problems that seemed to me as insurmountable.  Can’t recommend him enough, invest in Reza as he will not only save you a whole heap of time, but he comes up with long lasting and very powerful Power BI solutions for your business.</p>
<p><strong>Sonia Buckley, Data Analyst at Zoom2u, Sydney, Australia</strong></p>
<p>We have started to use Microsoft Power BI and whilst Microsoft tutorials are helpful, if you are not used to DAX then it is very difficult to get your head around and there is little other resources that don’t cost an arm and a leg.  I had a call with Reza who made my life so much easier in just under an hour!  Any time spent speaking to Reza will be well worth it – I have saved hours of trying to get my head around our dashboards by getting some very useful tips and explanations on why things are done the DAX way!  Not only that but he is very patient and straight forward.  Highly recommended!</p>

<h1>Why Power BI Training?</h1>
<p>Power BI is the newest Microsoft BI tool for data mash up, build modelling, and visualize it effectively. It supports mobile devices, it support self-service, and along with its great functionalities, it doesn’t require heavy development or production system.</p>
<h1>Common Myths about Power BI</h1>
<p>There are some myths about Power BI that sometimes prevents people and organization to move towards using this product. We’ve listed some of myths in following. Please note that these are Myths, and they are not right assumptions.</p>
<h2>Myth 1: Power BI is a self-service Excel tool, and isn’t suitable for Enterprise Solutions.</h2>
<p>There are many scenarios that Power BI has been used in enterprise solutions. Power BI features for data mash up (with the very powerful data transformation component: Power Query), and data modelling  based on xVelocity in-memory engine (Power Pivot), and great data visualization components such as Power View and Power Map, along with mobility support of this product, are rarely available in other products. We have designed, implemented and have seem many BI enterprise solutions based on Power BI within very large organizations.</p>
<h2>Myth 2: Power BI is easy to use, and doesn’t require training course.</h2>
<p>Power BI is an easy to use tool, but for basic functions. Every BI application requires calculated measure, which needs to be written in DAX. Every BI application requires advanced data transformations which need to be handled with Power Query M scripting language. Designing and implementing solutions with Best Practices is always a requirement for reliable BI applications. We designed our Power BI training in a way that delivers advanced content for all components of Power BI, and fortify your team’s knowledge on the product, so they can solve any complex challenge with this tool.</p>
<h2>Myth 3: Power BI is only for Microsoft based environments and platforms.</h2>
<p>Power Query is the core of data extraction in Power BI. Power Query supports wide range of data sources. Not only SQL Server, but also Oracle, MySQL, web service result set, DB2 and many other data source are supported. There is also possibility to connect to many systems such as salesforce. The Visualization component of Power BI is also HTML5 supported, and is available for all mobile devices. Power BI app in AppStore, and Google PlayStore as well as Microsoft AppStore enables dashboards and data visualizations to be available in all environments.</p>
<h2>Myth 4: Power BI is not a powerful and fully functional BI tool, and cannot be compared with other tools in the market.</h2>
<p>In fact the reverse is true. Power BI is such powerful that can be replacement of many other expensive BI tools in the market. We’ve been through scenarios of successful Power BI solutions that have been replacement of Cognos, IBM products, Oracle WB, SAP BO, and so on. Power BI has 5 powerful components that cover main aspects of BI and data analysis system.</p>
<p>In addition there are always possibility to use this as a hybrid approach and save lots of time and money along with great features that are only available in this product.</p>

<h1>What others say about the training and trainer</h1>
<p><strong>Daniel R Tuma, Senior Systems Analyst at Cleveland Metro Schools, Ohio, USA</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I spent probably about two weeks looking for a good Microsoft Power BI class that would cover all of the aspects of the program. I wanted to walk away from the class being able to apply what I learned immediately. Most training companies that I looked into were in a state of flux with Power BI mostly due to the transitions that Power BI itself was going through. Then I stumbled on the RADACAD web site. Reza Rad touted a course that he taught named “Power BI, From Rookie to Rock star.” If the class was indeed an A to Z course, then it was exactly what I was looking for. The class outline seemed to include every topic on my checkoff list plus much more. I decided to give Reza a try.<br />
Reza completely lived up to his hype. He took us through a natural progression of the software, using example after example of how to complete a task. We went through real world scenarios, a bare minimum of two scenarios for each minor topic. I was completely impressed with his Power BI knowledge, understanding and abilities. Any question we came to Reza with was answered completely and with even more examples.<br />
After the class, my goal of immediately applying what I learned was attained. Right away I was able to successfully pull and massage data, create useful reports and post them to dashboards.<br />
I would recommend Radacad Power BI Training without hesitation.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Weir; Independent Consultant, Wellington, New Zealand</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I learned a lot from this course: it gave a great overview of what&#8217;s possible both right from the UI, and what more awaits if you lift the hood and pimp the engine. It’s incredible to see just how much PowerBI and PowerQuery radically simplify what I would otherwise have to do with many, many lines of complicated VBA code. And Reza is a masterful user of this tool.</p>
<p>Note that Reza covers a lot of ground in this course, and it is pretty fast paced. While you can take a laptop and follow along as Reza takes PowerBI/Powerquery through its paces, for the one-day course my recommendation would be to keep that laptop closed, and simply sit back and watch Reza in action, so you can fully concentrate on just how simple this tool is to use in the right hands as well as think about how you might use the tool to your own ends and ask questions along those lines. You can always purchase the video course (if it’s not already included in your course) and step through the material again at your own pace.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Rob Wilby; Independent Consultant, UK</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I must say your “Power BI Essentials” course has been the most comprehensive Power BI course I have found to date and seeing how you work with data especially the little tricks naturally introduced at just the right moments has made this course a pleasure to take.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Martin Catherall – Data Platform MVP, PASS Regional Mentor</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I attended Reza’s Power BI pre-con “From Rookie to Rock star” at SQL Saturday Brisbane in May 2016. I was a complete Power BI novice, having only previously accomplished a few very basic things with Power BI. Reza took the group through all the components that make up environment. He explained how they had evolved and took the group through walk-throughs of each one. Reza was great an answering questions from the audience at the event and going into extra detail if necessary. All-in all, I would say that I’m now a very confident Power BI user after attending Reza’s pre-con.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Dan Cheshire, Senior Project Manager Air New Zealand</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Reza does not just know Power BI like the back of his hand, he is the most commercially aware BI person I know.  He understands that companies work in the real world and that data isn’t always clean and needs manipulation for it to work and be useful.  When Reza worked on our project, nothing phased or flustered him, he always came up with solutions for problems that seemed to me as insurmountable.  Can’t recommend him enough, invest in Reza as he will not only save you a whole heap of time, but he comes up with long lasting and very powerful Power BI solutions for your business.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Sonia Buckley, Data Analyst at Zoom2u, Sydney, Australia</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>We have started to use Microsoft Power BI and whilst Microsoft tutorials are helpful, if you are not used to DAX then it is very difficult to get your head around and there is little other resources that don’t cost an arm and a leg.  I had a call with Reza who made my life so much easier in just under an hour!  Any time spent speaking to Reza will be well worth it – I have saved hours of trying to get my head around our dashboards by getting some very useful tips and explanations on why things are done the DAX way!  Not only that but he is very patient and straight forward.  Highly recommended!</p></blockquote>

<h1>What others say about the training and trainer</h1>
<p><strong><strong>Kenny McMillan, Sports Physiologist / Data Analyst, Frankfurt, Germany:</strong></strong><br />
I attended RADACADs “Advanced Analytics” course recently in Frankfurt in May 2017. Being a regular user of Power BI (with a science background ) the course was extremely helpful in showing me how to incorporate R data visualisations into Power BI dashboards and for introducing me to machine learning using the Microsoft ML Studio. Leila is an excellent and extremely knowledgeable instructor and explained complex data analytical concepts and methodologies in an easy-to-understand manner. I thoroughly recommend this course to anyone who wants to expand their data analytical skills and knowledge.</p>
