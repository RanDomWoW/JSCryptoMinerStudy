It is managed by The Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide, London. The Library is the oldest archive of material on the Nazi era and the Holocaust in the world. It is Britain&#8217;s national Holocaust archive, and enjoys an international reputation as a leading centre of research and learning.</p></article></div><div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--5-col mdl-cell--8-col-tablet mdl-cell--4-col-phone second-block-right-content"><article class="large"><header><h5> Advanced content <span class="icon-icons-01 icon"></span></h5></header><p>All of the main learning materials on <em>The</em><em> Holocaust Explained</em> have been designed to be accessible to learners from the age of eleven to thirteen.
