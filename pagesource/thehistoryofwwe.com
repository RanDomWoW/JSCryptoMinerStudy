<P ALIGN=LEFT>&nbsp;<B>March 17, 2018: A special message to our fans</B></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>To those checking out the website, thank you. It's
because of fans like you that this site has grown to what it is
today.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>This project was created back in 2002, long before
social media and the WWE Network and when wrestling rumors and urban
legends were taken at face value. I'd like to think, because of this
work, we've been able to clear up what really happened in an industry
built on myth.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>It's a great time to be a wrestling fan. Even if Raw
and Smackdown aren't your style of wrestling, there's NXT, there's
205 Live, there's a growing UK division. And that's just WWE. For a
fan, it's fantastic. For a guy like me whose job it is to document
these events in (sometimes painful) detail, it's overwhelming.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>This project is called The History of WWE. So, for the
time being, that's where my focus will be. Expect a lot more updates
when it comes to 1976 WWWF and 1983 Crockett, and not so much what
happened last week or even last year.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Will I eventually get to what happened in the WWE in
2016? Absolutely. But with so much new footage coming out on the WWE
Network, and with DVD projects like WWE Unreleased, it's not a
priority right now. There are many holes left to fill in what's
already here on the website; it's not time to expand just yet.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Thanks very much for all your support over the past 16
years. We're not going anywhere.  :)
