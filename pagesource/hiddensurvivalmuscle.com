    <p>Dear Friend,</p>
    <p>You train hard, you eat well…it should be enough to keep you in good health and physically and emotionally strong.</p>
    <p>Yet, there is a danger lurking in our bodies that's not only hidden from us… but which even doctors are failing to identify.</p>
    <p>It affects nearly everybody, no matter how active or sedentary you are, or how old or young you are.</p>
    <p>This problem affects not only our body but our whole well-being.</p>

    <p>… because it's tight hip flexors.</p>
    <p>You see, our hip flexors are the engine through which our body moves. They control balance, our ability to sit, stand, twist, reach, bend, walk and step.</p>
    <p>Everything goes through the hips.</p>
    <p>And when our hip flexors tighten it causes a lot of problems in ordinarily healthy and active people, like us.</p>
    <p>Before I reveal how most people end up having tight hip flexors yet never realize it, let me introduce myself.</p>

      <h2 class="white ucase">The shocking ways<br> that tight hips<br> are holding you back…<br> that you won’t believe</h2>

      <p>Here's the truth: Most people don’t realize the cause of their problems is tight hip flexors.</p>

      <p>The impact the hips had on the whole body never occurred to me until I saw the effect of tight hip flexors had on the health and well-being of my wife after she gave birth.</p>

      <p>It was only then that I truly understood the magnitude of the problem.</p>

      <p>We're not just talking about a bit of soreness; tight hip flexors are the root cause of problems such as:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Nagging joint pains in your legs, lower back or hips</li>
        <li>Walking with discomfort</li>
        <li>Hips locking up</li>
        <li>Bad posture</li>
        <li>Trouble sleeping</li>
        <li>Sluggishness in day to day life</li>
        <li>High Anxiety</li>
        <li>Digestive problems</li>
        <li>Compromised Immune System</li>
        <li>Circulatory issues</li>
        <li>Loss of sexual performance</li>
        <li>Lack of Explosiveness in the gym or sports</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If any of these sound familiar to you, don't worry because you're not alone.</p>

      <p>Tight hip flexors affect nearly everybody, but few realize the impact on your whole body.</p>

      <p>Again, everything flows through the hips.</p>

      <p>Think of the hips as a barometer. The health and flexibility of your hip muscles are an indicator of the strength and health of our whole body.</p>

      <h5 class="ucase">And at the very heart of this is the "hidden" <span class="purple">most powerful</span> survival Muscle. When this muscle is healthy, we are healthy. </h5>

      <img src="http://www.unlockyourhipflexors.com/img/psoas.jpg" width="482" height="646" alt="The Psoas muscle">
    </div>


    <p>Your hips are the bridge between your upper body and lower body. They are at the center of your body's movement.</p>

    <p>Sitting within the well of your hip and lower spine is the psoas major muscle, one of the two muscles that makes up the iliopsoas.</p>

    <p>It’s often called the "mighty" psoas (pronounced so-az) for the many important functions it plays in the movement of your body.</p>

    <p><strong class="yellow">The psoas is the only muscle in the human body connecting the upper body to the lower body.</strong></p>

    <p>The muscle attaches to the vertebrae of the lower spine, moves through the pelvis and connects to a tendon at the top of the femur. <strong>It also attaches to the diaphragm, so it’s connected to your breathing, and upon it sits all the major organs.</strong></p>

    <p>A functioning psoas muscle creates a neutral pelvic alignment, stabilizes the hips, supports the lower spine and abdomen, supports the organs in the pelvic and abdominal cavity and gives you <strong class="yellow">greater mobility and core strength.</strong></p>

    <p>When it functions well, it has the power to…</p>

    <ul class="no-bullet p-margin">
      <li><strong>… help you achieve peak performance day after day after day.</strong></li>

      <li><strong>… rapidly drop ugly body fat that stubbornly clings to your body.</strong></li>

      <li><strong>… train harder, heavier and gain strength faster than you thought possible.</strong></li>

      <li><strong>… hit your peak of sexual health.</strong></li>

      <li><strong>… flood your mind and body with renewed energy and vigor.</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Put simply, this muscle is the core of activity in your body. So, when it's out of balance or if the psoas tightens, there are serious consequences which flow throughout the body.</p>

    <p>And there's one activity, in particular, that's the sworn enemy of your psoas muscle…</p>

    <p>It may be the most harmless activity known to man, but it's also one of the biggest dangers to your health.</p>

    <img src="http://www.unlockyourhipflexors.com/img/sitting-crossed-out.gif" class="aligncenter" alt="Sitting!" width="623" height="186">

    <p>Even if you're the most active of athletes, you may still suffer from a tight psoas due to the amount of time you spend each day planted to a chair.</p>

    <p>Weakness, shortening and tightness develops in the muscle through sitting for extended periods of time, poor sleep posture and even stress and tension.</p>

    <div id="three-killing-ways" class="with-shadow">
      <h5 class="aligncenter ucase red with-pb">Here are 3 ways that sitting is killing your physical and emotional health:</h5>

      <div class="clearfix killing-way">

        <h6 class="ucase no-mt no-mb">Bulging belly syndrome</h6>
        <p class="no-mt"><strong>Wonder why your stomach still sticks out even though you’re hammering the core exercises every day?</strong> It's a common myth that bulging belly is due to weak abdominal muscles. The real cause is likely to be tight psoas muscles, which cause the lower back to curve pushing out the stomach. When the psoas works properly it pulls the abdomen back tucking the tummy in, giving you a strong, flat stomach.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="clearfix killing-way">
        <img src="http://www.unlockyourhipflexors.com/img/stress-response.jpg" width="372" height="350" alt="Stress Response System" class="right with-shadow">
        <h6 class="ucase no-mt no-mb">Fat loss inhibitor </h6>
        <p class="no-mt">As the body's "fight or flight" muscle, your psoas is deeply connected to our natural survival instinct. It instantly tightens in moments of danger to either protect you (in a fetal position) or help you run, fueled by the release of adrenaline. However, if your psoas is constantly tight, <strong>it signals to the body you are in constant danger, leading to overworking of the adrenal glands.</strong> When this happens, your immune system suffers and your body automatically switches into fat storing mode in anticipation of danger. Can’t shift that weight? Blame your hips also known as your <strong>"survival muscle".</strong></p>
      </div>

      <div class="clearfix killing-way">

        <h6 class="ucase no-mt no-mb">Lack of sexual performance </h6>
        <p class="no-mt">Sitting all day causes your hips to become stuck in a forward thrust position. This leads to pulling on the lower back and decreased blood flow and circulation through the hips and to <u>where it matters</u>.</p>

      <h2 class="ucase">What your physician ISN'T telling you…<br>
        and what <em>they</em> &nbsp;don’t know</h2>
      <p>Diagnosing tight hip flexors is tricky.

      <p>If you've seen a therapist or physician, chances are they weren't able to pinpoint the issue.</p>

      <p>Buried so deep within your abdomen, it's no wonder identifying it as the root cause of any of your symptoms is difficult to do.</p>

      <p>It's why tight hip flexors are left undiagnosed and untreated for far too long, as physicians look for a simpler explanation.</p>

      <p><strong class="red">So understand that this it's not your fault.</strong></p>

      <p>However, knowing this hands you the power to finally do something about it before it's too late.</p>

    <p>Knowing you have tight hip flexors is one thing.</p>

    <p>Knowing how to fix your hip flexors is another challenge altogether.</p>

    <p>If you trust so-called experts on Youtube and online, they'll have you believe it's simply a case of holding a few static stretches for a period of time to try and lengthen the muscle.</p>

    <p>Or rolling around with a tennis ball stuck to your hip (as if that will really make any difference).</p>

    <p>It takes more than a tennis ball and foam roller to unlock your hip flexors…and doing it wrong could cause even MORE damage.</p>

    <p>The reason few people manage to fix their hip flexors is simple.</p>

    <p><strong class="yellow">It's really a hard area to reach.</strong></p>

    <p>If you see how the psoas is attached within your body, it's buried deep inside your core making it tough to access. It's a hard muscle to find, let alone train.</p>

    </div>


    <p class="with-mt">So it's little wonder why trying to loosen it requires more than a simple static hip flexor stretch like the one below you've probably tried before.</p>

    <p>You've probably found you're spending (or wasting) hours of your time stretching this way only to find it's having minimal effect.</p>

    <p>That's because you need to attack the muscle from a variety of angles using a variety of exercise techniques and modalities in order to "unpack" the muscle in the right way.</p>

    <p>The truth is, you can learn to release your tight hip flexors on your own.</p>

    <p>If you think of your psoas as a combination safe lock, there are several numbers that will unlock it but they need to be entered in the right order.</p>

    <p>There are a number of specific movements beyond simple static stretching you can use to unlock and loosen your hips, legs and back.</p>

    <h3 class="aligncenter ucase">Loosening Your Hip Flexors Can Actually Be Easy<br>
      With the <u class="red">SEQUENTIAL FLOW Method</u></h3>

    <p>Like unfolding a sheet or unpacking a parcel, opening up the muscles in your hips requires it to be done in the right order.</p>

    <p>Try to release one muscle before another and you'll add to your tightness. Getting it wrong really can make it worse.</p>

    <p>It's why so many people give up trying to fix the problem themselves and believe incorrectly that they have to live with the problem. But hoping the problem will go away by not exercising is just as damaging.</p>

    <p>To explain in more detail about this flow, let me introduce you to leading Kinesiologist and Injury Specialist Rick Kaselj, MS.</p>

    <p>Rick is "THE" guy fitness professionals go to when they want to learn about the latest techniques to help their own clients. He's given over 352 live presentations to more than 8,152 health professionals in the US and Canada.</p>

    <img src="img/rick-kaselj-featured-in.jpg" width="970" height="461" alt="Rick Kaselj" class="aligncenter">

    <p>I first met Rick when he helped me fix a shoulder problem. He was one of the few injury specialists I met who helped athletes by focusing on getting them back to training, rather than avoiding workouts.</p>

    <p>Rick showed me what so many other injury specialists hadn't - how to work through the right sequence of techniques to unlock the tension and tightness in my muscles to properly solve the problem.</p>

    <div class="rotate-wrapper right">
      <img src="http://www.unlockyourhipflexors.com/img/Courtney.jpg" width="308" height="402" alt="Courtney and Lincoln" class="clockwise with-shadow">
    </div>
    <p>He's the guy I turned to when my wife, Courtney, was struggling with pain and discomfort in her hips after the birth of our son Lincoln.</p>

    <p>In the days and months following the birth, she experienced pain in her legs and discomfort when walking and sitting. She was struggling to sleep.</p>

    <p>In just 15 minutes working with Rick, he'd successfully unlocked her hip flexors so she no longer felt any pain or discomfort that day. She was able to walk without experiencing the nagging pain in her pelvic area. She could sleep better and could start enjoying those precious days with a little one at home.</p>

    <p>But Rick's "flow" technique doesn’t only help those in pain.</p>

    <p>At Critical Bench, our Head Strength Coach Chris Wilson felt his hip flexors were a little tight (from sitting and answering training questions on facebook too much) and tried the same routine Rick had used with my wife. Within days, Chris successfully increased his deadlift by 35 pounds to finally hit that 500 pound pull he had been training for.  All because he got to experience the sequential flow of movements that Rick developed to release his hip flexors.

    <p>It’s not about the exercises.</p>

    <div class="red-box">
      <p class="red no-mt ucase aligncenter">The power of Rick's technique lies not only in what techniques are performed and how well, but in doing these in the <u>proper</u> sequence.</p>
      <p class="no-mb ucase aligncenter">Done effectively, the sequential flow works with your body to<br> activate its natural healing process, improve flexibility<br> while adding strength and vitality.</p>

    <p>While many of the techniques were ones I already knew, doing the movements in the right order <strong>unravels all the tissues including muscle, fascia, connective tissue, and the joint capsule while breaking up scar tissue.</strong></p>

    <p>Using the right sequence <strong>kick starts an increase in blood flow to the area to clean out metabolites and lactic acid and reduces inflammation while nourishing and rejuvenating the area.</strong></p>

    <p>I've seen, with my own eyes, the power of Rick's techniques on my wife and our Head Strength Coach Chris Wilson.

    <p>That's why I asked Rick to share with you the very same program so you too can help to unlock your hip flexors and gain all the benefits.</p>

    <p class="aligncenter">Working with Rick, we've created a great program that is quite simply Done-For-You.</p>

    <img src="http://www.unlockyourhipflexors.com/img/Unlock-Your-Hip-Flexors.jpg" width="880" height="607" alt="Unlck your hip flexors" class="aligncenter">
    <p>Rick has pulled together a "sequential flow" designed just for you composed of 10 carefully selected exercises, including PNF Stretching, Static Stretching, Dynamic Stretching, 3-Dimensional Core Stability Exercises, Mobility Exercises, Fascia Stretching and Muscle Activation.</p>

      <h4 class="ucase yellow">Unlock Your Hip Flexors DVD Video</h4>

      <p>We've shot these 10 exercises with explanations from Rick on perfect form and exactly how to target that hard-to-reach psoas muscle. The video content is split in two:</p>

      <p>The first is a Coaching Instructional Video where Rick takes you in detail through each exercise, so you fully understand why you're doing that exercise, the best form to take and how it should feel. The second video is a Follow Along format designed so you can perform the flow alongside the video without breaking for explanation.</p>

      <h4 class="ucase yellow">Unlock Your Hip Flexors Manual</h4>

      <p>You'll receive a highly targeted manual with greater depth about the psoas muscle and the effects of its shortening on your health and well-being. It also includes detailed descriptions of the exact exercise movements with pictures.</p>
    </div>

    <p>You <u>will</u> experience immediate results the very first time you go through the program.</p>

    <p>Only through learning how to do this properly will it enable you to start undoing some of the damage done to your psoas and start helping the body to naturally heal itself.</p>

    <p>But first a warning…this isn't for everyone.</p>

    <p>As you can imagine, this is a hugely technical field. The last thing we wanted was to overload you with too much, so we've done our best to distill the program to the most essential elements so you can experience rapid results.</p>

    <p>I guarantee you'll not find an easier program to pick up and start using as part of your everyday routine or workout.</p>

    <p>And if that wasn't enough, I have an offer for you if you purchase today…</p>

<em class="small">"The Key To A Healthy Back And Perfect Posture"</em></span> </h4>

      <p>First and foremost, if the muscles of the hamstrings are tight, they are more susceptible to tearing.  No matter if you're an elite athlete, stay-at-home-mom or average Joe, a muscle tear in the back of your legs can take months to heal and recover from making life very challenging.</p>

      <p>In today's world, most people make a living from a seated position along with sitting in their car and while at home.  All of that sitting over time increases tightness in the hamstrings.  Having tight hamstrings causes the hips and pelvis to rotate back which flattens the lower back causing lower back pain and poor posture.</p>

      <p>In a more perfect world, everyone would get regular sports massage to help improve the muscle tissue quality of the hamstrings by increasing blood flow but unfortunately for most of us, that isn't always possible.</p>

      <p>However, there is something all people can do by themselves which takes only minutes per day to help improve muscle condition and loosen up those tight hamstrings instantly.  In a matter of minutes, you can begin to reverse the damage to the hamstrings and greatly impact how you feel.</p>

      <p>This super effective routine will not only reduce the likelihood of injury but will also improve performance, correct posture and alleviate pain in the lower back.</p>

      <p>The Unlock Your Hip Flexors program is designed to bring you all the benefits of looser hip flexors with greater strength, power and flexibility.</p>

      <p>But its benefits are multiplied when combined with a holistic diet to naturally alleviate pains, aches, soreness and stiffness by tackling inflammation caused by injury or environmental toxins in our food and water.</p>

      <p>Your diet is one of the major causes of inflammatory responses leading to health deteriorating.</p>

      <p>You can instantly improve your body's response to inflammation by choosing the right foods that work with your body to stimulate your natural healing response.</p>

      <p>The 7-Day Anti-Inflammatory Diet is a Done-For-You nutrition program featuring diet recommendations, meal plans, shopping lists and supplement tips to help your body automatically heal itself.</p>

      <p>In as little as 24 hours, your body will switch on its natural healing process rather than causing pain and inflammation which can lead to many chronic diseases and health problems.</p>

      <p class="title"><strong>Stronger & Faster Than Ever</strong></p>

      <p><em>"Being an athlete all my life and having endured multiple knee surgeries due to blowing out ACL's in both knees, I later started to develop a hip issue in my right hip due to the years of wear and tear. It actually got so bad it was hard for me to perform as an athlete as well as be a productive coach for my clients.</em></p>

      <p><em>After getting an MRI to have it checked out, I realized I had a degenerative arthritic condition in the hip that is not reversible. Surgery was not an option I wanted to go through so I contacted Rick Kaselj to see if he had something for me. When I started to apply the strategies from Unlock Your Hip Flexors it helped me re-balance my pelvis and hip joint to where I couldn't even tell I had an issue anymore.</em></p>

      <p><em>These days I'm stronger and faster than ever and still competing in sports. Rick gave me the ability to perform at my highest level as a coach and regain the athletic ability I had lost over the years from wear and tear. I've been using Rick's strategies for years to help myself manage and recover from injuries as well as countless members of the fitness community. I couldn't recommend this product enough!"</em></p>

      <p><em>"I have known Rick Kaselj since college. Since then I have gone to Chiropractic college and become a Diplomate of the International College of Applied Kinesiology and a Diplomate in Clinical Nutrition. As a result I have come to some important conclusions about how the body works. Hip flexibility, mobility and strength is one of the most important things you can do to keep your overall body healthy. The way we moved thousands of years ago is our natural state, which requires flexible and mobile hips.</em></p>

      <p><em>I was excited to here about Rick Kaselj’s Unlock Your Hip Flexors program and have read the manual and watched the videos. I was very impressed with the content. I implemented the concepts and program into my practice with my clients.</em></p>

      <p><em>Rick has developed a comprehensive system to unlock your hips and restore movement the way it should be. Everyone could benefit from Unlock Your Hip Flexors. The two most important things to live a long healthy live is good quality whole food and great movement and which requires great hip mobility. I cannot recommend this program enough."</em></p>

    <p>It still stuns me to see so many guys working hard in the gym and carrying on as normal. They struggle to understand why they still feel pain, why they're low on energy and why their body isn't responding.</p>

    <p>It ALWAYS comes back to their hips.</p>

    <p>Already thousands have experienced the life changing results from unlocking their hip flexors and to celebrate hitting the quarter of a million mark on our Facebook fan page, we're slashing the price of this program for a very limited time.</p>

    <p><strong>Stop writing checks to your therapist</strong> – you'll no longer have to make those expensive trips to your therapist for them to treat the same old injury or pain over again. By treating the root cause, you'll save a small fortune in treatment bills.</p>

      <p><em>"I came across Rick Kaselj a few years back when I was looking for something to help with my painful piriformis syndrome pain which I had been suffering with for over a year. I watch one of his YouTube videos and the advice he gave in the video helped get rid of my piriformis and hip pain. Ever since then I have been following Rick on a daily basis with YouTube videos, blog posts and articles.</em></p>

      <p><em>When I heard Rick was working on a new program to help unlock your hips, I asked him if I could buy a copy in advance. I have been going through the videos and manual in the Unlock Your Hip Flexors program over the last few weeks. The short yet efficient sequence that Rick put together has helped loosen up my hips, decrease back tightness and allowed me to workout even harder. After getting such great benefit from the program, I have also started giving it to my clients and they have reported similar benefits.</em></p>

      <p><em>Thanks for everything you do Rick and I know if you have a stiff, tight or painful hip then Unlock Your Hip Flexors will help you."</em></p>

      <p><em>"If you are an athlete that relies on explosiveness in your sport than you must be aware of the #1 road block in your performance... tight hip flexors.</em></p>

      <p><em>It's the hidden killer of success. Athletes that sit all day for their day job are causing terrible alignment in their hips... which wreaks havoc on other areas of their body. Improving the mobility in your hips will give you the extra edge over the competition and improve the effectiveness of your workouts.</em></p>

      <p><em>"I’ve had so many personal training clients come and see me over the years that can’t squat properly, it drives me mad! This is mostly due to their hip mobility or lack of it! If you sit all day, have hips that are stiff, suffer from mysterious hip aches or struggle to do a perfect squat, then  you need to check out Rick Kaselj and his Unlock Your Hip Flexors program.</em></p>

      <p><em>In my experience tight hips, ache hips and poor squatting if not addressed will lead to more serious injuries and pain further down the line, which is why I whole heartedly recommend Rick’s Unlock Your Hip Flexors program. Get it!"</em></p>

    <h2 class="purple aligncenter ucase">FAQs About Unlock Your Hip Flexors</h2>
    <p><strong class="purple">Q:  How is this different from other hip flexibility programs?</strong></p>

    <p>A:  What makes Rick's program unique is knowing how to unravel the tricky layers of tension with the very difficult psoas muscle in order to effectively loosen and train it.</p>

    <p>Rick's one-of-a-kind sequential flow is your surest path to looser, stronger and healthier hips.</p>

    <p><strong class="purple">Q:  Why are you selling this so cheap? What's the catch?</strong></p>

    <p>A:  There is none. We're so pleased with the number of our customers who have made the investment in this program and have enjoyed life-changing results.</p>

    <p>Our aim is to make this available to as many guys as possible, firstly to welcome more people to our CriticalBench.com audience and secondly because we're celebrating hitting a quarter million fans on Facebook.</p>

    <p><strong class="purple">Q:  How long will it take me to do the program?</strong></p>

    <p>A:  The program is designed to take between 10-15 minutes in total to complete.</p>

    <p>We recommended adding the program as a daily practice to get the best results over a longer period of time. You may wish to add this program before or after your regular gym session or use it independently.</p>

    <p><strong class="purple">Q:  How long until I see results?</strong></p>

    <p>A:  Although everyone is different and results may vary, we know from experience how quickly it's possible to feel and see a difference.</p>

    <p>For some it may be as soon as their first session; for others it may take a few sessions to really start seeing the benefits. Again, it depends on the body in question.</p>

    <p><strong class="purple">Q:  Who is this program suitable for?</strong></p>

    <p>A:  This program is suitable for you if you're currently suffering from inexplicable back, hip or joint pain.</p>

    <p>The exercises themselves are not strenuous and are designed to be carried out by anyone, regardless of ability.</p>

    <p><strong class="purple">Q:  Can I perform the Sequential Flow if I have had a hip replacement?</strong></p>

    <p>A: The answer to this is very individual. It depends on what type of hip replacement surgery you had and how you have recovered from it the surgery. It is best to ask your surgeon or doctor to see which exercises of the sequential flow you should do or avoid.</p>


    <p><strong class="purple">Q:  I want to start right away.  Do I have to wait for the book and videos to come in the mail?</strong></p>

    <p>A: You don’t have to wait, you can have access in just a few moments. Unlock Your Hip Flexors is a digital product so don’t worry about shipping fees or delaying results.</p>

    <p><strong class="purple">Q:  Are the exercises hard to perform?</strong></p>

    <p>A: Nope. Once you watch the coaching videos they will be easy for you.  There are also progressions to make the movements more challenging if needed.</p>

    <p><strong class="purple">Q: What if the routine doesn’t work for me?</strong></p>

    <p>A: It will work. But to make you feel better, if for any reason you're not happy you’ll get a full refund, no questions asked. We stand behind this product 110% and have no problem offering a money back guarantee.</p>

    <p><strong class="purple">Q:  Do I need a gym membership or any special equipment?</strong></p>

    <p>A:  No.  You can do this routine anywhere in a very small space. All you need is a wall to lean on for support for a couple of the movements.</p>
