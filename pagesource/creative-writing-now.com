<h1><b><span style="font-size:16.0pt;">Online Creative Writing Courses, Ideas, and Inspiration<br/></span></b></h1>
Welcome to CWN, where you'll find <strong>creative writing courses</strong>, <strong>ideas</strong>, <strong>prompts</strong>, <strong>free online classes</strong>, and <strong>step-by-step guides to writing</strong> fiction, poetry, and drama.<br><br>

CWN was created by writing teachers as a free service to provide a supportive and friendly place for authors and poets at all stages in their writing lives. <br><br>


<div class="CalloutBox" style="box-sizing: border-box"><h4 style="text-align: left">&#xa0;Free Fiction Writing Course: ENDLESS STORY IDEAS</h4>
<p><a style="font-size: 13px;background-color: rgb(240, 240, 240);" href="https://www.creative-writing-now.com/free-online-writing-courses.html">This free 3-day online writing course</a><span style="font-size: 13px;background-color: rgb(240, 240, 240);">&#xa0;will show you how to find new creative writing ideas whenever you need them.</span><br/></p>

<br>

Need some motivation to get started?  Here are five good reasons to write:<br> 

<h4>Write...</h4>

<h4>1) to express yourself.</h4>

Share the best of yourself.  Cut through the small talk and the chatter to what's important; express the secret feelings and perceptions that don't fit into polite conversation.  Show your personal vision of the world, which is unique.<br> 

<h4>2) to entertain yourself.</h4>

Writing is a challenge, an adventure.  When you're in the thick of it, you can feel thoroughly absorbed.  Write to add color, excitement, and meaning to your days.<br> 

<h4>3) to keep yourself company.</h4>


You never have to feel lonely as long as you can write.  Writing is a conversation -- with yourself, with your future reader, with the books that have inspired you.  You can also create characters who come alive in your imagination.<br> 

<h4>4) to live other lives.</h4>

In real life, there are limits.  In your writing, you can be anyone or anything.  You can try on different lives, become a different person for a while, transport yourself to another place or time.<br> 

<h4>5) to touch other people.</h4>

Offer your writing as a gift to others.  Your writing can move people, make them feel intense emotions, keep them up all night passionately turning pages.  You can create characters to keep them company.  You can make their lives richer and more beautiful.

<p style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #d0d0d0; padding-bottom: 12px;"><em> "I have searched the web and used different worksheets, but none have come close to your worksheets and descriptions of (what to do and what not to do). Both courses I have taken have with Creative Writing Now have been amazing. Each time I have learned something new. The one thing I love, you take everything apart and give examples."<br>
- Katlen Skye</em></p>
<p style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #d0d0d0; padding-bottom: 12px;"><em> "As usual - I already love the course on Irresistible Fiction, rewriting a lot and improving greatly even after the first lesson.  Thanks so much for the great courses."<br>
- Kitty Safken</em></p>

<p style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #d0d0d0; padding-bottom: 12px;"><em> "I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the lessons and feel they were very helpful in introducing new ideas and perspectives to my writing.

- Kayode</em></p>

<p style="border-bottom: 0px dotted #d0d0d0; padding-bottom: 12px;"><em> "Thank you so much for putting together this writing course.  It was of good value to me as it got me started thinking more deeply about my characters.  I don't have a lot of time to write, working two jobs, but I am doing the ten-minute exercise with each lesson, and each evening, trying to get in the habit of sitting myself down to write... I would recommend the course to anyone."<br>
