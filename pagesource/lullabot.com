After graduating with a degree in music performance, he decided in 2004 to start a record label and began searching for tools to help him build websites for the bands he was working with. A recommendation from a fellow nerd landed him on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.drupal.org\">Drupal homepage\u003c/a>. Drupal 4.5 was the current release at the time, and while he got a lot for free from the community, he soon found that he had quite a bit to learn in order to be able to build the simple yet unique websites his musicians wanted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Thankfully, James took to PHP and web development quickly. As his skills increased and interest grew, he began learning other technologies, and built one of the first \u003ca href=\"https://www.lullabot.com/podcasts/drupalizeme-podcast/decoupling-drupal\">decoupled Drupal\u003c/a> websites using a Drupal 5 backend that fed XML to a Flash frontend website. It wasn't long before James realized that he was receiving more compliments on the websites he was building than for the music, and so he hung up his record label hat and began to pursue a full time career in Drupal development.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Since then, it has been a continual growth journey for James. After working as the Drupal developer for Sprocket, a web design agency based in metro Atlanta, he was hired as a part-time Drupal trainer for Lullabot, then as a developer, senior developer, and then architect—all for some of the world's biggest brands. James has worked on large data migrations for \u003ca href=\"https://www.grammy.org\">The Recording Academy\u003c/a>, engaging editorial experiences for \u003ca href=\"http://www.msnbc.com\">MSNBC\u003c/a>, and helped create a fast and stable development and deployment process for \u003ca href=\"https://supportforums.cisco.com\">Cisco's Support Forum\u003c/a>. He architected a decoupled user experience for \u003ca href=\"http://www.marthastewart.com\">Martha Stewart\u003c/a>, and a continuous integration and deployment process for \u003ca href=\"https://www.intel.com\">Intel\u003c/a>, which later became \u003ca href=\"https://tugboat.qa\">Tugboat\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>As a development manager, James helps Lullabot hire the best Drupal developers in the world, empowering them to continue bringing \u003ca href=\"/values\">Lullabot's values\u003c/a> to everything they do, and matching their skills up with our client's needs, all while continuing to do development and architecture consulting himself.

After graduating with a degree in music performance, he decided in 2004 to start a record label and began searching for tools to help him build websites for the bands he was working with. A recommendation from a fellow nerd landed him on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.drupal.org\">Drupal homepage\u003c/a>. Drupal 4.5 was the current release at the time, and while he got a lot for free from the community, he soon found that he had quite a bit to learn in order to be able to build the simple yet unique websites his musicians wanted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Thankfully, James took to PHP and web development quickly. As his skills increased and interest grew, he began learning other technologies, and built one of the first \u003ca href=\"https://www.lullabot.com/podcasts/drupalizeme-podcast/decoupling-drupal\">decoupled Drupal\u003c/a> websites using a Drupal 5 backend that fed XML to a Flash frontend website. It wasn't long before James realized that he was receiving more compliments on the websites he was building than for the music, and so he hung up his record label hat and began to pursue a full time career in Drupal development.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Since then, it has been a continual growth journey for James. After working as the Drupal developer for Sprocket, a web design agency based in metro Atlanta, he was hired as a part-time Drupal trainer for Lullabot, then as a developer, senior developer, and then architect—all for some of the world's biggest brands.

I’d been a happy user for many years, but this announcement came along with more than just a significant price increase. CrashPlan removed the option for local computer-to-computer or NAS backups, which is key when doing full restores on a home internet connection. Also, as someone paying month-to-month, they gave me 2 months to migrate to their new service or cancel my account, losing access to my historical cloud backups that may only be 3 or more months old.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>I was pretty unhappy with how they handled the transition, so I started investigating alternative software and services.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>The Table Stakes\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>These are the basics I expect from any backup software today. If any of these were missing, I went on to the next candidate on my list. Surprisingly, this led to us updating our security handbook to remove recommendations for both \u003ca href=\"https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup.html\">Backblaze\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://www.carbonite.com/\">Carbonite\u003c/a> as their encryption support is lacking.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>Backup encryption\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>All backups should be stored with zero-knowledge encryption. In other words, a compromise of the backup storage itself should not disclose any of my data. A backup provider should not require storing any encryption keys, even in escrow.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>Block-level deduplication at the cloud storage level\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>I don’t want to ever pay for the storage of the same data twice. Much of my work involves large archives or duplicate code shared across multiple projects. Local storage is much cheaper, so I’m less concerned about the costs there.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>Block-level deduplication over the network\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>Like all Lullabots, I work from home. That means I’m subject to an asymmetrical internet connection, where my upload bandwidth is significantly slower compared to my download bandwidth. For off-site backup to be effective for me, it must detect previously uploaded blocks and skip uploading them again. Otherwise, the weeks it could take for an initial backup could take months and never finish.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>Backup archive integrity checks\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>Since we’re deduplicating our data, we really want to be sure it doesn't have errors in it. Each backup and its data should have checksums that can be verified.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>Notification of errors and backup status over email\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>The only thing worse than no backups is silent failures of a backup system. Hosted services should monitor clients for backups, and email when they don’t back up for a set period of time. Applications should send emails or show local notifications on errors.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>External drive support\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>I have an external USB hard drive I use for archived document storage.

This could be as simple as Dropbox or Google Drive, or as complex as S3 or SFTP. I ended up using \u003ca href=\"https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html\">Backblaze B2\u003c/a> for all of my cloud storage.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Arq is an incredibly light application, using just a fraction of the system resources that CrashPlan used. CrashPlan would often use close to 1GB of memory for its background service, while Arq uses around 60MB. One license covers both macOS and Windows, which is a nice bonus.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://www.arqbackup.com/documentation/\">See Arq’s documentation\u003c/a> to learn how to set it up. For developers, setting up exclude patterns significantly helps with optimizing backup size and time. I work mostly with PHP and JavaScript, so I ignore \u003ccode>vendor\u003c/code> and \u003ccode>node_modules\u003c/code>. After all, most of the time I’ll be restoring from a local backup, and I can always rebuild those directories as needed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>[image:{\"fid\":\"4603\",\"width\":\"full\",\"border\":false,\"position\":\"\",\"treatment\":\"\"}]\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cbr />\nArq on Windows is clearly not as polished as Arq on macOS. The interface has some odd bugs, but backups and restores seem solid. You can restore macOS backups on Windows and vice-versa, though some metadata and permissions will be lost in the process. I’m not sure I’d use Arq if I worked primarily in Windows. However, it’s good enough that for me it wasn't’ worth the time and money to set up something else.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Arq is missing Linux client support, though it can back up to any NAS over a mount or SFTP connection.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Like many applications in this space, theoretically, the client can corrupt or delete your existing backups. If this is a concern, be sure to set up something like \u003ca href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/lifecycle-configuration-examples.html#lifecycle-config-conceptual-ex7\">Amazon S3’s lifecycle rules\u003c/a> to preserve your backup set for some period of time via server-side controls. This will increase storage costs slightly but also \u003ca href=\"https://www.arqbackup.com/blog/arq-5-8-5-for-mac-fixes-a-bad-bug/\">protects against bugs like this one\u003c/a> that mistakenly deleted backup objects.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>There are \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/4xil77/good_backup_archival_solutions/d6frkrh/\">some complaints\u003c/a> about issues restoring backups. However, it seems like there are complaints about every backup tool. None of my Arq-using colleagues have ever had trouble. Since I’m using different tools for local backups, and my test restores have all worked perfectly, I’m not very concerned. This \u003ca href=\"http://tomsmusings.twsheppard.com/2017/03/10/backup-software-that-doesnt-back-up-by-design/\">post about how Arq blocks backups during verification\u003c/a> is an interesting (if overly ranty) read and may matter if you have a large dataset and a very slow internet connection. For comparison, my backup set is currently around 50 GB and validated in around 30 minutes over my 30/5 cable connection.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>Time Machine for macOS Local Backup\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201250\">Time Machine\u003c/a> is really the only option on MacOS for bare-metal restores. It supports filesystem encryption out of the box, though backups are file level instead of block level. It’s by far the easiest backup system I’ve ever used. Restores can be done through Internet Recovery or through the first-run setup wizard on a new Mac. It’s pretty awesome when you can get a brand-new machine, start a restore, and come back to a complete restore of your old environment, right down to open applications and windows.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3170844/macs/when-backups-go-bad-the-problem-with-using-network-drives-with-time-machine.html\">Time Machine Network backups (even to a Time Capsule) are notoriously unreliable\u003c/a>, so stick with an external hard drive instead. Reading encrypted backups is impossible outside of macOS, so have an alternate backup system in place if you care about cross-OS restores.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>File History Windows Local Backup\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/17143/windows-10-back-up-your-files\">I set up File History for Windows\u003c/a> in Bootcamp and a Windows desktop. File History can back up to an external drive, a network share, or an iSCSI target (since those just show up as additional disks). Network shares do not support encryption with BitLocker, so I set up iSCSI by following this guide. This works perfectly for a desktop that’s always wired in. For Bootcamp on my Mac, I can’t save the backup password securely (because BitLocker doesn’t work with Bootcamp), so I have to remember to enter it on boot and check backups every so often.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Surprisingly, it only backs up part of your user folder by default, so watch for any Application Data folders you want to add to the backup set.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>It looked like \u003ca href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-killing-file-history-windows-10-fall-creators-update\">File History was going to be removed in the Fall Creator’s Update\u003c/a>, but it came back before the final release. Presumably, Microsoft is working on some sort of cloud-backup OneDrive solution for the future. Hopefully, it keeps an option for local backups too.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>Duply + Duplicity for Linux and NAS Cloud Backup\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"http://duply.net/\">Duply\u003c/a> (which uses \u003ca href=\"http://duplicity.nongnu.org/\">duplicity\u003c/a> behind the scenes) is currently the best and most reliable cloud backup system on Linux. In my case, I have an Ubuntu server I use as a NAS. It contains backups of our computers, as well as shared files like our photo library. Locally, it uses \u003ca href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-raid-arrays-with-mdadm-on-ubuntu-16-04\">RAID1\u003c/a> to protect against hardware failure, \u003ca href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lvm\">LVM\u003c/a> to slice volumes, and \u003ca href=\"http://snapper.io/\">btrfs\u003c/a> + \u003ca href=\"http://snapper.io/\">snapper \u003c/a>to guard against accidental deletions and changes. Individual volumes are backed up to Backblaze B2 with Duply as needed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Duplicity has been in active development for over a decade. I like how it uses GPG for encryption. Duplicity is best for archive backups, especially for large static data sets. \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/102\">Pruning old data can be problematic\u003c/a> for Duplicity. For example, my photo library (which is also uploaded to \u003ca href=\"https://photos.google.com/\">Google Photos\u003c/a>) mostly adds new data, with deletions and changes being rare. In this case, the incremental model Duplicity uses isn’t a problem. However, Duplicity would totally fall over backing up a home directory for a workstation, where the data set could significantly change each day. Arq and other backup applications us a “hash backup” strategy, which is roughly similar to how Git stores data.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>I manually added a daily cron job in \u003ccode>/etc/cron.daily/duply\u003c/code> that backs up each data set:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cpre>\n\u003ccode>\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfind /etc/duply -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -exec duply \\{} backup \\;\u003c/code>\u003c/pre>\n\n\u003cp>Note that if you use snapper, duplicity will try to back up the \u003ccode>.snapshots\u003c/code> directory too! Be sure to set up proper \u003ccode>excludes\u003c/code> with duply:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cpre>\n\u003ccode>\n# although called exclude, this file is actually a globbing file list\n# duplicity accepts some globbing patterns, even including ones here\n# here is an example, this incl. only 'dir/bar' except it's subfolder 'foo'\n# - dir/bar/foo\n# + dir/bar\n# - **\n# for more details see duplicity manpage, section File Selection\n# http://duplicity.nongnu.org/duplicity.1.html#sect9\n- **/.cache\n- **/.snapshots\u003c/code>\u003c/pre>\n\n\u003cp>One more note; Duplicity relies on a cache of metadata that is stored in \u003ccode>~/.cache/duplicity\u003c/code>. On Ubuntu, if you run \u003ccode>sudo duplicity\u003c/code>, \u003ccode>$HOME\u003c/code> will be that of your current user account. If you run it with cron or in a root shell with \u003ccode>sudo -i\u003c/code>, it will be \u003ccode>/root\u003c/code>. If a backup is interrupted, and you switch the method you used to elevate to root, backups may start from the beginning again. I suggest always using \u003ccode>sudo -H\u003c/code> to ensure the cache is the same as what cron jobs use.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>About Cloud Storage Pricing\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>All of my finalist backup applications didn't offer any sort of cloud storage. Instead, they support a variety of providers including AWS, Dropbox, and Google Drive. If your backup set is small enough, you may be able to use storage you already get for free. Pricing changes fairly often, \u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQJf4Uzm53bqoQ7A-LcjsCwu4CHMbT8OvNzZlccfHUL2XJGDdgUm6-yCTRGGMK4I7iLFBCWdm_uvcwq/pubchart?oid=1705979141&amp;format=interactive\">but this chart\u003c/a> (\u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tUWBY--NRVy5zNGCOuustsqPMgiOa4l7f6psaf1bVcs/edit?usp=sharing\">and the underlying spreadsheet\u003c/a>) should serve as a rough benchmark between providers.

Arq is considered a hash-backup tool, while Duplicity is an incremental backup tool. Hash backup tools hash blocks and store them (similar to how Git works), while other backup tools use a different model with an initial backup and then a chain of changes (like CVS or Subversion).

It took around 20 minutes to do a local backup of my code and vagrant workspaces (lots of small files, ~12GB) to a local target.

It’s obviously more open than Arq, but not comparable to something like Duplicity. I found it confusing that “repository” in it’s UI is the source of the backup data, and not the destination, unlike every other tool I tested. It intends for all backup clients to use the same destination, meaning that a large file copied between two computers will only be stored once.

Version numbers in software can be somewhat arbitrary, and I’m happy to use pre-release version numbers that have been around for years with good community reports.

Though SVG can be really useful, one downside to implementing them can be the effort it takes to reuse them across a Drupal theme in various \u003ccode>.html.twig\u003c/code> files. SVG markup can be complex due to the number of attributes and, in some cases, there can also be a lot of markup.

In this article we outline a way to reuse icons across template files in a Drupal 8 theme by creating a Twig helper function to reuse the markup.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Implementing a custom Twig custom function is fairly accessible to those comfortable with writing custom Drupal themes, but because of the way Drupal separates functionality between what can be defined in a module and what can be defined in a theme, we will need to create a module to contain our custom Twig function. To get started, create a new directory inside \u003ccode>&lt;drupalroot&gt;/modules/custom\u003c/code> with the following files and directories inside it. For the sake of this article I named the module \u003cem>svgy\u003c/em> and the source is available \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/tlattimore/svgy\">on GitHub\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cpre>\n\u003ccode>svgy\n├── src\n│   └── TwigExtension\n│       └── Svgy.php\n├── svgy.info.yml\n└── svgy.services.yml\u003c/code>\u003c/pre>\n\n\u003cp>One important thing to note here is that we do not actually have a \u003ccode>.module\u003c/code> file in our directory. This is not required by Drupal, and the Twig extension which adds our function will be defined as \u003ca href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/services\">a service\u003c/a> and autoload the \u003ccode>Svgy.php\u003c/code> within the \u003ccode>src/TwigExtension\u003c/code> directory.

We use this template type for two reasons: Twig in Drupal 8 has built-in filtering for security reasons and using \u003ccode>inline_template\u003c/code> allows us to get around that more easily. Since this markup is fairly small and not going to be changed often, we don’t need to create an extra \u003ccode>.html.twig\u003c/code> file to contain our SVG code.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>Implementing the Custom Function In A Theme\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>Now that the custom twig extension for our \u003ccode>icon\u003c/code> function is created, how is this implemented in a theme? An example of the following implemented in a theme can be found \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/tlattimore/bart\">on GitHub\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The first thing you have to do is add an inline SVG to your theme. The icons inside this SVG should have unique \u003ccode>id\u003c/code>s. In most situations it is best to generate this SVG “sprite” using something like \u003ca href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/svgstore\">svgstore\u003c/a> as part of your build process. But to keep today’s example simple, I’ve created a simple SVG with two icons and placed it in a theme at \u003ccode>&lt;themeroot&gt;/images/icons.svg\u003c/code>.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>After the \u003ccode>icons.svg\u003c/code> is in place in the theme you can include it in in the rendered page with the following in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/theming-drupal-8/drupal-8-theme-folder-structure#theme\">themename.theme\u003c/a> file:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cpre>\n\u003ccode>function &lt;theme_name&gt;_preprocess_html(&amp;$variables) {\n  // Get the contents of the SVG sprite.\n  $icons = file_get_contents(\\Drupal::theme()-&gt;getActiveTheme()-&gt;getPath() .

If you haven’t overridden this template in your theme, the icons will get printed out automatically. If you \u003cem>have\u003c/em> overridden \u003ccode>html.html.twig\u003c/code> in your theme—just make sure you are still printing \u003ccode>page_bottom\u003c/code> inside it: (\u003ccode>{{ page_bottom }}\u003c/code> is all you need.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The \u003ccode>.hidden\u003c/code> class that is used in the wrapping \u003ccode>&lt;span&gt;\u003c/code> here is one provided by Drupal 8 core.

Since the individual icons from the SVG will be referenced elsewhere in the page this is the desired outcome.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the example theme \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/tlattimore/bart\">on GitHub\u003c/a>, this results in the following output on the page:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cpre>\n\u003ccode>  &lt;span class=\"hidden\"&gt;&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n  &lt;svg viewBox=\"0 0 130 117\" version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"&gt;\n    &lt;polygon id=\"down-arrow\" fill=\"#50E3C2\" points=\"64.5 117 0 0 129 0\"&gt;&lt;/polygon&gt;\n    &lt;polygon id=\"up-arrow\" fill=\"#50E3C2\" points=\"65.5 0 130 117 1 117\"&gt;&lt;/polygon&gt;\n  &lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\u003c/code>\u003c/pre>\n\n\u003cp>Now that the SVG “sprite” is included on the page we can start referencing the individual icons within our SVG sprite with the custom Twig function. After you have \u003ca href=\"https://drupalize.me/tutorial/clear-drupals-cache?p=2512\">cleared Drupal’s cache registry,\u003c/a> icons can be added with this:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cpre>\n\u003ccode>{{ icon('up-arrow', 'Navigate up') }}\u003c/code>\u003c/pre>\n\n\u003cp>The first argument passed into the function here, \u003ccode>up-arrow\u003c/code>, is used to reference an existing \u003ccode>id\u003c/code> in the SVG example included above. The second argument, \u003ccode>Navigate up the page\u003c/code>, is used as the \u003ccode>title\u003c/code> of the SVG to better describe contents of the element to users navigating with screen readers.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The resulting markup of this implementation of the \u003ccode>icon()\u003c/code> function when rendered in a page looks like:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cpre>\n\u003ccode>  &lt;span class=\"icon__wrapper\"&gt;\n    &lt;svg class=\"icon icon--up-arrow\" role=\"img\" title=\"Navigate up\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"&gt;\n      &lt;use xlink:href=\"#up-arrow\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n    &lt;/svg&gt;\n  &lt;/span&gt;\u003c/code>\u003c/pre>\n\n\u003cp>As you can see, the resulting markup is much larger than just the single line where we used the \u003ccode>icon()\u003c/code> Twig function. This makes it a lot cleaner to reuse icons throughout our \u003ccode>.html.twig\u003c/code> files. In addition to making templates easier to read and not having to remember all the necessary \u003ccode>&lt;svg&gt;\u003c/code> attributes, we also ensure consistency in how icons get included throughout the project.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>As Drupal themers, it is great to have flexibility like this provided by Twig.

Someone mentioned how easy it was for them to get started by running \u003ccode>yarn serve\u003c/code> in a React project, and I was curious how close to that we could get for Drupal.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>To make this a fair comparison, I’m not including managing MySQL databases and the like. Most React apps don’t use a database directly, and if you do need to run backend services locally, the complexity goes way up. In between writing and publishing this article, \u003ca href=\"http://matthewgrasmick.com/compare-php-frameworks\">Stranger in a familiar land: Comparing the novice's first impression of Drupal to other PHP frameworks\u003c/a> was published, which constrained itself to using the Drupal GUI installer. I think this guide shows that we can run Drupal locally in very few steps as long as we don't force ourselves to use a GUI.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>I also wanted to see what the “new laptop” experience was like. I’ve been migrating my macOS setup between computers for nearly 15 years (if only Windows worked as well!), and it’s easy to forget what exactly is built in and what I’ve added over time. So, I installed a fresh copy of High Sierra in VirtualBox to ensure none of my terminal or Homebrew customizations were giving me a leg up.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>Installing Composer\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>We need Composer to install Drush. Change to the drupal directory in the terminal \u003ccode>(cd drupal)\u003c/code>, and \u003ca href=\"https://getcomposer.org/download/\">run the Composer installation instructions\u003c/a> to download composer.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>When composer is done, you will have a \u003ccode>composer.phar\u003c/code> file in your Drupal directory.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>[image:{\"fid\":\"4592\",\"width\":\"medium\",\"border\":false,\"position\":\"\",\"treatment\":\"\"}]\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>Installing Drush and Drupal\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>Drush is what will let us easily run Drupal using the built-in PHP webserver. It’s also required to do the initial site installation. Pull Drush into your Drupal site by running:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003ccode>$ composer require drush/drush\u003c/code>\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This will not only pull in Drush, but it will also install all of the other libraries Drush needs at the same time.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Once Drush is installed, we have to use it to install Drupal. Drupal does have a graphical installer, but Drush won’t run the PHP webserver unless Drupal is already installed. The most important parameter is the database URL, which tells Drupal what database server to use and how to connect to it. We’re going to use SQLite, which is a simple single-file database. We don’t want the database file itself to be accessible from the web server (in case it’s ever exposed to respond to external requests), so we tell Drupal to put the database in a directory above our Drupal document root.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003ccode>$ vendor/bin/drush site-install --db-url=sqlite://../drupal.sqlite\u003c/code>\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>[image:{\"fid\":\"4593\",\"width\":\"medium\",\"border\":false,\"position\":\"\",\"treatment\":\"\"}]\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>When the installation is done, Drush will tell you the administrator password. If you ever forget it, you can reset it by generating a login link with \u003ccode>drush user-login\u003c/code>.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>Running the Drupal Web Server\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>To start the web server, use the \u003ccode>runserver\u003c/code> command:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003ccode>$ vendor/bin/drush runserver\u003c/code>\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>By default, the server will listen on \u003ccode>http://127.0.0.1:8888\u003c/code>. Run \u003ccode>vendor/bin/drush help runserver\u003c/code> to see how to change these and other defaults.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Finally, open that URL in a browser. You should see the Drupal 8 home page and be able to log in with the administrator account shown earlier. Press CTRL-C in the terminal to shut down the web server.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>[image:{\"fid\":\"4594\",\"width\":\"medium\",\"border\":false,\"position\":\"\",\"treatment\":\"\"}]\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The default macOS PHP configuration is pretty good, though it sets a very low limit of 2MB for uploaded files.

You will need to restart the Drush web server after changing this file.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>Bonus: Installing Git and Cloning Drupal\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>I like to use git even for basic testing because I can run git status at any time to see what files I’ve changed or added. I opened the Terminal and ran the git clone command copied from the Drupal project page.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003ccode>$ git clone --branch 8.5.x https://git.drupal.org/project/drupal.git\u003c/code>\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The first run of this command prompts to install the developer tools:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>[image:{\"fid\":\"4595\",\"width\":\"medium\",\"border\":false,\"position\":\"\",\"treatment\":\"\"}]\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>After they install, you need to rerun the git command again (which is accessible by pressing the up arrow on your keyboard).\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>When this initial clone is done, you will have a Drupal 8.5.x checkout in a folder called “drupal,” and you can go back to the earlier steps to install and run Drupal.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>Next Steps\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>Now that you have a running Drupal 8 site, it’s easy to try out contributed modules or \u003ca href=\"https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental\">new experimental modules\u003c/a> without worrying about breaking a real site. It’s easy to run a “clean” instance of Drupal 8 later, by reinstalling the current site with \u003ccode>drush site-install\u003c/code>, or by creating a new Drupal git clone separate from the first one.

They also have to consider their internal users who create and publish content to ensure their CMS actually does the job it was designed to do. This often requires migrating to new platforms that enable new functionality or redesigning a website so that it delivers the deep user experiences consumers expect.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>For better or worse, website redesign combined with CMS re-platforming can be an enormous undertaking. As a result, one of the most common themes we hear during the sales process is the desire to change one major aspect of the site while leaving the others intact. This usually comes in one of two variants: \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cul>\u003cli>“We want to migrate from [CMS A] to [CMS B] but we don’t want to change anything else on the site” (The “Forklift Migration”)\u003c/li>\n\t\u003cli>\"We want to do a site redesign, but we don’t want to change anything on the backend” (The “Lipstick Redesign”)\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n\n\u003cp>With the instability of budgets and increasing pressure to show a return on investment visibly and quickly, it’s easy to understand why clients ask for these types of projects. Restricting scope means a faster turnaround and a smaller budget right? What’s not to love? Unfortunately, these projects rarely work out as planned. In this article, we will examine the problems with this approach and some solutions that may mean more upfront work but will result in a CMS implementation that pays greater dividends in the long term.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>Redesigns Change Content\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>What can appear to be a simple design change can often have an enormous impact on back-end functionality and content structure. For instance, consider the following design change.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>[image:{\"fid\":\"4578\",\"width\":\"medium\",\"border\":false,\"position\":\"\",\"treatment\":\"\"}]\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the example above, the decision was made to begin showing author credits on articles. While this appears to be a simple addition to the design, it has a ripple effect that spreads into every aspect of the system. Some examples:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cul>\u003cli>Content created prior to this will not have an author attached, so either that content will remain un-attributed or those authors will have to be added retroactively.\u003c/li>\n\t\u003cli>Will this just be a text field, or will an actual author entity be created to centralize author information and increase consistency? If the latter, what will this entity look like and what other functions will it have?\u003c/li>\n\t\u003cli>Will this author name be a clickable link which leads to an author profile page? If so, what is the design of that page, what information will it show, and how will that information be gathered?\u003c/li>\n\t\u003cli>Will authors be able to edit their own information in the CMS? If so, what is the process for getting those logins created? What access rights will those authors have? If the CMS is behind a firewall, how will they access it?\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n\n\u003cp>This is just a small portion of the questions that such a small change might evoke, especially when adding items to a design. Another common example is when a site’s navigation is changed as part of a redesign. Once again, depending on the implementation, this can have several side effects.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cul>\u003cli>For sections that are added to the navigation, there will need to be appropriate content added or moved so that clicking on the navigation item doesn't result in no content.\u003c/li>\n\t\u003cli>For sections that are removed, the content associated with those sections will have to be reviewed in order to determine what sections it should move to, or if it should be archived. \u003c/li>\n\t\u003cli>For more complex changes, some combination of the above may need to happen, and the more complex the changes, the more far-reaching the content review behind them.\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n\n\u003cp>An existing design is the embodiment of a million decisions, and changing that design means revisiting many of those decisions and potentially starting up the entire process again. This is why a “lipstick redesign” is rarely successful. If you multiply the seemingly simple design choices described above by 100 or more, you can see that most clients quickly come to realize that a more extensive upgrade is necessary.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>Migrations change design\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>Similarly, migration between CMSes (or between versions of the same CMS) often involves content changes that have an impact on the design. This is because a site’s design is often a careful balance between the look and feel, theming system, and CMS-provided functionality.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>As an example, every CMS has its own layout and theming system, and the capabilities of these systems can be radically different from CMS to CMS. A design optimized for one system’s advantages may be extremely difficult to implement in another. Even if you could build it, it may be difficult to maintain over time because the new CMS isn't built around the same paradigms as the previous ones. In these cases, it is usually cheaper (in both time and money) to adjust the design than to rebuild the needed functionality in the new system. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>[image:{\"fid\":\"4577\",\"width\":\"medium\",\"border\":false,\"position\":\"\",\"treatment\":\"\"}]\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This can even be a problem when doing major upgrades from one version of the same CMS to the next. A theme or module you relied on for layout or theming in Drupal 7 may not be available for Drupal 8, or it may have been deprecated and added to Drupal core. This means that the affected functionality will either have to be replicated to meet the existing design, or the existing design will have to change to work with the new functionality. Either way, there’s work to do.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>If, as we said above, an existing design is like the embodiment of a million decisions, then cloning that design onto a new system means you have answers to all your questions, but they may be suboptimal ones in the new context. Given that, once you open the door to tweaks, you are opening a world of new questions and starting that process again whether you want to or not.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>Functionality happens\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>In addition to the technical issues behind the these projects, there are organizational pressures that are commonly brought to bear as well. In the end, we always find that stakeholders will receive or create pressure to add new functionality on top of the forklift. The reality is that spending real money on a project that results in no functional improvements for end users is a very tough sell in any organization. Even if that approval does come, it very rarely sticks, and once new functionality gets introduced into the middle stages of a project, the impact on schedule and budget are always far greater than if they had simply been accounted for from the start.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Additionally, most re-platforming projects require a significant amount of time to go through planning, architecture, design, and implementation. During that time your business is not at a standstill, it is moving forward and developing new needs every single day. It is unrealistic to think that your entire business can pause while a migration is performed, and this is another reason why new features have a tendency to creep into projects that were originally envisioned to just forklift from one platform to another. New business needs always pop up at the most inconvenient times in projects like this.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In almost all cases, this new functionality will impact the design and content in ways that will return the affected components back to the design/revise/approve stage. This can be extremely time-consuming, as it often takes months or years just to get the initial designs approved in the first place. Additionally, if development has already started, it may need to be redone or adjusted, wasting valuable developer hours and affecting the schedule even more.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>I know what you’re thinking. You’ve got this planned out all the way down the line and everyone has signed off on it. We have heard it a hundred times, and in the end, these plans always fall apart because as everyone sees the time and money being spent, they just can’t resist getting something more out of it than they planned for. When your scope, budget, and schedule are as limited as these projects tend to be, those additions can end up being much more costly than on other projects.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>How to avoid these pitfalls\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>Having shown that these forklift projects don’t always proceed as originally envisioned, what can you do to prepare? Thankfully, there is a lot you can do to avoid these problems. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>\u003cstrong>Get your goals and priorities straight.\u003c/strong>\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>While a project is in planning and development, it is too easy to be swayed into adding or removing features based on an assumed “need” when they don’t actually add a lot of value. If someone comes in with a new idea, ask yourself “How will this help the site achieve its goals? Where does this fit in my priorities?” Sometimes an addition to the site’s functionality can help increase ease of use, other times you may look to give up some design elements that don’t really add value but will increase scope. Always weigh these decisions against your goals and priorities to make sure the functionality you’re building will have the highest possible impact. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>Know your content.\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>Perform a full content inventory before you begin; it’s an essential step in planning your migration. Without a content inventory, you won’t have the answer to questions like “What is the longest article we need to allow for?” or “How are our articles allocated into different topics and tags?” These questions come up all the time in the migration and redesign process, and having the answers at your fingertips can really help move things along. An inventory will also help to highlight content that is miscategorized, unused, or out of date. This allows you to start planning for how to deal with these items early rather than trying to force them to fit somewhere at the last minute.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>Plan for added functionality from the beginning of your project.\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>This is best achieved by bringing all your teams together, discussing priorities, and building a wish list. With this list in hand, you can now have a discussion with potential vendors about what is and isn't doable within budget and schedule constraints. Typically the list will be required items (“We have to migrate from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8”, “We have to refresh the site’s design to make it more modern and mobile-friendly”) as well as additional functionality you’ll want to add as part of that process (“We need to improve the editorial experience around media management”, “We need a better way to organize our content that reflects real-world use cases”). \u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>Work with a vendor that can provide both design and development services\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>Many companies will get their designs done at a standard design firm, then bring those designs to a development agency for their site build. Unfortunately, most design agencies are not well-versed in CMS implementation as a concept, and especially not for the specific quirks that each individual CMS might bring to the table. This often results in designs that are difficult or even impossible to implement. Working with an agency that does both design and development ensures that your new theme can stand up to real-world implementation, and streamlines the inevitable process of tweaking the designs as changes occur throughout the project.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>Be agile and prepare for the unexpected.\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>While everyone wants to know exactly what they’re going to get at the end of a year-long project, the fact is that real life always intrudes at just the wrong moment. This can come in the form of unplanned functionality from higher up the ladder, technical issues that turned out to be more complex than predicted, or even personnel changes within the organization. While there are things you can do to streamline these situations and make them easier (such as choosing a full-service agency as described above) to some extent you just have to embrace the chaos and accept that changes will always be happening, and you need to deal with them and roll with the punches. Working within an agile methodology can help with this, but we find that more often than not the key is more in the state of mind of the stakeholders than it is in any structure that they might apply to the project.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>Conclusion\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>Whether you are embarking on your own “Forklift Migration” or “Lipstick Redesign”, it’s critical to recognize the inherent connection between your front-end design and back-end CMS functionality. Navigating the interplay between the two of these concerns can be tricky, especially in organizations where product and technology are the responsibility of separate teams with discrete management. \u003c/p>\n","format":"filtered_html"},"related_links":[],"topics":["daa475d8-684d-4409-8429-1d878050a255","8c0ba9f5-7654-423c-9bd5-e9dffae660c9","e14a204f-252d-4031-9eaf-e99cc796ee93","9bc23a87-fe88-4869-8120-b91613d000da"],"authors":["793f179f-cfc6-49e2-863f-320e5e6b5316"],"drupal_planet":true,"slug":"the-myth-of-the-forklift-migration-and-the-lipstick-redesign","parent":"b3fe0945-ae8e-4763-b558-0418c3ee33a6","assets":{"4577":{"fid":"4577","uri":"assets/2018-02/screen_shot_2018-02-14_at_12.01.55_pm.png","mime":"image/png","alt":"Migration spreadsheet","caption":"Field mappings for even a straightforward D7 to D8 migration can get complex quickly.","title":""},"4578":{"fid":"4578","uri":"assets/2018-02/author.jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","alt":"Two article screens with a small design tweak","caption":"The small addition of an author name to an article can have wide-ranging consequences.","title":""}},"hero_image":{"fid":"4576","uri":"us_navy_090527-n-8547m-107_construction_electrician_3rd_class_olatunde_lawal_assigned_to_naval_mobile_construction_battalion_nmcb_5_directs_utilitiesman_3rd_class_patrick_krupa_as_he_drives_a_forklift.jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","alt":"Forklift construction","caption":"","title":""},"hero_image_invert":false,"template":"article"},{"_id":"17e7b63e-34a4-4022-aaae-c03f7fa811da","_rev":"2-618f05b42f2db6a5d0aa5b71b6332359","nid":"1681","vid":"3856","vuuid":"14e4b9a8-97d5-4769-9022-a89c51e967b2","type":"article","title":"Installing MailHog for Ubuntu 16.04","published":"1518631451","full_slug":{"articles":35,"installing-mailhog-for-ubuntu-1604":1681},"full_slug_flat":"articles/installing-mailhog-for-ubuntu-1604","legacy_nid":null,"deck":"This article is a follow-up for \"Debugging PHP email with MailHog.\" It documents an alternative way to set up MailHog, a debugging SMTP server, in a way that does not involve Docker.\r\n\r\n","body":{"value":"\u003cp>This article is a follow-up for \u003ca href=\"/articles/debugging-php-email-with-mailhog\">Debugging PHP email with MailHog\u003c/a>.

Great! Time to start prioritizing sites, hiring teams, and planning development and launch schedules.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>The old methods of release planning don’t work anymore\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>Most enterprise IT organizations are used to a “development” cycle followed by a “maintenance” cycle, at which point you start over again and rebuild with a new development cycle. This type of planning (\u003ca href=\"https://www.advomatic.com/blog/avoiding-the-boombust-website-cycle\">which Dave Hansen-Lange called the “boom-bust cycle”\u003c/a>) led to poor user experiences with Drupal 7 sites as they became stale with time and is impossible to use for a Drupal 8 site.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Drupal 8 has a different release cycle compared to previous Drupal releases. For example, \u003ca href=\"https://www.drupal.org/drupal-7-released\">Drupal 7 was released in January 2011\u003c/a>, and ever since has only had bug fixes (with the occasional developer-only feature added). Drupal 5 became unsupported, and Drupal 6 entered it’s last phase of support (until Drupal 8 was released). Product owners of sites big and small found this release process stifling. The web is a very different platform today compared to January 2011—although Drupal 7 is pretty much the same. The slow release cycle also reduced willingness to contribute directly to Drupal. After all, why spend time writing a new feature you can’t use until you migrate to Drupal 8?\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Part of why Drupal 8’s development took the time it did was to allow for a faster release cycle for features. Now, new features are added in point releases (while code compatibility with prior Drupal 8 releases is broadly maintained).\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Furthermore, security updates are only reliable for the latest minor release. After a minor release, such as Drupal 8.4, security issues in the prior minor release (such as Drupal 8.3) will only be patched for a few weeks, if at all.  In other words, to keep your sites secure, you have to be on the latest point release.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Upgrading your site every six months is a cost of using Drupal 8.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>However, it’s not just Drupal that requires more frequent upgrades. Docker, NodeJS, and PHP itself all have more aggressive support schedules than similar software may have had in the past. Here lies the core of release planning: synchronizing all of these release schedules with your business.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>1. Build a schedule of key dates for your business\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>In the publishing industry, tentpole events such as tournaments, live events, or holiday specials drive production deadlines. In addition to tentpole events, identify conferences, retreats, and other dates where your team may not be available. If they overlap with an \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-life_(product)\">EOL\u003c/a> of software in your stack, you can try to schedule an upgrade ahead of time.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>There are two reasons to identify these early and socialize them with the rest of the business. First, these are times when you don’t want to schedule maintenance or deployments if you can help it. Second, these key dates are times to be prepared and aware of security release windows. For example, Drupal core security releases are usually on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/1173280\">third Wednesday of the month\u003c/a>. If this overlaps with a high-traffic event, having a plan to deploy and test a security patch before the patch is issued will ensure your site is kept secure, and that technical teams aren’t stressed out during the process.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>2. Build a schedule of your stack and its support windows\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>Too often, we see organizations mandate a specific tool (like Drupal or Docker) without budgeting time and money for recurring, required upgrades. Maintenance often means “respond to bug reports from our team and handle outages,” instead of “incrementally upgrade software to keep it in supported releases.”\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Before development begins, teams should gather a list of all key software used in their expected production stack. Then, go to each software release page, and find out the start and end dates of support for the current and next few releases. Use this to create a Gantt chart of support windows.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Here’s an example of one I created for a client that was deploying Drupal 8, PHP, Nginx, nodejs, Docker, and Ubuntu for their sites. In their case, they weren’t using Ubuntu packages for any of the other software, so they had to track each component directly.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>[image:{\"fid\":\"4551\",\"width\":\"full\",\"border\":false,\"position\":\"\",\"treatment\":\"\"}]\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Having such a chart prevents surprises. For example, if a site is using nodejs 6.x, we can see that it’s going to EOL just after Drupal 8.5 is released. It would make sense for a developer to work on upgrading to nodejs 8.x over the December holiday break so that the team isn’t juggling upgrading two core components at the same time.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This type of chart also gives teams the power to know if a given technology stack is maintainable for their organization. If it’s a small team maintaining a large Drupal site, they may not have the bandwidth or expertise to keep up with updates elsewhere in the stack. That may mean they have to stick with LTS releases, or avoid software without an LTS available.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>For Drupal 8, that may mean that it is not a fit for your organization. If your budget only allows an initial build and then very minimal maintenance, Drupal 7 or another CMS may be a better fit (at least until Drupal 8 has an LTS). Or, for event and marketing sites, consider using a static site generator like Jekyll, so that when development ends the site can be “serialized” into static HTML and served with a basic stack using LTS software only.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>3. Have a top-down process for handling security and feature updates\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>Many times we see software update requests coming from the development team, and then bubbling up to product owners and managers, meaning management will often prioritize new features with immediate business value before critical updates. Of course, this ignores the fact that a functioning and secure website is the foundation for addressing the needs of the business. And, it places developers in an awkward position where they are responsible for cleaning up any security breaches that occur.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Instead, software updates should be visible to and scheduled by the project managers, ensuring that time is available in the right sprint to test and deploy updates, preventing the development team from being overcommitted or opening your site up to a security breach. For example, let's say a team is using two-week sprints, with a sprint set to start on February 19, 2018. A quick look at the \u003ca href=\"https://www.drupal.org/core/release-cycle-overview\">release cycle overview for Drupal 8\u003c/a> shows that 8.5.0-rc1 will be tagged on February 21st. Creating a ticket for that sprint ahead of time will ensure the upgrade won’t be forgotten.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>It can be more difficult to handle software—like Drupal contributed modules or npm packages—that doesn't have a defined release schedule. In those cases, having a recurring “update everything” ticket can help. Assuming one team manages an entire deployment, a successful schedule might look like:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cul>\u003cli>Sprint 1: Update all Drupal contributed modules\u003c/li>\n\t\u003cli>Sprint 2: Update all npm packages\u003c/li>\n\t\u003cli>Sprint 3: Update all system-level packages\u003c/li>\n\t\u003cli>Sprint 4: Update all Drupal contributed modules\u003c/li>\n\t\u003cli>… etc.\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n\n\u003cp>Remember, just because you schedule software updates doesn’t mean that you have to deploy them to production if QA goes poorly. But, if you do find issues, at least you can try to address them before, and not during a security patch.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>4. Promote the new features you deploy to your colleagues and users\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>After doing all of this work, you should tell your end users and stakeholders about the gains you’ve made in the process. Show editorial users how \u003ca href=\"https://www.drupal.org/blog/drupal-8-4-0\">Drupal 8.4’s Inline Form Errors\u003c/a> gives them a better display of form errors on content they write. Tell your stakeholders how your API servers respond 15% faster to mobile clients. High-five your developers when they can remove a patch they’d been manually applying to the site.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>For larger teams, newsletters and blogs are a great way to communicate these improvements. They are especially useful for core development teams, who write and maintain software shared throughout an enterprise.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>With a solid grasp of how upstream release schedules affect your product, you will be able to reduce the need for unexpected delays and budget requests.

As \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/DanAtSevaa/status/926843911519252481\">Ryan Szrama put it\u003c/a> , “if you’re not using a dependency manager [like Composer], then \u003cem>you’re\u003c/em> the dependency manager, and you are unreliable.”\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>Where do I start?\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>To begin, it’s good to familiarize yourself with the \u003ca href=\"https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer\">fantastic documentation on Drupal.org\u003c/a> . If you haven’t already, \u003ca href=\"https://getcomposer.org/download/\">install Composer\u003c/a> in your development environment. When getting started, it’s extremely important that your development environment is using the same version of PHP that the target production environment will use. Otherwise Composer may download packages that won’t work in production. (With larger development teams, using something like \u003ca href=\"https://www.lullabot.com/podcasts/drupalizeme-podcast/virtualization-with-vagrant\">Vagrant\u003c/a> or Docker for local development can help ensure compatibility between local development instances and the production stack, but that’s \u003ca href=\"/articles/local-drupal-development-roundup\">a separate topic\u003c/a>).\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>To start with, you need to get Drupal core installed. If you are familiar with using starter-kits like \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Lullabot/drupal-boilerplate\">Drupal Boilerplate\u003c/a> in Drupal 7, there is a Composer template for Drupal projects called, well, \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project\">drupal-project\u003c/a>. It’s the recommended starting place for a Composer-based Drupal 8 installation. Before you create it—again—be sure you are using the production version of PHP. Once you’ve confirmed that, run:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cpre>\n\u003ccode>$ composer create-project drupal-composer/drupal-project:8.x-dev \\\nexample --stability dev --no-interaction\n\u003c/code>\u003c/pre>\n\n\u003cp>This will copy the \u003cem>drupal-project\u003c/em> to the \u003ccode>example\u003c/code> directory, and download Drupal core and some handy packages. This is a good point to \u003ccode>cd\u003c/code> into the example directory, run \u003ccode>git init\u003c/code> , and to then create your initial commit for your project.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This also might be a good time to pop open the composer.json file that was created in there (which should look a lot like \u003ca href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project/8.x/composer.json\">this\u003c/a>). This file serves as your “recipe” for the project.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>How do I download modules and themes?\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>If you are familiar with using \u003ccode>drush dl\u003c/code> in Drupal 7 to download contributed modules and themes, it can be a bit of a shift switching to a Composer workflow. There is a different syntax for selecting the version you’d like, and in some cases it’s best to not commit the actual downloaded files to your repository (more on that to follow).\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>For most instances, you can use \u003ccode>composer require [vendor]/[packagename]\u003c/code> to grab the package you’d like. Most Drupal modules and themes are hosted on a custom Composer \u003ca href=\"https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#repository\">repository\u003c/a>, which \u003cem>drupal-project\u003c/em> configures for us out of the box. That means we can use \u003ccode>drupal\u003c/code> as the vendor to download Drupal modules and themes that are maintained on drupal.org. If you aren’t using \u003cem>drupal-project\u003c/em>, you may need to \u003ca href=\"https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-to-manage-drupal-site-dependencies#drupal-packagist\">add the Drupal.org Composer repository\u003c/a> yourself.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>For example, if you were wanting to download the \u003ca href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/devel\">Devel module\u003c/a>, you would run the following command:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cpre>\n\u003ccode>$ composer require drupal/devel\n\u003c/code>\u003c/pre>\n\n\u003cp>For most cases, that would download the most recent stable version of the Devel module that is compatible with your version of Drupal and PHP. If you used \u003cem>drupal-project\u003c/em> above, it would download the module to \u003ccode>web/modules/contrib\u003c/code>. If you want to change the download destination, you can alter the paths in your composer.json. Look for the \u003ccode>installer-paths\u003c/code> under \u003ccode>extra\u003c/code> and adjust to your liking.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>Development Dependencies\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>The Devel module is a good example to use, as it brings up a few other things to note. For example, since the Devel module shouldn’t be used in a production environment, you may only want it to get downloaded on development environments. With Composer, you can achieve this by passing the \u003ccode>--dev\u003c/code> flag to the \u003ccode>composer require\u003c/code> command.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cpre>\n\u003ccode>$ composer require --dev drupal/devel\n\u003c/code>\u003c/pre>\n\n\u003cp>This will ensure that the Devel module is available for your developers when they run \u003ccode>composer install\u003c/code> , but that it won’t ship with your production release (which should get built using \u003ccode>composer install --no-dev\u003c/code> ). This is just an example, and your project needs may differ, but the use of \u003ccode>--dev\u003c/code> to specify dependencies only needed during development is a recommended best practice.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>As a side note, if you are committing your exported Drupal 8 configuration to code, you may want to use the \u003ca href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/config_split\">Configuration Split\u003c/a> module to ensure that the Devel module’s enabled status doesn’t get pushed to production by mistake in a release.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>Nested Dependencies\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>Another thing to note is that the Devel module ships with its own \u003ccode>composer.json\u003c/code> file. Since we used Composer to download Devel, Composer will also read in Devel’s composer.json and download any dependencies that it may have. In this case (at the time of this writing), Devel doesn’t have any required dependencies, but if you were to use Composer to download, say \u003ca href=\"https://drupal.org/project/address\">Address module\u003c/a>, it would pull in its additional dependencies as well, as Address module uses \u003ca href=\"http://cgit.drupalcode.org/address/tree/composer.json\">Composer to specify some additional dependencies\u003c/a> .\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>Downloading specific versions\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>While it’s most often fine to omit declaring a specific version like we did above, there still may come a time when you need to narrow the range of possibilities a bit to get a package version that is compatible with your application.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Judging by the length of the Composer documentation on \u003ca href=\"https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md\">Versions and constraints\u003c/a>, this is no small topic, and you should definitely read through that page to familiarize yourself with it. For most cases, you’ll want to use the caret constraint (e.g., \u003ccode>composer require drupal/foo:^1.0\u003c/code> means the latest release in the 8.1 branch), but here’s some more details about versions and constraints:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003col>\u003cli>Read up on \u003ca href=\"https://semver.org/\">Semantic Versioning\u003c/a> if you aren’t familiar with it. Basically, versions are in the \u003ccode>x.y.z\u003c/code> format, sometimes described as \u003ccode>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH\u003c/code> , or \u003ccode>BREAKING.FEATURE.FIX\u003c/code> . Fixes increment the last number, new features increment the middle number, and refactors or rewrites that would break existing implementations increment the first number.\u003c/li>\n\t\u003cli>Use a colon after the vendor/package name to specify a version or constraint, e.g. \u003ccode>composer require drupal/foo:1.2.3\u003c/code> (which would require that exact version (1.2.3) of the foo package). If you’re used to drush syntax (\u003ccode>8.x-1.2.3\u003c/code>), the Composer syntax does not include the Drupal version (i.e., there's no \u003ccode>8.x\u003c/code>).\u003c/li>\n\t\u003cli>Don’t specify an exact version unless you have to. It’s better to use a constraint.\u003c/li>\n\t\u003cli>The caret constraint (\u003ccode>^\u003c/code>): this will allow any new versions except \u003ccode>BREAKING\u003c/code> ones—in other words, the first number in the version cannot increase, but the others can. \u003ccode>drupal/foo:^1.0\u003c/code> would allow anything greater than or equal to \u003ccode>1.0\u003c/code> but less than \u003ccode>2.0.x\u003c/code> . If you need to specify a version, this is the recommended method.\u003c/li>\n\t\u003cli>The tilde constraint (\u003ccode>~\u003c/code>): this is a bit more restrictive than the caret constraint. It means composer can download a higher version of \u003cem>the last digit specified\u003c/em> only. For example, \u003ccode>drupal/foo:~1.2\u003c/code> will allow anything greater than or equal to version 1.2 (i.e., 1.2.0, 1.3.0, 1.4.0,…,1.999.999), but it won’t allow that first 1 to increment to a 2.x release. Likewise, \u003ccode>drupal/foo:~1.2.3\u003c/code> will allow anything from 1.2.3 to 1.2.999, but not 1.3.0.\u003c/li>\n\t\u003cli>The other constraints are a little more self-explanatory. You can specify a \u003ca href=\"https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md#version-range\">version range\u003c/a> with operators, a specific stability level (e.g., \u003ccode>-stable\u003c/code> or \u003ccode>-dev\u003c/code> ), or even specify wildcards with \u003ccode>*\u003c/code>.\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ol>\n\n\u003ch2>What do I commit?\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>Now that we’ve got a project started using Composer, the next question you may have is, “What files should I commit to my repository?” The \u003cem>drupal-project\u003c/em> will actually ship a \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project/blob/8.x/.gitignore\">default \u003c/a> \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project/blob/8.x/.gitignore\">\u003ccode>.gitignore\u003c/code>\u003c/a> file that will handle most of this for you. That said, there are a few things that may be of interest to you.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>You may have noticed that after running some of the above commands, Composer created a \u003ccode>composer.lock\u003c/code> file in your repository. \u003cstrong>The \u003c/strong> \u003ccode>composer.lock\u003c/code> \u003cstrong> file is a very important file that you want to commit to your repository anytime it changes.\u003c/strong> When you require a new package, you may have omitted a version or a version constraint, but Composer downloaded a specific version. That exact version is recorded in the composer.lock file, and by committing it to your repository, you then ensure that anytime \u003ccode>composer install\u003c/code> is run on any other environment, the same exact code gets downloaded. That is very important from a project stability standpoint, as otherwise, Composer will download whatever new stable version is around based on what’s in \u003ccode>composer.json\u003c/code>.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Now that we understand more about what \u003ccode>composer.lock\u003c/code> is for, here’s a list of what to commit and what not to commit:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003col>\u003cli>Commit \u003ccode>composer.json\u003c/code> and \u003ccode>composer.lock\u003c/code> anytime they change.\u003c/li>\n\t\u003cli>There’s no need to commit anything in \u003ccode>./vendor\u003c/code> , Drupal core (\u003ccode>.\u003c/code>\u003ccode>/web/core\u003c/code>), or contributed modules and themes (\u003ccode>.\u003c/code>\u003ccode>/web/modules/contrib\u003c/code> or \u003ccode>./web/themes/contrib\u003c/code>). In fact, it’s \u003ca href=\"https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md\">recommended not to\u003c/a>, as that ensures the same code is used on all environments, and reduces the size of diffs. If you really want to (because of how your code gets deployed to production, for example), it is possible, you’ll just need to change the \u003ccode>.gitignore\u003c/code>, and \u003cem>always\u003c/em> make sure the committed versions match the versions in \u003ccode>composer.lock\u003c/code>.\u003c/li>\n\t\u003cli>Commit any other custom code and configuration as usual.\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ol>\n\n\u003ch2>How do I keep things up to date?\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>Updating modules, themes, and libraries downloaded with Composer is similar to installing them. While you can run \u003ccode>composer update\u003c/code> to update all installed packages, it’s best to save that for the beginning of a sprint, and update individual projects as needed after that. This ensures you only update exactly what you need without risking introducing bugs from upstream dependencies. If you aren’t working in sprints, set up a regular time (weekly or monthly) to run \u003ccode>composer update\u003c/code> on the whole project.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>To update the Devel module we installed earlier, you could run:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cpre>\n\u003ccode>$ composer update --with-dependencies drupal/devel\n\u003c/code>\u003c/pre>\n\n\u003cp>You might be wondering what that \u003ccode>--with-dependencies\u003c/code> option is. If you run the update command without it, composer will update just the module, and not any packages required by that module. In most circumstances, it’s best to update the module’s dependencies as well, so get used to using \u003ccode>--with-dependencies\u003c/code>.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>You can also update multiple packages separated by spaces:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cpre>\n\u003ccode>$ composer update --with-dependencies drupal/foo drupal/bar\n\u003c/code>\u003c/pre>\n\n\u003cp>For a more aggressive approach, you can also use wildcards. For example, to update all drupal packages, you could run:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cpre>\n\u003ccode>$ composer update --with-dependencies drupal/*\n\u003c/code>\u003c/pre>\n\n\u003cp>Once complete, be sure to commit the changes to \u003ccode>composer.lock\u003c/code>.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>What about patches?\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>Inevitably, you’ll need to apply some patches to a Drupal module, theme, or possibly Drupal core. Since you aren’t committing the actual patched modules or themes with a Composer workflow, you’ll need some way to apply those patches consistently across all environments when they are downloaded. For this we recommend \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches\">composer-patches\u003c/a>. It uses a self-documenting syntax in \u003ccode>composer.json\u003c/code> to declare your patches. If you’re using \u003cem>drupal-project\u003c/em> mentioned above, \u003cem>composer-patches\u003c/em> will already be installed and ready to use. If not, adding it to your project is as simple as:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cpre>\n\u003ccode>$ composer require cweagans/composer-patches\n\u003c/code>\u003c/pre>\n\n\u003cp>While it’s installing, \u003cstrong>take this time to \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches/blob/master/README.md\">go read the README.md\u003c/a> on GitHub\u003c/strong>.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Once installed, you can patch a package by editing your \u003ccode>composer.json\u003c/code> . Continuing with our example of Devel module, let’s say you wanted to patch Devel with a patch from \u003ca href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/devel/issues/2912102\">this issue\u003c/a>. First step?—copy the path to the patch file you want to use. At the time of this writing, the most recent patch is \u003ccode>https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/2860796-2.patch\u003c/code> .\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Once you have the path to the patch, add the patch to the \u003ccode>extras\u003c/code> section of your composer.json like so:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cpre>\n\u003ccode>\"extra\": {\n  \"patches\": {\n    \"drupal/devel\": {\n      \"2860796: Create a branch of devel compatible with Media in core\": \"https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/2860796-2.patch\"\n    }\n  }\n} \n\u003c/code>\u003c/pre>\n\n\u003cp>You can see that in the above example, we used the node id (\u003ccode>2860796\u003c/code>) and title of the Drupal.org issue as the key, but you may decide to also include the full URL to the issue and comment. It’s unfortunately not the easiest syntax to read, but it works. Consistency is key, so settle on a preferred format and stick to it.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Once the above has been added to composer.json, simply run \u003ccode>composer update drupal/devel\u003c/code> for the patch to get applied.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cpre>\n\u003ccode>$ composer update drupal/devel\nGathering patches for root package.\nRemoving package drupal/devel so that it can be re-installed and re-patched.\nDeleting web/modules/contrib/devel - deleted\n&gt; DrupalProject\\composer\\ScriptHandler::checkComposerVersion\nLoading composer repositories with package information\nUpdating dependencies (including require-dev)\nPackage operations: 1 install, 0 updates, 0 removals\nGathering patches for root package.\nGathering patches for dependencies.

Here’s a quick one-liner for that:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cpre>\n\u003ccode>$ composer config extra.enable-patching true\n\u003c/code>\u003c/pre>\n\n\u003ch2>How do I remove a module or theme?\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>Removing a module or theme using Composer is fairly straightforward. We can use \u003ccode>composer remove\u003c/code> for this:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cpre>\n\u003ccode>$ composer remove drupal/devel\n\u003c/code>\u003c/pre>\n\n\u003cp>If you added \u003ccode>drupal/devel\u003c/code> with the \u003ccode>--dev\u003c/code> flag, you might get a prompt to confirm the removal from \u003ccode>require-dev\u003c/code> . If you want to avoid that prompt, you can use the \u003ccode>--dev\u003c/code> flag in your remove command as well:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cpre>\n\u003ccode>$ composer remove --dev drupal/devel\n\u003c/code>\u003c/pre>\n\n\u003cp>Once it’s done, commit your \u003ccode>composer.json\u003c/code> and \u003ccode>composer.lock\u003c/code> file.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>Anything else to watch out for?\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003ch3>Removing patches\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>If you need to remove a module or theme that has patches, the patches don’t automatically get removed from the \u003ccode>composer.json\u003c/code> file. You can either remove them by hand in your editor, or run:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cpre>\n\u003ccode>$ composer config --unset extra.patches.drupal/devel\n\u003c/code>\u003c/pre>\n\n\u003ch3>Lock hash warnings\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>On a related note, any time you manually edit \u003ccode>composer.json\u003c/code> in this way without a subsequent \u003ccode>composer update\u003c/code>, the hash in \u003ccode>composer.lock\u003c/code> will be out of date, throwing warnings. To fix that without changing the code you have installed, run \u003ccode>composer update --lock\u003c/code>. That will just update the hash in the lock file without updating anything else. Once complete, commit the \u003ccode>composer.json\u003c/code> and \u003ccode>composer.lock\u003c/code>.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>PHP Versions…again\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>As mentioned early on, it’s \u003ca href=\"http://doctrine-project.org/2017/07/25/php-7.1-requirement-and-composer.html#making-sure-you-get-a-compatible-version\">very important\u003c/a> with a Composer-based workflow that the various environments use the same major and minor release of PHP. If you aren’t using Vagrant or Docker for local development and are finding it difficult to standardize, you can \u003ca href=\"https://getcomposer.org/doc/06-config.md#platform\">enforce a specific PHP version\u003c/a> for Composer to adhere to in \u003ccode>composer.json\u003c/code>.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cpre>\n\u003ccode>$ composer config platform.php 7.1\n\u003c/code>\u003c/pre>\n\n\u003cp>Once added, don’t forget to update your lock file and commit the resulting \u003ccode>composer.json\u003c/code> and \u003ccode>composer.lock\u003c/code> .\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cpre>\n\u003ccode>$ composer update --lock\n\u003c/code>\u003c/pre>\n\n\u003ch3>Speeding things up\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>There are some Composer operations that can be slow. To speed things up, you can install \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/hirak/prestissimo\">Prestissimo\u003c/a>, which will allow Composer to run operations in parallel. It’s best to do this globally:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cpre>\n\u003ccode>$ composer global require hirak/prestissimo\n\u003c/code>\u003c/pre>\n\n\u003ch2>It’s not perfect\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>You will inevitably run into some frustrating issues with a Composer workflow that will cause you to question its wisdom. While there may be scenarios where it might make sense to abandon it for other options, you will bear the burden of managing the complexities of your project’s dependencies yourself. If you stick with Composer, the good news for you is that you are not alone, and these issues promise to improve over time because of that. Think of it as an investment in the long-term stability of your project.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://voiceofniagara.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/bpo-fallettacollage.jpg\">\u003cem>Collage of JoAnn Falletta\u003c/em>\u003c/a> by \u003ca href=\"https://www.markdellas.com/\">Mark Dellas\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n","format":"filtered_html"},"related_links":[],"topics":["b624cdd6-66dc-4e1e-9370-be05bf8ef1e3","0c85b4af-2b6f-45cc-b7ee-e2f810a0e3e1","018d74a6-70f1-46d7-82a6-84fdaa20c1ab"],"authors":["7a4aa192-ba4b-469f-a243-be6a6b8cf95b"],"drupal_planet":true,"slug":"drupal-8-composer-best-practices","parent":"b3fe0945-ae8e-4763-b558-0418c3ee33a6","assets":{},"hero_image":{"fid":"4541","uri":"bpo-fallettacollage.jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","alt":"Collage of JoAnn Falletta by Mark Dellas","caption":"Collage of JoAnn Falletta by Mark Dellas","title":""},"hero_image_invert":false,"template":"article"}]},"editLinksActive":false},"podcasts":{"latest":[{"uuid":"42e9a019-5f43-4f53-84e8-7a5be1b9531c","title":"Behind the Screens with Angus Mak","slug":"260-angus-mak","full_slug_flat":"podcasts/drupal-voices/260-angus-mak","deck":"Lullabot's Senior Developer Angus Mak stepped away from Drupal to take on Roku, iOS, and tvOS for clients.
