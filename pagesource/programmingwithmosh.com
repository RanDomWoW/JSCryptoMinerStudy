Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don't need to copy all
your theme's stylesheet content.

<blockquote><p>We don&#8217;t have time to write tests!</p>
<p>Unit tests are waste of time. They slow you down and decrease your productivity!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how to write unit tests!</p></blockquote>
<p>So, in this post, I&#8217;m going to touch on these arguments.</p>
<h2>You do have time to write unit tests!</h2>
<p>When you don&#8217;t have a suite of automated tests, every time you make a simple change to your code, you run the application and test the same functions over and over!</p>
<p>If you spend less time on those tedious and repetitive manual tests, you&#8217;ll find enough time to write unit tests, at least for the critical parts of your application.</p>
<p>The good thing about unit tests is that you write them once, and run them over and over. You&#8217;ll get immediate feedback if your code is &#8220;really&#8221; working!</p>
<p>With these tests, you can test your business rules in a fraction of a second. Manually testing the functions with multiple execution paths takes a significant amount of time.</p>
<h2>Unit tests help you save time and money</h2>
<p><a href="http://blog.celerity.com/the-true-cost-of-a-software-bug" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiple studies</a> have shown that the later you catch a software bug in the software development lifecycle, the more costly it is to fix it.</p>
<p>With unit tests, you can catch a lot of bugs early on in the software development lifecycle. You catch bugs right when you&#8217;re coding before you deploy your application for QA testing or production!</p>
<p>The reality is that building software is costly. You either choose to pay that cost upfront by writing tests or pay a far greater cost to fix bugs after releasing your software.</p>
<p>Am I saying that with unit tests you release bug-free software? Not at all! But with unit tests, you release software of better quality and with fewer defects. Also, software built with unit testing in mind has a better design. You&#8217;ll end up with properly designed classes, each focusing on a single responsibility. You&#8217;ll have good separation of concerns in your code.</p>
<h2>Unit tests help you go faster!</h2>
<p>One of the common arguments about writing unit tests is that they slow you down. You have to write extra code to test your code and this delays the delivery. As you code, you also have to deal with broken tests. Fixing those tests, again, takes extra time.</p>
<p>Can you relate to this? If yes, let me tell you something: <strong>you got it wrong, my friend!</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Good&#8221; unit tests help you go faster. If your tests are 50 lines of code, where the first 30 lines are just the setup code and mock objects, you&#8217;re doing it wrong!</p>
<p>Your unit tests should be less than 5 lines of code. Yes, it is possible to write unit tests like that! If you want to learn how to write unit tests like that, <a href="https://programmingwithmosh.com/csharp-unit-testing/">check out my upcoming unit testing course.</a></p>
<h2>Unit tests tell what your code should do</h2>
<p>Good unit tests express what your code should do right now. They&#8217;re far better than those ugly and often outdated comments that you put above your code. Those comments don&#8217;t get compiled. As different developers work on the code, those comments get outdated. They rot. They stink.</p>
<p>Unit tests don&#8217;t! They get compiled. They express the behavior of your code. They act as a living documentation for your code.</p>
<h2>Not sure how to write unit tests?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working on a comprehensive course on unit testing for C# developers. In this course, I take you on a journey to master unit testing, from beginner to pro. You&#8217;re going to learn the secrets to write clean, maintainable and trustworthy tests. The kind of tests that you can rely upon. When they pass, you know your code is working and whey they fail, you know that something is wrong with your code.</p>
<p>It took me years to really master unit testing. I read several books, watched tons of videos, worked with different developers and tried different approaches to unit testing. Some worked, some failed. What you&#8217;ll find in this course is the result of the best practices I&#8217;ve discovered, packed with lots of real-world examples, exercises and step-by-step solutions.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll learn about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Characteristics of <strong>great unit tests</strong></li>
<li><strong>What to test and how</strong></li>
<li><strong>The tooling</strong></li>
<li>All about <strong>dependency injection</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mocks</strong>, what they are, when to use them and how</li>
<li><strong>Refactoring legacy, untestable code</strong> into loosely-coupled, testable code</li>
<li><strong>Tips and tricks</strong> to keep your tests clean</li>
<li><strong>Pitfalls to avoid</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And much, much more&#8230;</p>
<p>This course will be published over the next few days. If you like to be notified and get the course with an early bird discount, <a href="https://programmingwithmosh.com/join/">join my mailing list now</a>. I&#8217;ll send you an email as soon as the course is published.</p>

            <p>So, do you want to learn the fundamentals of Angular 4 in a quick and easy way? You have come to the right place! You don&#8217;t need familiarity with any previous versions of Angular. In this tutorial, I&#8217;m going to take you from the ground up and show you Angular 4 in action. You only need a basic familiarity with <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.</p>
<p>If you learn better by videos, you can also watch this tutorial on YouTube; otherwise, continue reading.</p>

<h2>Beginner&#8217;s questions</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with a few beginner&#8217;s questions. If you&#8217;ve used any previous versions of Angular, feel free to skip this section and jump to &#8220;Getting the tools&#8221;.</p>
<h3>What is Angular?</h3>
<p>Angular is a framework for building client applications in HTML, CSS, and either JavaScript or a language like TypeScript that can be compiled (more accurately, transpiled) to JavaScript. If you have never worked with TypeScript before, don&#8217;t worry. I will give you the basics in order to complete this tutorial.</p>
<h3>What is TypeScript?</h3>
<p>TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. That means any valid JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code. But many prefer TypeScript because it has additional features that we don&#8217;t have in the current version of JavaScript that most browsers understand. So, when building Angular applications, we need to have our TypeScript code converted into JavaScript code that browsers can understand. This process is called <em>transpilation</em> which is the combination of <em>translate</em> and <em>compile</em>. And that&#8217;s the job of  the TypeScript compiler.</p>
<h3>Why do I need a framework like Angular?</h3>
<p>A common question a lot of beginners ask me is: &#8220;Why do we need Angular in the first place? What&#8217;s wrong with the plain old vanilla JavaScript and jQuery?&#8221;.</p>
<p>There is nothing inherently wrong with using vanilla JavaScript/jQuery. In fact, a lot of web applications out there are built this way. But as your application grows, structuring your code in a clean and maintainable and more importantly, testable way, becomes harder and harder. I&#8217;m not saying this is impossible. But using a framework like Angular, makes your life far easier. Sure, there is a learning curve involved, but once you master Angular, you&#8217;ll be able to build client applications <span style="text-decoration: underline;">faster and easier</span>.</p>
<h3>Is Angular better than React/Vue.js?</h3>
<p>These days there is a lot of debate between Angular vs React vs Vue.js. Whether Angular is better than React or Vue.js depends on how you define &#8220;better&#8221;. Each of these frameworks have strengths and weaknesses and there is no one shiny framework that makes every developer in the world happy. My suggestion to you is to learn the fundamentals of each of these frameworks and choose the one that works best for each project depending on its requirements.</p>
<h2>Getting the tools</h2>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s get dive into some code and get our hands dirty! The first thing you need to install is the latest version of Node. So, if you haven&#8217;t installed Node, head over to <a href="https://nodejs.org">nodejs.org</a>, and install the latest <strong>stable</strong> version.</p>
<p>Node comes with a tool called <strong>Node Package Manager</strong> or <strong>NPM</strong>, which is used for installing third-party libraries. In this tutorial, we&#8217;re going to use NPM to install Angular CLI. That is a command-line tool we use to create a new Angular project. It is also used for generating some boilerplate code during development (such as components, services, etc) as well as building an application for deployment. We do all this in the terminal.</p>
<p>So, once again in the <strong>Terminal</strong>, run the following command to install Angular CLI:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm install -g @angular/cli</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>-g</strong> flag stands for global. If you don&#8217;t put -g here, Angular CLI will be installed only in the current folder, and it&#8217;s not going to be accessible anywhere else.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re on Mac, you need to put <strong>sudo</strong> at the beginning of this command to execute it as an administrator; otherwise, you&#8217;ll get permission errors.</p>
<h2>Your First Angular App</h2>
<p>So with Angular CLI in place, now we can create a new Angular project using the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ng new hello-world</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we can access Angular CLI using <strong>ng</strong>. We provide a command (in this case <strong>new</strong>) to instruct Angular CLI on what we want it to do for us. Here, we are telling Angular CLI to generate a new project called &#8220;hello-world&#8221; and store it in a folder with the same name. We&#8217;ll be looking at these generated files shortly. For now, let&#8217;s finish the first step and see our new Angular app in the browser.</p>
<p>So, run the following commands in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd hello-world
npm install 
ng serve</code></pre>
<p>With the second command (<strong>npm install</strong>) we install all the dependencies of our application. The last command (<strong>ng serve</strong>)<strong> </strong>compiles our application and hosts it using a lightweight web server. Now, we can access our application at <strong>http://localhost:4200. </strong></p>
<p>So, open up your browser and navigate to this address. You should see the following page:</p>

<p>Congratulations! You generated and served your first Angular 4 application. Now, let&#8217;s have a quick look at the files and folders in our new Angular project.</p>
<h2>Structure of Angular Projects</h2>
<p>Inside the generated folder, you&#8217;ll find the following top-level folders:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>e2e</strong>: includes end-to-end tests.</li>
<li><strong>node_modules</strong>: all the third-party libraries that our project is dependent upon.</li>
<li><strong>src</strong>: the actual source code of our Angular application.</li>
</ul>
<p>99.9% of the time you&#8217;ll be working with the files inside the <strong>src </strong>folder. But let&#8217;s quickly overview the other files we have in this project:</p>
<p><strong>angular-cli.json: </strong>a configuration file for Angular CLI. We use this file to import third-party stylesheets or define additional environments (eg testing environment) for our application.</p>
<p><strong>package.json: </strong>a standard file for Node-based projects. It contains metadata about our project, such as its name, version as well as the list of its dependencies.</p>
<p><strong>protractor.conf.js: </strong>Protractor is a tool for running end-to-end tests for Angular projects. We hardly need to modify this file.</p>
<p><strong>karma.conf.js: </strong>Karma is a test runner for JavaScript applications. This file contains some configuration for Karma. We rarely need to modify this file.</p>
<p><strong>tsconfig.json: </strong>includes setting for the TypeScript compiler. Again, we hardly, if ever, need to modify this file.</p>
<p><strong>tslint.json: </strong>includes the settings for TSLint which is a popular tool for linting TypeScript code. That means it checks the quality of our TypeScript code based on a few configurable parameters. This is especially important in a team environment to ensure that everyone follows the same conventions and produces code of the same quality. We can run linting on our code using Angular CLI in the terminal or we can add it to our editor as a plug-in.</p>
<p>So, as you see, all these files are configuration files that work smoothly out of the box. Unless you want to customize them for your specific environment, you don&#8217;t ever have to modify them.</p>
<h2>Architecture of Angular Apps</h2>
<p>Ok, so you&#8217;ve learned how to generate and serve a new Angular project. You&#8217;ve also learned about various files and folders in a new Angular project. Now, let&#8217;s look at the architecture of Angular applications.</p>
<p>The most fundamental building block in an Angular application is a <em>component</em>. You can think of a component as a view component. It represents a view or part of a view (what the user sees). A component consists of three pieces:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1091" data-permalink="https://programmingwithmosh.com/angular/angular-4-tutorial/attachment/master-template-copy-001/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Master-Template-copy.001.jpeg?fit=694%2C218&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="694,218" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="Master Template copy.001" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Master-Template-copy.001.jpeg?fit=300%2C94&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Master-Template-copy.001.jpeg?fit=694%2C218&amp;ssl=1" class="size-full wp-image-1091 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Master-Template-copy.001.jpeg?resize=694%2C218&#038;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Master-Template-copy.001.jpeg?w=694&amp;ssl=1 694w, https://i1.wp.com/programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Master-Template-copy.001.jpeg?resize=300%2C94&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HTML markup</strong>: to render that view</li>
<li><strong>State</strong>: the data to display on the view</li>
<li><strong>Behavior</strong>: the logic behind that view. For example, what should happen when the user clicks a button.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A component can contain other components. For example, let&#8217;s imagine you&#8217;re going to build a web app like Twitter using Angular. In your implementation, you may have a tree of component likes this:</p>
<ul>
<li>App
<ul>
<li>NavBar</li>
<li>SideBar</li>
<li>ContentArea
<ul>
<li>Tweets
<ul>
<li>Tweet
<ul>
<li>Like</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, at the root of the application, we have a component called <strong>AppComponent</strong>. This is the root of every Angular application. Our <strong>AppComponent</strong> contains 3 child components: <strong>NavBar</strong>, <strong>SideBar</strong>, and <strong>ContentArea</strong>.</p>
<p>The reason for such separation is because the navigation bar is logically a separate part of the view. It has its own markup, state, and behavior.  We can encapsulate all that using a component called <strong>NavBarComponent</strong>. This way, when modifying or extending the navigation bar of our application, we can focus on a small component with a lightweight template.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Component-based Architecture</h2>
<p>As you can see, this component-based architecture makes our applications more organized and maintainable. Plus, we can potentially reuse these components in various parts of an application or in an entirely different application. For example, tomorrow, we can grab this <strong>NavBarComponent</strong> and put it in an entirely different project. We just need to modify the links. But all the HTML markup will remain the same.</p>
<p>Back to our tree of components, you can see that inside the content area, we have a tree of components like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tweets
<ul>
<li>Tweet
<ul>
<li>Like</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, this is one way to model this. We don&#8217;t necessarily have to have a separate component for the list of tweets and each tweet. We could combine <strong>TweetsComponent</strong> and <strong>TweetComponent</strong> into one component. But, I&#8217;d like to separate the <strong>LikeComponent</strong> because we could potentially reuse this like button somewhere else in this application or in another application. Even if we don&#8217;t reuse it, separating the markup, state and behavior of this like button into a separate component, makes our application more maintainable and testable.</p>
<h2>An Angular Component in Action</h2>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s inspect a real component in action.</p>
<p>Back to our project, open up the <strong>src/app</strong> folder. Inside this folder, you should see the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li>app.component.css</li>
<li>app.component.html</li>
<li>app.component.spec.ts</li>
<li>app.component.ts</li>
<li>app.module.ts</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These files represent <strong>AppComponent</strong>, which is the root component for our application. In this particular case, all these files are inside the app folder. But when we generate a new component using Angular CLI, all the files that make up a component will be grouped by a folder.</p>
<p>So, in terms of the implementation, each component in an Angular project is physically implemented using four files:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A CSS file</strong>: where we define all the styles for that component. These styles will only be scoped to this component and will not leak to the outside. This is what <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Shadow_DOM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shadow DOM</a> does. But not all browsers today support Shadow DOM. So, Angular uses a technique to emulate the Shadow DOM.</li>
<li><strong>An HTML file</strong>: contains the markup to render in the DOM.</li>
<li><strong>A spec file</strong>: includes the unit tests.</li>
<li><strong>A TypeScript file</strong>: where we define the state (the data to display) and behavior (logic) of our component.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also see an app.module.ts file.  This file defines the root module of our application and tells angular how to assemble the app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Creating a Component</h2>
<p>Now that you know what a component is, let&#8217;s use Angular CLI and add a new component to this application.</p>
<p>Imagine we want to build an e-commerce application. On the home page, we&#8217;re going to display the list of products and below each product, we want to have a button for adding that product to the shopping cart.</p>
<p>So, for this exercise, we want to create a super simple component to represent each product on the home page. This component will include the HTML markup to display that product, and it&#8217;ll respond to the click event of a button to add that product to the shopping cart.</p>
<p>When we click this button, it also shows the number of products of this type in the shopping cart. Initially, the number should be 0. Every time we click the Add to Shopping Cart button, the number is increased. Of course, in a real-world application, there&#8217;s far more complexity involved. For example, we may want to call some back-end services to store this item in a database. But for now, let&#8217;s just focus on the fundamentals. If you understand the fundamentals well, you can always add these other details later. So, for now, forget about the server-side, databases and other complexities.</p>
<p>Ok, we&#8217;re ready to create a component. We can manually create all those four files by hand, but there is a faster way. We can use Angular CLI!</p>
<h2>Generating a Component Using Angular CLI</h2>
<p>Run the following command in the terminal, inside the project folder:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ng g c product</code></pre>
<p>Here, <strong>g</strong> is short for <strong>generate</strong>, <strong>c</strong> is short for <strong>component</strong> and <strong>product</strong> is the name of our component. Now, if you look at the project folder, inside the <strong>src/</strong><strong>app </strong>folder, you should see a new folder called <strong>product. </strong>Expand this folder. You should see the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li>product.component.css</li>
<li>product.component.html</li>
<li>product.component.spec.ts</li>
<li>product.component.ts</li>
</ul>
<p>Open <strong>product.component.ts</strong>. This is what you should see:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-product',
  templateUrl: './product.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./product.component.css']
})
export class ProductComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit() { 
  }

</code></pre>
<p>If this code looks complex to you, don&#8217;t worry! I&#8217;m going to make it super simple. It&#8217;s actually far easier than you may think!</p>
<p>For now, I want you to note the value of the <strong>selector </strong>property. It&#8217;s <strong>app-product. </strong>This is a CSS selector. So <strong>app-product </strong>represents an element by this name. With this, we can extend the HTML vocabulary. Anywhere we add this <strong>app-product </strong>element, Angular will render the HTML markup of ProductComponent inside that element. So, let&#8217;s add this element to the template for our AppComponent.</p>
<h2>Using a Component</h2>
<p>Open up <strong>src/app/app.component.html.</strong> Replace all the markup with the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;app-product&gt;&lt;/app-product&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Now, our application includes a tree of components:</p>
<ul>
<li>App
<ul>
<li>Product</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the root of this tree, we have our <strong>AppComponent. </strong>This component includes a child component: <strong>ProductComponent. </strong></p>
<p>Save the changes. Back to the browser, now, you should see this:</p>

<p>Our ProductComponent has a simple template that includes <strong>&#8220;product works!&#8221;</strong>. We can modify <strong>product.component.html </strong>and add some complex markup here. For example, we can use Bootstrap 4 cards to render the product inside a card.<br />

<p>But for now, we don&#8217;t want to waste our time and make our application pretty. Our focus is on understanding Angular. We can always come back to the template for <strong>ProductComponent </strong>and improve it.</p>
<h2>Examining an Angular Component</h2>
<p>You successfully generated and used a component. Now, let&#8217;s examine this component in detail. So, open up <strong>product.component.ts. </strong>Here is the code for reference:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-typescript">import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-product',
  templateUrl: './product.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./product.component.css']
})
export class ProductComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit() { 
  }</code></pre>
<p>Inside of this file, we have a TypeScript <em>class</em> called <strong>ProductComponent</strong>.</p>
<h3>What is a Class?</h3>
<p>A class is a fundamental building block of many object-oriented programming languages. It&#8217;s a container for a bunch of related functions and variables.</p>
<p>So, unlike vanilla JavaScript where all our functions and variables are hanging from the global namespace, we put them in containers called classes. With these classes, we don&#8217;t pollute the global namespace and as a result, we won&#8217;t have one function overwriting another function with the same name. Because these functions are now in separate containers (classes). Also, because each class includes a bunch of highly related functions and variables, our code is more organized and maintainable.</p>
<p>In object-oriented programming terms, we call these functions and variables that reside in a class, <em>methods</em> and <em>fields/properties</em> respectively. Fields and properties are technically different but they are often used interchangeably. A field is like a variable where we store some data. A property looks like a field from the outside, but internally, it is a function around a field that gives us read or write access to that field. If this sounds confusing, don&#8217;t worry about it now. I&#8217;m planning to publish a separate post about TypeScript. For now, you can assume fields and properties are the same, even though they are not!</p>
<h3>Example of a Class</h3>
<p>So, in <strong>product.component.ts</strong>, we have a class called <strong>ProductComponent</strong>. This class has 2 functions (methods): <strong>constructor</strong> and <strong>ngOnInit</strong>.</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-typescript">export class ProductComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit() { 
  }</code></pre>
<p><strong>Constructor</strong> is a reserved keyword in TypeScript. A method by that name is a special method in a class. This method is called automatically when we create an instance of that class.</p>
<p><strong>ngOnInit</strong> is a special method in Angular. Angular calls this method when it creates an instance of this component and displays it to the user in the browser.</p>
<p>For this exercise, we don&#8217;t have to worry about either of these methods. So, delete both of them. You should also delete <strong>implements OnInit </strong>in front of the class name. For now, don&#8217;t worry about it, but basically, it tells Angular that this class has some initialization code that should be executed before this component is displayed to the user.</p>
<p>So, your code should look like this:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-typescript">import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-product',
  templateUrl: './product.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./product.component.css']
})
export class ProductComponent {
}</code></pre>
<h2>Component Metadata</h2>
<p>So, you&#8217;ve seen that we implement a component using a TypeScript class. But a class on its own is just a class. It only includes some data and logic for a view. It doesn&#8217;t include any HTML markup or CSS styles. In order to attach these to this class, we need to promote this class to a component. We can do this by using the<strong> @Component()</strong> decorator function on top of this class (lines 3-7):</p>
<pre class="line-numbers" data-line="3-7"><code class="language-typescript">import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-product',
  templateUrl: './product.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./product.component.css']
})
export class ProductComponent {
}</code></pre>
<p>With this, we can attach metadata to this class that Angular understands. This <strong>@Component()</strong> decorator function is defined in Angular and you can see we&#8217;re importing it on line 1. It takes an object with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>selector</li>
<li>templateUrl</li>
<li>styleUrls</li>
</ul>
<p>You&#8217;ve seen the <strong>selector </strong>in action. It associates a new HTML element to this component. With this, we can extend the standard HTML vocabulary. So, now we have a new custom element (<strong>app-product</strong>) that we can use anywhere in our application. When Angular sees that element, it&#8217;ll place the HTML markup of our <strong>ProductComponent </strong>inside that element.</p>
<p>The other 2 properties (<strong>templateUrl </strong>and <strong>styleUrls</strong>)  are self-explanatory. They specify the path to the HTML template and CSS file(s) for this component.</p>
<h2>Property Binding</h2>
<p>In Angular, unlike vanilla JavaScript or jQuery, we don&#8217;t work directly with the DOM. So, we don&#8217;t write code like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">$("#myElement").text("something")
</code></pre>
<p>Instead, we use <em>property binding</em>. Let me show you how that works.</p>
<p>In our <strong>ProductComponent</strong>, let&#8217;s add a new field:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers" data-line="9"><code class="language-typescript">import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-product',
  templateUrl: './product.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./product.component.css']
})
export class ProductComponent {
   title = 'USB Stick 8GB';
}</code></pre>
<p>This <strong>title</strong> field contains the title for our product. In a real-world scenario, we get this title from a database somewhere on the server. So we don&#8217;t hardcode it here. But for now, let&#8217;s not worry about this and see property binding in action.</p>
<p>Now, open up <strong>product.component.html</strong>. Replace all the markup there with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;p&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This special double curly brace syntax you see here is what we call <em>interpolation</em> in Angular. Fancy name again, right? This basically tells Angular to replace what we have between curly braces with the value of the <strong>title</strong> field in our component.</p>
<p>This syntax is a shorthand for the actual property binding syntax we have in Angular. The code you wrote above is equivalent to the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;p [innerHtml]="title"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>What is this? Very simple! In vanilla JavaScript, we can simply get a reference to an element in the DOM and set its innerHTML property like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var el = document.getElementById("myElement");
el.innerHTML = "USB Stick 8GB";
</code></pre>
<p>So, every DOM element has a property called <strong>innerHTML</strong>. In our Angular application, we&#8217;re using the square bracket syntax to bind a property of a DOM element to a field/property in our component:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;p [innerHtml]="title"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>So, at run-time, Angular will set the <strong>innerHtml</strong> property of this paragraph to the <strong>title</strong> field we defined in our component. And more importantly, if the value of our <strong>title</strong> field changes in the future, Angular will automatically update the view (DOM) for us! This is property binding in action. We have bound the <strong>innerHTML</strong> property of this element to the <strong>title</strong> field of our <strong>ProductComponent</strong>.</p>
<h2>A Simple Exercise</h2>
<p>Now, here is a simple exercise for you. I want you to extend our product component and display the number of USB sticks in the shopping cart below the name of this product. So, stop reading and make any necessary changes in the code. Then, come back here and see my solution.</p>
<p>Ok, so you should have added a new field in <strong>ProductComponent</strong>:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers" data-line="5"><code class="language-typescript">export class ProductComponent {
   title = "USB Stick 8GB";
   itemCount = 0; 
}</code></pre>
<p>And used interpolation or property binding syntax to render it in the template:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;p&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{ itemCount }}&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Event Binding</h2>
<p>Similar to property binding, we have another concept in Angular called <em>event binding</em>. With property binding, we bind properties of DOM elements to fields/properties in our component. With event binding, we bind events of DOM elements (such as clicks) to methods in our component. So, for example, when the user clicks on a button, a method in our component will be called.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to extend our product component and add a button to increase the number of USB sticks in the shopping cart. So, modify <strong>product.component.html</strong> as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">
&lt;p&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{ itemCount }}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;button (click)="addItem()"&gt;Add&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Note the difference between property and event binding syntax. We use square brackets for property bindings and parenthesis for event binding. With this code, whenever our button is clicked, Angular calls the addItem() method in our component.</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s implement this method in our component. Open up<strong> product.component.ts</strong>:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers" data-line="5-7"><code class="language-typescript">export class ProductComponent {
   title = "USB Stick 8GB";
   itemCount = 0; 

   addItem() { 
      this.itemCount++;
   } 
}</code></pre>
<p>Here, we&#8217;re simply incrementing the <strong>itemCount</strong> field. Now, save the changes and go back to the browser. Test this application by clicking the Add button. You can see the count gets updated immediately. This is the beauty of property and event binding in action!</p>
<p>As I explained, Angular watches our <strong>itemCount</strong> field. When its value gets changed, Angular updates the DOM immediately.</p>
<p>What you&#8217;ve seen far is just the tip of the iceberg. There is far more to property and event binding and Angular in general. It&#8217;s impossible to cover it all in one blog post. If you&#8217;re serious about learning Angular, I have a <a href="/courses/complete-angular-master-class/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>complete course with 30 hours of high-quality videos</strong></a>. This is equivalent to a book with more than a thousand pages!</p>
<h2>Recap</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s quickly recap what you&#8217;ve learned in this post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Angular is a framework for building client apps with HTML, CSS and TypeScript.</li>
<li>It gives our applications a proper, maintainable and testable structure.</li>
<li>At the core of every Angular application, we have a tree of components.</li>
<li>Each component encapsulates the state (data), the HTML markup and the behavior for a view.</li>
<li>At a minimum, a component is implemented using a class. This class may include a bunch of fields for displaying data and methods, which will be called in response to events raised from the DOM events.</li>
<li>A component may have an external template stored in a separate HTML file.</li>
<li>It may also include one or more external stylesheets.</li>
<li>A component also has a selector. That tells Angular where in the DOM to place this component.</li>
<li>We use the property binding syntax (square brackets) to bind properties of DOM elements to fields/properties in our components.</li>
<li>When the value of these fields/properties change, Angular automatically updates the DOM (view).</li>
<li>We use the event binding syntax (parenthesis) to bind events of DOM elements to methods in our component.</li>
<li>Angular automatically calls these methods to handle events raised from the DOM elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again, if you want to <strong>learn everything about Angular from the basic to the advanced topics</strong>, I encourage you to enroll in my <a href="/courses/complete-angular-master-class/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>complete Angular course</strong></a>. This is far easier and faster than jumping from one tutorial to another. With this course, you can learn all these concepts in one place, step-by-step and you&#8217;ll build and deploy real e-commerce app with Angular and Firebase at the end of the course.</p>

          <h1 class="title"><a href="https://programmingwithmosh.com/csharp/unit-testing/">What is Unit Testing and Why You Need to Learn It</a></h1>
          

            <p>In this post, I&#8217;m going to give you a brief introduction to unit testing and its benefits. So, let&#8217;s get started!</p>
<h2>What is unit testing?</h2>
<p>Unit testing is the practice of writing code to test your code and then run those tests in an automated fashion.</p>
<p>Here is an example. Imagine you have this function somewhere in your code. It&#8217;s a basic calculate function that takes an input and depending on some conditions, it returns different values.</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public float CalculateTax(int input) 
{
    if (x) return ...;
    if (y) return ...;
    return ...;
}</code></pre>
<p>If you want to test this function manually, you have to run your application, perhaps you have to login, or maybe do a few clicks here and there to get to a page where this function is used. Then, you have to fill out a form, submit it and verify if this function returned the right result. And then you have to repeat all these steps, each time using different values in your form.</p>
<h2>Manual testing is expensive!</h2>
<p>As you can see, this is very time-consuming.  This workflow to test this function may take several minutes every time! Now to make matters worse,  this is not the only function in your application. In a real application, you have tens or hundreds of functions like this! As your application grows in size and complexity, the time required to manually test all the different bits and pieces increases exponentially. So, that&#8217;s why we use automated testing.</p>

<p>With automated testing, you create a separate project for writing tests. In that project you&#8217;ll write code and directly call this function with different inputs and verify that this function returns the right output.</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">var result = CalculateTax(1);
Verify(result == 1.5f);</code></pre>
<p>We refer to these types of tests as <strong>unit tests</strong>. With unit tests, we test a unit of the application in isolation without its external dependencies such as files, databases, web services, etc.  Tests that include these external dependencies are called <strong>integration tests, </strong>and that&#8217;s the topic for another post.</p>
<h2>Unit tests are repeatable!</h2>
<p>The good thing about unit tests is that they are repeatable. You write them once and run them a million times! So, every time you change your code, every time you commit your code to a repository, and before deploying your application. With this approach, you can test all the execution paths in this function in a fraction of a second! You can write several hundreds or thousands of unit tests for various parts of your application, and run them all in just a few seconds.</p>
<h2>Unit tests help you deploy with confidence!</h2>
<p>If you properly cover your code with a comprehensive suite of tests, you can run these tests before deploying your application to the production. If you&#8217;ve broken something that used to previously work, you&#8217;ll know straight away. With unit tests you can catch more bugs <strong><em>before</em></strong> deploying our application and this means you can deploy with confidence.</p>
<p>Have you ever been in a situation where you deployed your application, left the office thinking everything is working, and then got a call from your boss or an end-user, telling you that one of the major functions of the application is not working? Then you had to go back to the office and you thought that was a quick fix, but you ended up staying there till midnight!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why you should write tests:<strong> to reduce the number of defects or bugs that will go in the production. </strong>Note that I&#8217;m not saying that with unit tests you&#8217;re gonna release bug free software. That&#8217;s not true! But you can certainly reduce the number of bugs and improve the quality of your software.</p>
<h2>Unit tests help you refactor with confidence!</h2>
<p>Refactoring means changing the structure of your code without changing its behaviour. If you extract a few lines of a method into a separate private method, that&#8217;s refactoring. If you rename a method, that&#8217;s refactoring too. You&#8217;re changing the structure of your code to make it cleaner and more maintainable, but you&#8217;re not changing the functionality.</p>
<p>When you don&#8217;t have unit tests, every time you refactor your code, you have to manually test every part of the application that could be affected by your refactoring. And this is very painful because first of all, it&#8217;s time consuming, and second, as your application grows, you may forget about the parts that need to be tested! With unit tests, every time you refactor your code, you run your tests and make sure you didn&#8217;t accidentally break anything that used to previously work.</p>
<h2>Unit tests help you write better code!</h2>
<p>When writing tests, you&#8217;re forced to think about the edge cases of every function in your application. You write tests for these functions, giving them various inputs and make sure they behave as you expect. This will help you produce better quality software with less defects. A lot of bugs in our applications are the result of unforeseen edge cases. One of your functions receives an input that you forgot to predict and boom! It blows up!  With unit tests, you make sure that every function works with different inputs under varying circumstances.</p>
<p>Also, applications written with unit testing in mind often have cleaner and more maintainable source code. That means smaller functions with a clear responsibility and few parameters.</p>
<h2>Benefits of unit testing</h2>
<p>So, to recap, unit tests help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Test your code frequently and in less time</li>
<li>Catch more bugs before deploying</li>
<li>Deploy your application with confidence</li>
<li>Refactor your code with confidence</li>
<li>Write cleaner and maintainable code</li>
</ul>
<h2>You need to have unit testing on your resume!</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re a senior developer, you must know how to write unit tests! If you don&#8217;t know, you&#8217;re probably more of an intermediate-level developer even if you have a senior position at your company.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a junior/intermediate-level developer and want to become a senior developer, you must have unit testing on your resume to get a better job. Most good companies with good programmers practice unit testing these days.</p>
<h2>Unit testing C# code</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m currently working on a comprehensive course on unit testing for C# developers. In this course, I&#8217;ll take you from the ground and teach you how to write unit tests for your C# code. I&#8217;m planning to release this course by the end of October. If you&#8217;re interested to get this course with an early-bird discount, <a href="https://programmingwithmosh.com/join">drop your email and join my mailing list</a>. I won&#8217;t spam you, and you can unsubscribe at anytime.</p>

            <p>One question (or more accurately, comment) that I frequently get on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/programmingwithmosh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> videos is:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230; is not working!</p></blockquote>
<p>Examples: &#8220;npm install is not working&#8221;, &#8220;interpolation is not working&#8221;, etc.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not working&#8221; is not helpful! It doesn&#8217;t tell me or others about the problem you&#8217;re facing.</p>
<p>What error do you get? Have you tried to Google the exact same error message? If not, did you know that if you do that, 90% of the time, you can find the answer to your question within minutes? In fact, 90% of the time, the first link on Google search result is a link to a page on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StackOverflow</a>, where someone else faced the exact same problem!</p>
<h2>3 tips that make you a better developer</h2>
<p><strong>Tip 1: </strong>Learn the art of asking &#8216;programming&#8217; questions. Be specific about why &#8220;it&#8217;s not working&#8221;!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 2:</strong> Learn to find the answer to your question yourself. You cannot always reach out for help every time &#8220;it&#8217;s not working&#8221;. Successful programmers are independent. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linus Torvalds</a>, the creator of Linux, even wrote his own editor and assembler! Now, you don&#8217;t need to do this to be independent, but a Google search takes only a few seconds and helps you become less dependent on other developers in your team.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 3:</strong> Read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rubber duck debugging</a>. It works!</p>

            <p>In this post, I&#8217;m going to list my top favorite <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Code (VSCode)</a> extensions for building Angular applications. If you know a great extension that is missing here, please let us know using the comment box below the post.</p>
<h2>Installing an Extension</h2>
<p>If you know how to install an extension in VSCode, feel free to skip this section. Otherwise, launch VSCode, and open the <strong>Extensions</strong> tab from the left side bar. Here, you can see the list of installed extensions. You can also search for other extensions. Once you find an extension, simply click the <strong>Install</strong> button. Then, reload VSCode and you&#8217;re good to go.</p>
<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rbbit.typescript-hero" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypeScript Hero</a></h2>
<p>This is by far my absolute favorite extension! You no longer have to manually import types in TypeScript. TypeScript Hero automatically imports the types for you as you write code. When pasting some code from somewhere else, you can also add all the missing import statements in one go!</p>
<p>Another useful feature of this extension is that it allows you to sort and remove the unused import statements. You also get code completion and several other useful features. Highly recommended!</p>
<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Angular.ng-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular Language Service</a></h2>
<p>This extension provides a rich editing experience for Angular templates. Imagine you have a field in your component as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">course = { 
   title: 'The Complete Angular Course', 
   author: { 
      name: 'Mosh Hamedani'
   }
} 
</code></pre>
<p>With this extension, you&#8217;ll get auto-completion in your HTML templates:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1155" data-permalink="https://programmingwithmosh.com/angular/essential-vscode-extensions-for-angular-developers/attachment/autocompletion/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Autocompletion.gif?fit=640%2C122&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="640,122" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Autocompletion" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Autocompletion.gif?fit=300%2C57&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Autocompletion.gif?fit=640%2C122&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1155" src="https://i2.wp.com/programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Autocompletion.gif?resize=640%2C122" alt="Autocompletion" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bracket Pair Colorizer</a></h2>
<p>This extension allows matching brackets to be identified with colors.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1159" data-permalink="https://programmingwithmosh.com/angular/essential-vscode-extensions-for-angular-developers/attachment/bracket/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Bracket.gif?fit=640%2C122&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="640,122" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Bracket" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Bracket.gif?fit=300%2C57&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Bracket.gif?fit=640%2C122&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1159" src="https://i1.wp.com/programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Bracket.gif?resize=640%2C122" alt="Bracket" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stringham.move-ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Move TS</a></h2>
<p>As your application grows, you may want to break it down into smaller and more maintainable modules. You&#8217;ll have to move files and folders around. But what happens to all your import statements? They break! So, that&#8217;s what this extension is for. With Move TS extension, you can simply move files/folders around and this extension will automatically update your import statements.</p>
<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Material Icon Theme</a></h2>
<p>Do you like to have pretty icons in the project explorer? Install this extension!</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1166" data-permalink="https://programmingwithmosh.com/angular/essential-vscode-extensions-for-angular-developers/attachment/icons/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Icons.gif?fit=640%2C298&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="640,298" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Icons" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Icons.gif?fit=300%2C140&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Icons.gif?fit=640%2C298&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1166" src="https://i0.wp.com/programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Icons.gif?resize=640%2C298" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.Angular2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular TypeScript Snippets</a></h2>
<p>Another useful extension developed by John Papa that boosts your productivity when building Angular applications. It gives you a bunch of code snippets that allow you to quickly generate code. There are snippets for creating a component, service, directive, etc. You may argue that now we can easily create these artifacts using Angular CLI and that is absolutely right. However, this extension gives you some useful HTML snippets as well:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1153" data-permalink="https://programmingwithmosh.com/angular/essential-vscode-extensions-for-angular-developers/attachment/angular-typescript-snippet/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Angular-TypeScript-Snippet.gif?fit=640%2C90&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="640,90" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Angular TypeScript Snippets" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Angular-TypeScript-Snippet.gif?fit=300%2C42&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Angular-TypeScript-Snippet.gif?fit=640%2C90&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1153" src="https://i0.wp.com/programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Angular-TypeScript-Snippet.gif?resize=640%2C90" alt="Angular TypeScript Snippets" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>You can find the complete list of snippets provided by this extension <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.Angular2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

          <h1 class="title"><a href="https://programmingwithmosh.com/angular/common-angular-errors/">Common Angular Errors</a></h1>
          

            <p>In this post, I&#8217;m going to list the most common errors you may encounter while getting started with Angular. For each error, I&#8217;m going to explain what it means and how to solve it.</p>
<p>This post is a work in progress and I&#8217;m planning to add more errors. If there is an error you encounter often, please let us know by dropping a comment.</p>
<h2>Error 1: &#8216;ng&#8217; is not recognized</h2>
<p>When creating a new project with Angular CLI, you may receive the following error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">'ng' is not recognized as an internal or external command.</code></pre>
<p>This error is simply telling you that Angular CLI is either not installed or not added to the PATH. To solve this error, first, make sure you&#8217;re running <strong>Node 6.9</strong> or higher. A lot of errors can be resolved by simply upgrading your Node to the latest stable version.</p>
<p>Open up the Terminal on macOS/Linux or Command Prompt on Windows and run the following command to find out the version of Node you are running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">node --version</code></pre>
<p>If you&#8217;re running an earlier version of Node, head over to <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nodejs.org</a> and download the installer for the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">latest stable version</span>.</p>
<p>Once you have installed Node 6.9+, you need to install Angular CLI globally:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm install -g @angular/cli</code></pre>
<p>Note the -g flag here. This tells NPM that you want to install this package globally so you can run it from any folders on your machine.</p>
<h2>Error 2: node_modules appears empty</h2>
<p>When you run <strong>ng serve</strong>, you may receive the following error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">node_modules appears empty, you may need to run `npm install`.</code></pre>
<p>Our Angular applications use a bunch of 3rd-party libraries. These libraries are stored in the <strong>node_modules</strong> folder inside your project folder. When you create a new project using Angular CLI, these third-party libraries should be installed automatically. However, if you&#8217;re using a corrupted or a buggy version of Angular CLI, these libraries are not installed. So, you need to manually install them.</p>
<p>To solve this error, run <strong>npm install</strong> from the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">project folder</span>. This command will look at <strong>package.json</strong> in your project folder. This file includes the list of dependencies of your project. NPM will download and store these dependencies in the <strong>node_modules</strong> folder.</p>

          <h1 class="title"><a href="https://programmingwithmosh.com/asp-net/layered-architecture/">Layered Architecture in ASP.NET Core Applications</a></h1>
          

            <p>One of the viewers of my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/programmingwithmosh" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> asked me an interesting question. He mentioned in a typical layered architecture, he sees ASP.NET MVC building blocks (Controller, View, and Model) as part of the presentation layer. These days, however, a lot of modern applications are built with Angular/React on the client and ASP.NET Core (Web API) on the server. So, what is the presentation layer in this kind of architecture? Let&#8217;s see!</p>
<p>With this stack, we have the following layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presentation</li>
<li>Service</li>
<li>Business Logic/Application Core</li>
<li>Data Access/Persistence</li>
</ul>
<h2>Presentation Layer</h2>
<p>Your Angular components, their templates, and the models you define in your Angular app are all presentation layer artifacts.</p>
<h2>Service Layer</h2>
<p>The confusing thing about this layer is that the term &#8220;service&#8221; is overloaded and it means different things to different people. In the context of a layered architecture, it wraps an application and exposes the application functionality in terms of a simple API that the user interface can talk to. This is the classic definition. Think of it as the glue between the presentation and business logic layers.</p>
<p>Now, in our modern stack, our logical service layer is physically composed of two parts: one part is on the client (Angular HTTP services) and the other part is on the server (ASP.NET Core controllers). These Angular services and ASP.NET Core controllers are very cohesive. The methods on these services (eg CourseService.getCourses()) talk directly to the endpoints exposed by your ASP.NET Core controllers.</p>
<h2>Business Logic Layer</h2>
<p>In your ASP.NET Core controllers, you often use repository interfaces (<strong>ICourseRepository</strong>), domain classes (<strong>Course</strong>) and services (<strong>PhotoService</strong>). All these are part of the business logic layer. They represent the core of an application irrespective of any presentation or persistence frameworks.</p>
<p>Note that here I&#8217;m talking about repository <em>interfaces</em> and not their implementations. These implementations are part of the data access/persistence layer.</p>
<p>Also, note that the services we have here are responsible for orchestration. For example, when adding a photo to a course, first, you need to store that photo in the file system (or some other kind of storage), and then you need to add it to the database (using a repository interface). Here is an example:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate" title="">
// Store the file first 
var uploadsPath = Path.Combine(host.WebRoot, &quot;uploads&quot;);
if (!Directory.Exists(uploadsPath))
    Directory.CreateDirectory(uploadsPath);

var fileName = Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + Path.GetExtension(file.FileName);
var filePath = Path.Combine(uploadsPath, fileName);

using (var stream = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Create))
{  
    file.Copyto(stream);
}

// Add a record to the database
var photo = new Photo { FileName = fileName };
repository.Add(photo);
unitOfWork.Complete(); 
</pre>
<p>You wouldn&#8217;t write all this logic inside an ASP.NET Core Controller. Imagine, tomorrow you decide to use a different framework. You want to re-use as much code as possible. By encapsulating this code in a service (<strong>PhotoService.AddPhoto()</strong>), you can switch from ASP.NET Core to a different framework with less effort.</p>
<h3>But wait for a second&#8230;</h3>
<p>Now, that strongly-opinionated developer comes and says: &#8220;But who does replace ASP.NET Core with something else? How often does that happen?&#8221; Let&#8217;s say never! By moving all this logic from a controller into a service, you put the responsibility where it really belongs. The result is cleaner, slimmer, easier to read and easier to test controllers.</p>
<p>Imagine a restaurant where the chef does it all. He&#8217;s at the door, welcoming guests, giving them a table, taking their order, then going in the kitchen, chopping the vegetables, cooking, washing the dishes, then coming out and giving the bill to the guests. Would you go to that restaurant? I hope not!</p>
<p>In a good and organized restaurant, there are a few people each focusing on only one job. The waiters/waitresses are purely responsible for welcoming the guests and giving them the bill. The chef is purely responsible for cooking. He or she doesn&#8217;t wash the dishes! By the same token, you should have classes that <em>do only one thing and do it well</em>. This is what we call <strong><em>separation of concerns</em></strong>. You should put the responsibility where it really belongs, even if you&#8217;re never going to change the presentation or persistence framework of your application.</p>
<p>So, once again, all your domain classes (<strong>Course</strong>), repository interfaces (<strong>ICourseRepository</strong>) and application services (<strong>PhotoService</strong>) are part of the business logic layer. They represent the core of your application completely decoupled from any presentation and persistence frameworks. This is what Uncle Bob defines as <a href="https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html" target="_blank">Clean Architecture</a>.</p>
<h2>Data Access Layer</h2>
<p>This layer is all about persistence. Here we have implementations tightly coupled to Entity Framework (or other frameworks) for persisting and retrieving data. If you&#8217;re using Entity Framework, your <strong>DbContext</strong> belongs in this layer. So do <strong>UnitofWork</strong> and <strong>Repository</strong> implementations.</p>
<h2>Splitting a Project</h2>
<p>Now, a common (and bad) practice I&#8217;ve seen some developers do, is that they <em>blindly</em> split an ASP.NET project into multiple class libraries, one for each layer. And with this, they assume just because they have a class library called <strong>MyProject.BLL </strong>or <strong>MyProject.DAL</strong>, they have properly layered their application. But that&#8217;s not necessarily right.</p>
<p>What matters is the direction of dependency and coupling between classes, not folders or projects. You can easily organize your classes into folders and projects but these classes can be poorly coupled to each other, which results in spaghetti architecture. Read my blog post on the topic:</p>
