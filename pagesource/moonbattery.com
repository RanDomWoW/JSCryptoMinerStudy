				<p>Today many will enjoy Saint Patrick&#8217;s Day in the traditional inebriated manner, even if they are not Irish. College students can&#8217;t seem to figure out whether this constitutes <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/03/16/students-asked-if-st-pats-drinking-holiday-is-cultural-appropriation-reactions-are-priceless">cultural appropriation</a>:</p>

<p>If they paid closer attention in their social justice classes, these students would know that cultural appropriation is like racism; it&#8217;s okay if you do it to white people. Otherwise, only whites would be allowed to use electricity, internal combustion engines, indoor plumbing, modern medicine, the Internet, airplanes, recorded music, et cetera. Irish are white (<a target="_blank" href="http://moonbattery.com/irish-government-bribes-press-to-promote-displacement-of-population-with-third-world-colonists/">for the time being</a>), so culturally appropriate away.</p>

<div class="entry">
				<p>In a country that has completely succumbed to moonbattery, hard work is not merely discouraged; it is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/france-baker-fined-refuse-days-off-court-ruling-cedric-vaivre-lusigny-sur-barse-a8257731.html">forbidden</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A French baker was fined €3,000 (£2,650) for working too hard after he kept his bakery open seven days a week during the summer of 2017.</p>
<p>Cedric Vaivre, 41, broke the country&#8217;s labour rules by keeping the only bakery in the town of Lusigny-sur-Barse open to serve tourists.</p></blockquote>
<p>The more people work, the more wealth is created for the government to expropriate. But that&#8217;s economics, which moonbats cannot grasp. They believe that wealth is a static pie that dropped from the sky, and people who work too hard will get more than their fair share.</p>

<div class="entry">
				<p>The Cult of Intersectionality requires of its devotees and of everyone else the <a target="_blank" href="https://hotair.com/archives/2018/03/14/professor-points-men-taller-women-average-sjws-storm-angrily/">rejection of objective reality</a> — including even its more obvious features:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Previously,] I wrote about <a target="_blank" href="https://hotair.com/archives/2018/03/04/portland-state-university-panel-discussion-intersectionality-religion/">a panel discussion</a> that took place at Portland State University on the topic of intersectionality as a religion. That panel was actually a follow-up of sorts to another event at the school featuring ex-Google engineer James Damore. I knew about the earlier event but, until yesterday, I hadn’t seen this amazing moment that took place during that discussion. At the mention of a simple anatomical fact (men are on average taller than women) a group of SJW’s got up and stormed out, apparently damaging the sound system on the way to the lobby.</p>
<p>The speaker you’ll see here is biology professor Heather Heying, wife of professor Bret Weinstein. Both Heying and Weinstein left Evergreen State College as part of <a target="_blank" href="https://hotair.com/archives/2017/09/18/evergreen-state-college-settles-professors-lawsuit-500000/">a settlement deal</a> last year.</p></blockquote>
<p>As readers will <a target="_blank" href="http://moonbattery.com/mob-sets-upon-professor-for-not-thinking-whites-should-be-abolished-from-campus-for-the-day/">recall</a>, Weinstein was <a target="_blank" href="http://moonbattery.com/evergreen-states-bret-weinstein-sues-for-millions-over-hostile-work-environment/">driven out</a> by a fascist mob for not agreeing that all white people should be periodically banished from the campus. </p>
<blockquote><p>Heying was making a point about physiological differences between men and women. “Are men taller than women on average?” Heying asked rhetorically. She added, “Does anyone take offense at that fact?”</p></blockquote>
<p>A group of offended moonbats promptly got up and stormed out, one of them grousing in the lobby that “Even the women in there have been brainwashed.”</p>
<p>Women who believe that men tend to be taller have been &#8220;brainwashed.&#8221; Only those who embrace liberal ideology in all of its absurdity think for themselves. Free-thinkers are required to believe that there is no difference between men and women except that men are bad, unless the men are women, in which case they must not be criticized in any way.</p>
<p>This is what countermoonbats are up against:</p>

				<p>Maniacs target schools in part because they are less likely to encounter resistance in gun-free zones, so arming some teachers would help prevent school shootings. But there is a problem: teachers might shoot students of politically preferred pigmentation out of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/susan-jones/sen-kamala-harris-if-teachers-are-armed-they-should-be-trained-implicit">sheer racism</a>.

<p>The FBI has come in for a lot of criticism lately, but it must be said that Acting Deputy Director David Bowdich did a remarkable job of refraining from bursting into laughter at the staggering stupidity of Harris&#8217; moonbat posturing. However, the country might be better off if he had given in to the natural urge, rather than treating her pernicious B.S. as if it constituted rational thought.</p>

<div class="entry">
				<p>Five-times-deported illegal alien Jose Garcia Zarate got off with <a target="_blank" href="http://moonbattery.com/kate-steinles-killer-sentenced-to-time-served/">time served</a> after killing Kate Steinle in front of an audience in San Francisco. Now he faces federal charges for being a felon and illegal alien in possession of a firearm. His legal representation counterattacks by playing the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/16/illegal-immigrant-acquitted-in-steinle-killing-accuses-feds-vindictive-prosecution.html">illegal alien card</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Garcia Zarate] is accusing the federal government of “vindictive prosecution and collusion” in its decision to pursue further charges against him. …</p>
<p>&#8220;The true federal interest in pursuing this prosecution is to punish and make an example out of Mr. Garcia-Zarate for his high-profile acquittal in state court,&#8221; the motion reads. &#8220;This prosecution seeks to demonstrate to any high-profile defendant, especially one that is an undocumented immigrant, that their successful exercise of due process rights will not be respected and will result in the heavy hammer of a federal prosecution.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>How dare they discriminate against an &#8220;undocumented&#8221; immigrant by expecting him to obey the law, as if he were a mere American citizen like Kate Steinle?</p>
<p>Discarding any semblance of seriousness, the suit alleges that the killer&#8217;s oppression is a consequence of collusion between the federal government and the State of California. California proclaims itself to be a &#8220;sanctuary state&#8221; that does not cooperate with the federal government on even basic matters regarding immigration enforcement. This stance on the part of local officials is why he was running around loose when he killed Kate Steinle, an ICE detainer request having been ignored.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Garcia Zarate&#8217;s suit may succeed if it comes before a sufficiently liberal judge.</p>

<blockquote><p>Volkswagen has been ordered by a German court to reinstate a suspected Islamist militant it fired over fears he might launch a terrorist attack on the company.</p>
<p>Samir B., 30, worked as a tyre fitter at Volkswagen&#8217;s plant in Wolfsburg, 55miles east of Hanover, and was fired in 2016 after threatening co-workers and pledging to join ISIS in Syria.</p></blockquote>
<p>His threats were credible:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two of Samir B&#8217;s known associates had travelled to Syria in 2014 to join ISIS and were later killed fighting for the Islamist terrorist organisation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Authorities confiscated his passport so that he couldn&#8217;t travel to Syria to fight for ISIS. Reportedly, he was involved in recruiting jihadists locally and told his coworkers they would &#8220;all die.&#8221; So naturally the government forces Volkswagen to employ him.</p>

<div class="entry">
				<p>The media and the education establishment have advanced their shared agenda recently by egging on students to protest against our right to bear arms rather than attend class. The point is to portray these Astroturf protests as spontaneous expressions of the righteous rage of innocent youth. Actually, the protests were organized by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theblaze.com/video/nationwide-student-walkout-organized-by-the-womens-march-set-to-take-place-this-week">same professional ultraleft agitators</a> who staged the pussy hat marches. Would educrats give students leave to cut classes for a cause that is not left-wing? A high school teacher in Rocklin, California who asked this question received a definitive answer when she was placed on <a target="_blank" href="https://reason.com/blog/2018/03/15/national-school-walkout-abortion-guns">administrative leave</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Julianne Benzel <a target="_blank" href="http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2018/03/14/rocklin-teacher-questions-walkout/">told CBS13</a> that she suspects she got in trouble for suggesting that schools administrators who condoned the student walkout might be practicing a double standard.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so I just kind of used the example which I know it&#8217;s really controversial, but I know it was the best example I thought of at the time,&#8221; said Benzel. &#8220;[If] a group of students nationwide, or even locally, decided &#8216;I want to walk out of school for 17 minutes&#8217; and go in the quad area and protest abortion, would that be allowed by our administration?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her students saw her point, and the discussion—which took place last week—was fruitful, according to Benzel. But on Wednesday, the teacher received a call that she had been placed on leave.</p></blockquote>
<p>School officials confirmed that she was in hot water for her &#8220;communications regarding today&#8217;s student-led [yeah right] civic engagement activities.&#8221; </p>
<p>Pointing out that the emperor is naked is good for society, but not for your career if you work in education. You are not supposed to teach kids to think. You are supposed to teach them that if they dutifully regurgitate leftist dogma, they will receive a pat on the head and maybe even 15 minutes of fame like David Hogg.</p>

<div class="entry">
				<p>The liberal establishment promotes miscegenation and chemosurgical transsexual transformations at every turn. But we have not reached peak political correctness. It can be pushed <a target="_blank" href="https://pjmedia.com/faith/push-make-human-chimp-hybrids/">ever further</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><a target="_blank" href="http://nautil.us/issue/58/self/its-time-to-make-human_chimp-hybrids">In a long article</a> adapted from a chapter in his forthcoming book, psychologist David Barash proposes that society should sanction the making of human-chimp hybrids. He refers to this new creature as a &#8220;humanzee&#8221; and says that &#8220;making it would be a terrific idea.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The motive for wanting to create such a blasphemous horror is exactly what you would expect — pure moonbattery:</p>
<blockquote><p>His main argument for pursuing the creation of a human-chimp hybrid is based on the belief that humans have an unwarranted belief that we are special creatures. As Barash puts it, &#8220;Moreover, I propose that the fundamental take-home message of such creation would be to drive a stake into the heart of that destructive disinformation campaign of discontinuity, of human hegemony over all other living things.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Liberals opposed to American exceptionalism elected Barack Obama to bring down the USA a notch or two. Barash wants to do the same for the human race. After a race of humanzees has been created, the logical next step will be to bring down primates, then to bring down mammals, then to bring down vertebrates, then to bring down animals…</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t like Barash&#8217;s plan, you must be a racist:</p>
<blockquote><p>This argumentation claims that the dehumanization of others, what we call racism, is allowed because we&#8217;ve provided an empty space between the value of humans and the lesser value of animals. Close that gap, Barash believes, and racism will truly begin to be wiped out.</p></blockquote>
<p>Best of all, from the progressive point of view, human-animal hybrids would make a mockery of the Bible.</p>
<p>The farther you go down the path of political correctness, the sicker it gets.</p>

				<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/google-ramps-up-demonetizing-dangerous-lifesite-articles">LifeSiteNews</a> has experienced the ire of the Ministry of Truth — a.k.a. Google:</p>
<blockquote><p>Google, the world’s most popular internet tool, has removed revenue-generating ads from select LifeSiteNews reports after it deemed that some of the content on the pro-life and pro-family website violated Google standards.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stories that were regarded as unacceptable by Google included a woman reporting on the sexual abuse she experienced growing up in an LGBT home, a piece featuring a baby born prematurely and looking conspicuously human, one with a video of another conspicuously human fetus still in the amniotic sac, and a story with no images of a baby born alive after an abortion failed.</p>
<p>Evidently, anything likely to tug heartstrings in a direction not to Google&#8217;s ultraleft liking is subject to ad restrictions.</p>
<p>These days it is difficult to get anywhere online without Google. The company is aware of its power and does not hesitate to exploit it to advance an ideology that is pernicious and depraved. This places an insalutary spin on the entire Internet.</p>

<div class="entry">
				<p>Dig far enough down into a Baltimore Sun article about Anne Arundel County NAACP President Rev. Stephen Tillett and other moonbats screeching at a press conference about the oppression of Persons of Politically Preferred Pigmentation at Chesapeake High School in Pasadena, Maryland, and you will find that the spectacle was apparently based on a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/anne-arundel/ac-cn-naacp-schools-0314-story.html">hate hoax</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The news conference followed a threatening post made Feb. 26 against the school specifically targeting black students.</p>
<p>Lt. Ryan Frashure, Anne Arundel County police spokesman, said investigators have identified the student who posted that threat — an African-American student who was charged as a juvenile with disrupting school activities.</p></blockquote>
<p>The unnamed student&#8217;s motives are not known, but the cultural Marxist motives of the moonbats who took his threatening post and ran with it are obvious.</p>
<p>They would have preferred to base the NAACP spectacle on a hate crime committed by a Caucasian. But since those don&#8217;t happen very often, they had to make do.</p>
<p>The important thing is that this allowed demagogues to raise awareness:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tillett … also discussed disparity in achievement and discipline for minority students compared to whites in Anne Arundel County Public Schools.</p>
<p>About 18 percent of African-American students passed the 2017 PARCC Algebra 1 exam countywide, compared to 26.9 percent of Hispanic students passed, 55.7 percent of white students passed and 64.2 percent of Asian students.</p></blockquote>
<p>One reason blacks perform so poorly is that they behave poorly:</p>
<blockquote><p>The federal Department of Education’s Civil Rights Data Collection shows figures from 2013 indicating that while 21 percent of the system’s student population was black, they comprised 44 percent of suspensions.</p></blockquote>
<p>The stats above are presented as evidence that the problem is white people, who are racist.</p>
<p>For staging this farce, the Anne Arundel County NAACP earns a spot on the <a target="_blank" href="http://moonbattery.com/links/Hate-Hoax-List.html">Hate Hoax List</a>.</p>

<div class="entry">
				<p>Why is homelessness getting to be such a problem on the Left Coast? Moonbat-ruled <a target="_blank" href="http://portlandtribune.com/pt/9-news/388960-279777-council-renters-yes-apartment-tower-no">Portland</a> helps demonstrate. Unanimously imposed by the City Council:</p>
<blockquote><p>The renter protection policy requires landlords to pay relocation costs ranging from $2,900 to $4,500 to tenants subject to no-cost evictions or who choose to move if their rents are raised more than 10 percent a year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rent will have to rise by enough to cover this. Otherwise, how are landlords expected to stay in business?</p>
<p>In another unanimous decision, the City Council…</p>
<blockquote><p>…turned down a proposal to build hundreds of more apartments in the Pearl District. Although they would have been in a high-end 17-story tower, economists argue that increasing the total supply of housing will help bring costs down.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, creating more housing units lowers the cost of housing. But if liberals grasped basic principles of economics, they would not be liberals.</p>
<p>The new apartments were nixed for allegedly infringing upon a greenway. Similar priorities prevail in California, resulting in housing prices and the homeless rate exploiting in tandem.</p>
<p>That is a major reason California has the <a target="_blank" href="http://moonbattery.com/moonbat-infested-california-has-nations-lowest-ranking-for-quality-of-life/">lowest quality of life in the nation</a>. The same ideology will produce the same results up the coast.</p>

<blockquote><p>Students left school in an apparently protest for gun control at the high school, but videos posted on Facebook shows a group ripping down the American flag from a flagpole and stomping on it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Considering that the whole point of hijacking Parkland to attack gun rights is to undermine the Constitution that defines the country, desecrating Old Glory was highly appropriate.</p>

<p>Police represent the old order. When the new one has been imposed, no one will dare attack police cars.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://moonbattery.com/south-african-rivers-reduced-to-sewers/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to South African Rivers Reduced to Sewers">South African Rivers Reduced to Sewers</a></h2>
<div class="entry">
				<p>If moonbats cared about the environment as much as they say, they would be less pleased with their handiwork in South Africa. International political correctness pressured the formerly advanced country into submitting to black rule. The consequences have been horrific not only for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/world-economy/bury-them-alive-white-south-africans-fear-for-their-future-as-horrific-farm-attacks-escalate/news-story/3a63389a1b0066b6b0b77522c06d6476">white farmers</a>, but also for the <a target="_blank" href="https://rekordcenturion.co.za/140555/a-river-of-despair/">Hennops River</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Plastic bags, used toilet paper discarded pieces of cloth and all kinds of rubbish are hanging from tree branches.</p>
<p>There seemed to be no attempt in the pipeline to restore the river, said resident Charl Niehaus. …</p>
<p>“Many years ago, it was a river everybody was proud of. You could swim, have picnics and walk along the river,” he remembered.</p>
<p>“Today it is a filthy, stinking river of sewerage, which seriously threatens the environment and human lives.”</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the quaint and colorful customs that set apart the Third World is the habit of dumping waste directly into rivers.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.politicsweb.co.za/news-and-analysis/medical-waste-flowing-into-letaba-river--da">Letaba River</a> has suffered a similar fate:</p>
<blockquote><p>The DA found human excretion, blood, toxic waste and other dangerous medical waste spewing from the [Letaba Hospital] directly into the Letaba River. This is due to the pump station, which is supposed to pump toxic waste to a purifying plant, not being operational for over six months. …</p>
<p>The reason for the inactive pump station is allegedly the result of Eskom removing the breakers for the pump station last year, rendering it useless. This is apparently due to the excessive debts owed to Eskom by the Mopani District Municipality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds like government mismanagement. It set in like a terminal case of tuberculosis with the end of Apartheid in 1994.</p>
<blockquote><p>The stench from the river due to the waste is unbearable. Surgical gloves, bandages and […] countless other waste litters the river.</p>
<p>Less than 200 meters down the river from the hospital, people were bathing and further down a water truck was found pumping water out of the river, possibly to sell to people in the area.</p></blockquote>
<p>For some reason, the same international media that was all over South Africa like ants on a picnic prior to 1994 seems uninterested in this opportunity to expose crimes against Gaia.</p>
<p>Those who live there aren&#8217;t able to avoid the situation by ignoring it. In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/western-cape/blocked-sewer-causes-uproar-as-poo-water-flows-into-homes-13753658">Cape Town</a>, the sewage comes right into their homes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Resident Mpumi Simani, 24, says over the past week residents in Albert Shweni Street (NY28) have had to deal with the stench of raw sewage and resorted to using buckets as they were unable to flush their toilets.</p>
<p>“The drain was overflowing and the water pushed up into our yards. We could not use our toilet for almost a week because the water would not go down, so we had to use buckets and it is very unhealthy,” Mpumi says.</p>
<p>“I contacted the City of Cape Town and they said we must wait for 48 hours, but we waited longer than that. This is not the first time this has happened and it started at the beginning of the year. Every time they fix it and it just happens again.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Mpumi is advised to get used to it. <a target="_blank" href="http://moonbattery.com/race-war-impends-in-south-africa/">Driving out the last whites</a> will not improve the situation.</p>
