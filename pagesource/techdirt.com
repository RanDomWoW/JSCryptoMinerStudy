<p>
We recently wrote about an important <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180307/03532139374/top-court-throws-out-corporate-sovereignty-all-trade-deals-within-eu-those-involving-other-nations-likely-to-suffer-same-fate.shtml">judgment</a> from the EU's top court, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The ruling said that that corporate sovereignty provisions included in trade deals between the EU's member states were illegal. Significantly, the logic behind that decision suggests that <em>any</em> form of investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) -- the official name for the corporate sovereignty framework -- even in trade deals involving countries outside the EU, would be forbidden too. <a href="https://www.uva.nl/profiel/e/c/c.eckes/c.eckes.html">Christina Eckes</a>, professor of European law at the University of Amsterdam and director of the Amsterdam Centre for European Law and Governance, believes that the <a href="http://europeanlawblog.eu/2018/03/13/dont-lead-with-your-chin-if-member-states-continue-with-the-ratification-of-ceta-they-violate-european-union-law/">implications of the CJEU ruling are even broader</a>.
</p>
<p>
Eckes says that in the wake of the judgment, serious doubts hang over the investment chapter in the Canada-EU trade deal, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=ceta">CETA</a>, which has still not been ratified by all EU member states yet -- a process that is <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170215/07332936717/canada-eu-trade-deal-ratified-european-union-now-needs-approval-all-member-states-national-parliaments.shtml">necessary</a> before it comes into force definitively. In fact, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20161027/09490835898/eu-canada-trade-deal-dodges-belgian-veto-now-faces-multiple-legal-challenges.shtml">Belgium</a> has explicitly asked the CJEU to rule on the legality of the Investor Court System (<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/techdirt%20/?tag=ics">ICS</a>) in CETA, which is the modified version of corporate sovereignty that supposedly addresses its flaws. As a result, a ruling on whether CETA's investment chapter is legal is definitely on its way, and could have major implications for CETA and its ratification. However, Ecke points out that there is something called "EU loyalty", which:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
requires that Member States amongst others '<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:12016M004&#038;from=EN">facilitate the achievement of the Union's tasks and refrain from any measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the Union's objectives</a>.' In external relations, they are obliged not to undermine the EU’s external actions and ensure unity in international representation. ... Furthermore, EU loyalty covers not just the present state of EU law but also ‘the foreseeable future development of EU law’ and should hence be interpreted as requiring certain actions or omissions in the present in order to avoid a potential future conflict between international legal obligations and EU law.
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
What this means in practice, Eckes suggests, is that the EU's member states should not go ahead and ratify CETA without knowing the outcome of the CJEU deliberation on the legality of the ICS. If they were to complete ratification, and the investment chapter were then found inadmissible by the court, this would undermine the authority of the CJEU, since its ruling would be null and void. As a consequence, she says:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
In the light of the foreseeable risk that CJEU declares the CETA investment chapter to be capable of undermining the autonomy of the EU legal order, Member States are required by the principle of EU loyalty to halt ratification in order to demonstrate a uniform position as one Party, together with the EU and the other Member States, on the international plane in general and vis-&agrave;-vis Canada in particular.
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
It's an interesting argument, which the European Commission will doubtless do its best to ignore in the hope that it can just steamroller CETA through the ratification process before the CJEU issues its ruling. However, if, as seems likely, CETA's investment chapter is indeed ruled illegal by the top court, this will present a rather thorny problem for the EU. Given the other challenges it faces thanks to rising populism in many EU countries, the Commission could probably do without this kind of constitutional crisis that would undermine further people's support for the European project. That might be a good reason for putting those ratifications on hold for a while.

<p>
Buzzfeed has obtained files the NYPD never wanted the public to see. This isn't the result of a protracted public records battle, but rather the work of an anonymous whistleblower. Presumably, those further up the chain of command are already familiar with the department's disinterest in holding officers accountable, so there's no whistleblowing outlet there. Also, presumably, the Civilian Complaint Review Board's hands are tied and it cannot hand out disciplinary reports for officers never formally disciplined. So, leak it is. <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/kendalltaggart/secret-nypd-files-hundreds-of-officers-committed-serious?utm_term=.lmYVZAV1Oa#.osaewLeKZo" target="_blank">And what a leak it is</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>Secret files obtained by BuzzFeed News reveal that from 2011 to 2015 at least 319 New York Police Department employees who committed offenses serious enough to merit firing were allowed to keep their jobs.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Many of the officers lied, cheated, stole, or assaulted New York City residents. At least fifty employees lied on official reports, under oath, or during an internal affairs investigation. Thirty-eight were found guilty by a police tribunal of excessive force, getting into a fight, or firing their gun unnecessarily. Fifty-seven were guilty of driving under the influence. Seventy-one were guilty of ticket-fixing. One officer, Jarrett Dill, threatened to kill someone. Another, Roberson Tunis, sexually harassed and inappropriately touched a fellow officer. Some were guilty of lesser offenses, like mouthing off to a supervisor.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>At least two dozen of these employees worked in schools. Andrew Bailey was found guilty of touching a female student on the thigh and kissing her on the cheek while she was sitting in his car. In a school parking lot, while he was supposed to be on duty, Lester Robinson kissed a woman, removed his shirt, and began to remove his pants. And Juan Garcia, while off duty, illegally sold prescription medication to an undercover officer.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>In every instance, the police commissioner, who has final authority in disciplinary decisions, assigned these officers to &ldquo;dismissal probation,&rdquo; a penalty with few practical consequences. The officer continues to do their job at their usual salary. They may get less overtime and won&rsquo;t be promoted during that period, which usually lasts a year. When the year is over, so is the probation.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There's an NYPD Snowden out there somewhere, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150908/19411432200/citizen-complaint-board-finds-public-their-cellphones-are-foisting-some-accountability-nypd.shtml">exposing the dirty non-secret</a> that is the continued lack of accountability within the largest police force in the nation. New York's Finest, the NYPD calls itself, ignoring the fact that it does almost nothing to ensure it's only staffed with the finest human beings.
</p>
<p>
Sure, 319 out of 40,000 officers is only a small percentage, but there's nothing in Buzzfeed's blockbuster article that indicates what it's seen is <em>all</em> that's available. What it <em>has</em> seen is only a small part of a larger whole. These are the probation files, which don't include officers dismissed. Add that to the mix and the total rises to over 1,400 officers caught breaking laws and policies -- many of which were allowed to resign while charges were still pending, keeping their records clean and their pension plans intact.
</p>
<p>
This expos&eacute; of kid glove treatment for repeat offenders contains this PR-friendly statement from the deputy commissioner of the office charged with handling internal disciplinary issues. Kevin Richardson, speaking on behalf of the job he's failing to do, made assertions clearly contradicted by the documents in Buzzfeed's possession.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>&ldquo;The department is not interested in terminating officers that don't need to be terminated. We're interested in keeping employees and making our employees obey the rules and do the right thing,&rdquo; he told BuzzFeed News. &ldquo;But where there are failings that we realize this person should be separated from the department, this police commissioner and the prior police commissioner have shown a willingness to do that.&rdquo;</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
From what's being reported here, "separating" someone from the department is a last resort. And when it is done, it's often done in a way that allows bad officers to move on to other police departments or sit at home collecting a pension for a job <s>well</s> poorly done. Richardson is in denial, but at least he's a bit more reasonable than the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>Al O&rsquo;Leary, a spokesperson for the Patrolmen&rsquo;s Benevolent Association, the largest police union representing NYPD officers, had a different message: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to talk to you about anything negative as far as any of our officers.&rdquo;</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Well, if you won't, others will. Burying your head in the filthy sand doesn't make the problem go away. And it certainly doesn't put an entity willing to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150916/05271332270/nypd-union-prez-patrick-lynch-only-police-are-qualified-to-judge-actions-police.shtml">stand up for any officer</a>, no matter how egregious their misconduct, in a better light.
</p>
<p>
Case in point: Officer Raymond Marrero. Marrero is still employed by the NYPD despite being named in four serious complaints in his first six years and racking up $900,000 of lawsuit settlements. This colorful story is just one of Marrero's many abusive escapades.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>[I]n early 2009, a former police department volunteer named Louis Deluca confronted a man who, Deluca found out, had groped his brother&rsquo;s 17-year-old girlfriend. The man took off with his friends, just as Marrero was pulling up. &ldquo;I was telling him, 'There's some guys that groped a family member of mine,&rsquo;&rdquo; Deluca said. &ldquo;&lsquo;They're right around the corner.&rsquo;&rdquo;</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Marrero and his partner told Deluca to shut up, Deluca said. Incredulous, Deluca called Marrero a cunt. The officers pushed him to the ground and arrested him, according to a lawsuit Deluca later filed.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Back at the precinct, as Deluca was being taken out of the car, Marrero struck him with his police baton, opening up a gash on the top of his head. Another officer said there was so much blood, they had to clean it up with a mop. It took 12 staples at the hospital to close the wound.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>In a deposition, Deluca said Marrero told him &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t disrespect us in the street like that.&rdquo; Deluca received a $398,000 <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4390427-DELUCA-SETTLEMENT.html" target="_blank">settlement</a>, of which Marrero was ordered to pay $4,000.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Marrero pled guilty to several internal charges during this six-year period, including deploying excessive force and lying to department investigators. Despite this, Commissioner Ray Kelly felt Marrero still added value to the force. He was placed on probation and lost 45 vacation days, but was never terminated or asked to resign. An outside commission on police corruption reviewed these files and suggested Marrero be fired, as he "lacked the temperament necessary to be a police officer." This suggestion was ignored.
</p>
<p>
There's nothing about local laws or NYPD policies that encourage any sort of positive change. The NYPD says local laws allow it to withhold disciplinary records from the public. Disciplinary trials for officers are open to the public&hellip; so to speak. They're held without prior announcement of schedules or locations. They're presided over by a police official appointed by the NYPD Commissioner, rather than a neutral adjudicator. And if a top cop decides an accused cop should be terminated, the Commissioner can overturn the ruling. (And even if the Commissioner allowed the discipline to stay in place, there's a good chance the PBA would get the ruling overturned.)
</p>

A closed disciplinary does no favors for the public. Unsurprisingly, it does no favors for police officers, either. Bad cops become worse cops as no one's willing to engage in serious deterrence and the system itself is often used to retaliate against good cops who blow the whistle on bad behavior or sue the department for discriminatory practices. Ultimately, no one's accountable to anyone, despite everyone involved being a public servant.

This leak will likely provoke some changes within the department, but with zero oversight, the positive changes likely won't last. My money's on an internal investigation into the leak being the largest expenditure of time and effort as a result of this expos&eacute;.

<p>
In all of our conversations about video game piracy and the DRM that studios and publishers use to try to stave it off, the common refrain from those within in the industry and others is that these cracking groups are nearly nihilism personified. Nothing is sacred to these people, goes the mantra, and they care nothing for the gaming industry at all. If the gaming industry is destroyed, it will be because of these pirate-y pirates simply not giving a damn.
</p>
<p>
This notion is belied by the story of Crackshell, makers of indie spinoff of the <em>Serious Sam</em> franchise called <em>Serious Sam's Bogus Detour</em>, and Voksi, an individual that runs a game-cracking ring. Voksi has been <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171101/09271938528/with-denuvo-broken-ubisoft-doubles-up-drm-assasins-creed-origin-tanking-everyones-computers.shtml">featured</a> in our pages before as one of the few people out there who has been able to consistently defeat the Denuvo DRM, helping propel the software's <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=denuvo">precipitous fall</a> from grace. If a game developer and a game-cracker seem to be natural enemies, it will come as a surprise to you that <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/voksi-pirates-new-serious-sam-game-with-permission-from-developers-180312/">they have recently teamed up</a> to try to resurrect <em>Bogus Detour</em> from the bin of failure.
</p>
<p>
The whole story is useful for debunking the notion that these pirate sites and those that run them are pure venom for the game industry, but it's particularly useful to hear how this relationship came to be.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>In discussion with TF over the weekend, Voksi told us that he&rsquo;s a huge fan of the Serious Sam franchise so when he found out about the latest title &ndash; Serious Sam&rsquo;s Bogus Detour (SSBD) &ndash; he wanted to play it &ndash; badly. That led to a remarkable series of events.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>&ldquo;One month before the game&rsquo;s official release I got into the closed beta, thanks to a friend of mine, who invited me in. I introduced myself to the developers [Crackshell]. I told them what I do for a living, but also assured them that I didn&rsquo;t have any malicious intents towards the game. They were very cool about it, even surprisingly cool,&rdquo; Voksi informs TF.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
When the game hit the market, Voksi didn't target it. Despite this hands-off approach from a capable game-cracker, sales for the title were very poor. Reviews on Steam were great, critics generally liked it, and yet as of the end of 2017 the game wasn't even profitable. Bucking the stereotype, Voksi reached out to Crackshell and offered to help.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>&ldquo;Last week I contacted the main dev of SSBD over Steam and proposed what I can do to help boost the game. He immediately agreed,&rdquo; Voksi says.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>&ldquo;The plan was to release a build of the game that was playable from start to finish, playable in co-op with up to 4 players, not to miss anything important gameplay wise and add a little message in the bottom corner, which is visible at all times, telling you: &ldquo;We are small indie studio. If you liked the game, please consider buying it. Thank you and enjoy the game!&rdquo;</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Voksi, who is doing all of this for free, then went on to tie in giveaways for the pirate version of the game <a href="https://revolt.group/index.php?/topic/7743-serious-sams-bogus-detour-and-heroes-of-the-hammerwatch-giveaway-challenge/">on his own forum for his cracking group</a>. This work, done pro bono, is all the result of Voksi liking the game, liking the developer, and desperately wanting both to succeed. If ever there were a rebuttal to the notion of pirate groups as nihilistic and selfish, this is certainly it.
</p>
<p>
This whole experiment will also serve as a wonderful test of how useful engaging the supposed enemies of gaming by studios would be. Keep in mind that this game was already a failure in terms of being profitable, despite being a good game by all accounts. If engaging with pirate groups and sites can suddenly make it profitable? Well, that would seem to turn even more claims about piracy on their head.

<p>
A chief federal judge in Chicago has handed down a scathing opinion calling ATF stash house stings an "ends justifies the means" evil that needs to be "relegated to the dark corridors of our past." The opinion shuts the door on two defendants hoping to show the ATF's fake robberies of fake stash houses filled with fake drugs were racially-biased, but it does show even without the taint of bias, the sting operations are exploitative and useless. (via <a href="https://twitter.com/bradheath/status/973232672951685121" target="_blank">Brad Heath</a>)
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4406953/Stash-House-Opinion.pdf" target="_blank">opinion</a> [PDF] has nothing good to say about the stash house stings. It opens with numbers that certainly appear to show racial bias and it doesn't let up from there.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>It is undisputed that between 2006 and 2013, the defendants charged in this District in the ATF false stash house cases were 78.7 black, 9.6 percent Hispanic, and 11.7 percent white. During this same period, the District's adult population was approximately 18 percent black, 11 percent Hispanic, and 63 percent White. <strong>These numbers generate great disrespect for law enforcement efforts</strong>. Disrespect for the law cannot be tolerated during these difficult times. It is time for false stash house cases to end and be relegated to the dark corridors of our past. <strong>To put it simply, our criminal justice system should not tolerate false stash house cases in 2018</strong>.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>[...]</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Our society simply cannot accept a "win at all costs" mentality in the delicate world of law enforcement, which is ultimately dependent on proactive citizen involvement.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The judge then goes on to speak about the valuable work of taking firearms off the streets, but says that this job cannot, and should not, be performed through bogus sting operations -- even in an era where gun violence is seemingly more prevalent. Even when violence against citizens and (especially) law enforcement was at its peak nearly 100 years ago, the ATF never stooped to using complete bullshit to secure a steady stream of criminal defendants.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em><strong>[E]ven during the low points of the great violence caused by the alcohol wars of Prohibition, the ATP did not seek to use "false alcohol warehouse" tactics against any ethnic organized crime groups to promote public safety</strong>. Instead, the ATP used solid investigative work to garner the great public respect of the Elliot Ness era that still lives today as the gold standard of law enforcement. This type of work inspires great public cooperation with law enforcement, unlike the false drug stash house cases before the Court.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Judge Ruben Castillo notes that many ATF sting cases -- like the two before him -- operate under the theory that roping in otherwise uninvolved citizens will somehow result in the seizure of illegal weapons. Some cases, obviously, do result in weapons being taken off the streets. <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171029/16431538509/another-stash-house-sting-criticized-court-lengthy-sentences-left-untouched.shtml">Far more often</a>, the only thing taken off the streets are people with little in the way of criminal records or cash, talked into taking down a fake stash house for a cut of a completely fabricated drugs and money. The fake amounts of drugs in the fake stash house are used to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160809/14081135202/judge-says-stash-house-sting-operations-allow-prosecutors-to-be-judge-jury-executioner.shtml">determine sentence lengths</a>, with the ATF asserting -- without exception -- that the quantity of make-believe drugs discussed with sting victims is enough to trigger 20-year minimum sentences.
</p>
<p>
The judge points out that the government is lucky he's only considering the issues raised by the defendants: alleged Fifth Amendment violations predicated on the apparent bias in the ATF's stash house sting operations. Much of the 73-page opinion discussed expert opinions based on studies of the underlying facts of a decade's-worth of stash house stings. Some evidence of discriminatory selection exists, but it's undercut by most DEA stings being predicated on tips from confidential informants. In other words, maybe CI's are bigoted, but the operations themselves are not, despite a large percentage of defendants being minorities.
</p>
<p>
The trials of these two defendants will continue. But the concerns expressed by the judge suggest the ATF is no longer welcome to bring stash house sting prosecutions into Judge Castillo's court. This is only one judge of hundreds in the federal system, but it's another federal judiciary voice to add to those who've already expressed concern, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140319/07345226624/judge-otis-wright-slams-made-up-government-plot-designed-to-ensnare-gullible-non-criminals.shtml">if not actual dismay</a>, at the ATF's sting operations.

It's become quite fashionable these days to gripe about the Internet. Even some of its <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tech/2018/03/13/today-senate-telecom-subcommittee-scrutinizes-broadband-129947">staunchest allies in Congress have been getting cranky</a>. Naturally there are going to be growing pains as humanity adapts to the unprecedented ability for billions of people to communicate with each other easily, cheaply, and immediately for the first time in world history. But this communications revolution has also brought some extraordinary benefits that we glibly risk when we forget about them and instead only focus the challenges. This glass is way more than half full but, if we're not careful to protect it, soon it will be empty.

As we've been talking about a lot recently, working its way through Congress is a bill, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=sesta">SESTA/FOSTA</a>, so fixated on perceived problems with the Internet (even though there's <a href=" https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170925/16401838283/sesta-is-being-pushed-as-answer-to-sex-trafficking-epidemic-that-simply-doesnt-exist.shtml">no evidence that these are problems the Internet itself caused</a>) that it <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180226/07321339304/section-230-isnt-about-facebook-about-you.shtml">threatens the ability</a> of the Internet to <a href=" https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171110/09353838586/wikipedia-warns-that-sesta-could-destroy-wikipedia.shtml">deliver its benefits</a>, including those that <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180227/15314039324/doj-tells-congress-sesta-fosta-will-make-it-more-difficult-to-catch-traffickers-house-votes-it-anyway.shtml">would better provide tools</a> to deal with some of those perceived problems, if not outright <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180314/00004839422/sex-workers-survivors-raising-alarm-about-sesta-it-will-literally-put-their-lives-danger.shtml">make those same problems worse by taking away the Internet's ability to help</a>. But it won't be the last such bill, as long as the regulatory pile-on <em><a href=" https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180110/02432738974/senator-portman-promises-to-pass-bills-to-harm-tech-companies-if-they-wont-support-sesta.shtml">intending</a></em> to disable the Internet is allowed to proceed unchecked.
</p>
<p>
As the saying too often goes, you don't know what you've got till it's gone. But this time let's not wait to lose it; let's take the opportunity to appreciate all the good the Internet has given us, so we can hold on tight to it and resist efforts to take it away.
</p>
<p>
Towards that end, we want to encourage the sharing and collection of examples of how the Internet has made the world better: how it made it better for everyone, and how it even just made it better for you, and whether it made things better for good, or for even just one moment in one day when the Internet enabled some connection, discovery, or opportunity that could not have happened without it. It is unlikely that this list could be exhaustive: the Internet delivers its benefits too frequently and often too seamlessly to easily recognize them all. But that's why it's all the more important to go through the exercise of reflecting on as many as we can, because once they become less frequent and less seamless they will be much easier to miss and much harder to get back.

<p>
The UN has decided it's possibly Facebook's fault things are going so badly in Myanmar. Muslims have been fleeing the country in droves thanks to Myanmar security forces engaging in widespread acts of violence (including rape) against them, urged on by hardline nationalist monks.
</p>
<p>
For all intents and purposes, Facebook is Myanmar's internet. Loosening of restrictions on social media access has resulted in a large portion of the population getting all their news (along with all the hate speech the UN is complaining about) via the social media giant. The UN is looking into genocide accusations <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/13/myanmar-un-blames-facebook-for-spreading-hatred-of-rohingya" target="_blank">but has decided to speak up against Facebook first</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>Marzuki Darusman, chairman of the UN Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, told reporters that social media had played a &ldquo;determining role&rdquo; in Myanmar.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>&ldquo;It has &hellip; substantively contributed to the level of acrimony and dissension and conflict, if you will, within the public. Hate speech is certainly of course a part of that. As far as the Myanmar situation is concerned, social media is Facebook, and Facebook is social media,&rdquo; he said.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>The UN Myanmar investigator Yanghee Lee said Facebook was a huge part of public, civil and private life, and the government used it to disseminate information to the public.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
When there's only one main pipeline of info, everything flows through it, whether it's the official government narrative or government-supported hate speech targeting Myanmar Muslims. The UN feels Facebook has contributed to the violence by not doing enough to remove hate speech.
</p>
<p>
If these are the UN's conclusions, it's severely late to the party. Last fall, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/exclusive-rohingya-activists-say-facebook-silences-them" target="_blank">The Daily Beast reported Facebook was instrumental</a> in removing reports of anti-Muslim violence the Myanmar government didn't approve of.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>Rohingya activists&mdash;in Burma and in Western countries&mdash;tell The Daily Beast that Facebook has been removing their posts documenting the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya people in <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/us-urges-myanmar-to-stop-the-violence-in-rohingya-crackdown" target="_blank">Burma</a> (also known as Myanmar). They said their accounts are frequently suspended or taken down.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>The <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/burmas-nobel-peace-prize-winner-aung-suu-kyi-winks-at-rohingya-massacres" target="_blank">Rohingya</a> people are a Muslim ethnic minority group in Burma. They face extraordinary persecution and violence from the Burmese military; military personnel torch villages, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/07/massacre-at-tula-toli-rohingya-villagers-recall-horror-of-myanmar-army-attack" target="_blank">murder refugees</a>, and force hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Facebook promised to do better after being confronted with this evidence. But it offered no good reason why activists' posts detailing government atrocities were frequently removed and the accounts posting them locked or suspended. The company did not specifically say whether or not it was responding to government requests for content removal, but <a href="https://transparency.facebook.com/country/Myanmar/2017-H1/" target="_blank">its transparency report</a> shows almost no activity related to Myanmar's government. If this was solely the result of horrendous judgment calls by Facebook moderators, the end result of its moderation efforts has been the loss of human lives.
</p>
<p>
Even as Muslims are being silenced, the Myanmar government has used Facebook to push its own narrative to a largely captive audience. Shuna Mia, a Rohingya man who spoke to reporters about government-backed rape and murder was found floating headless in a nearby river the following day. According to this Guardian report, the Myanmar government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/23/aung-san-suu-free-press-fake-news-rohingya" target="_blank">immediately began rewriting history using Facebook as its soapbox</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>The day after Shuna was found dead, someone representing the state counsellor of Myanmar (Aung San Suu Kyi&rsquo;s official title) posted a photo of a headless body on the office&rsquo;s Facebook page, stamped with the words &ldquo;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/state.counsellor/photos/a.792613514206200.1073741827.792607210873497/943693899098160/?type=3&#038;theater" target="_blank">Truth teller BEHEADED</a>&rdquo;. The post claimed Shuna had told the media that security forces had not committed rape or arson, and suggested he was killed by &ldquo;Muslim insurgents&rdquo; in retaliation. That directly contradicted local reports, activists and Shuna&rsquo;s family, who believe he was abducted and beheaded by security forces for speaking to journalists.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>This was just part of the government&rsquo;s efforts to discredit Rohingya people. On the same day, the same Facebook account posted photos of Rohingya women who said they had been raped by security forces. The label &ldquo;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/state.counsellor/photos/a.792613514206200.1073741827.792607210873497/943698079097742/?type=3&#038;theater" target="_blank">FAKE RAPE</a>&rdquo; dismissed the countless reports of sexual violence.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Facebook <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160615/17331334722/facebook-still-deleting-non-offensive-posts-being-offensive.shtml">has always had issues</a> with moderation. Its policies may seem internally consistent, but the way they play out in the messiness of everyday life <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170629/12413937698/facebook-hate-speech-rules-protect-races-sexes-so-yes-white-men-are-going-to-be-protected.shtml">leaves a lot to be desired</a>. The content it removed may have somehow violated policies or local laws, but posts are apparently viewed in vacuum, removed from political and social context. This isn't necessarily an oversight by Facebook. It's merely reflective of the reality the company deals with: more than a billion users scattered across the globe, operating under a patchwork of speech laws that cannot be applied across all posts from all people.
</p>
<p>
But the end result of this impossible task is Facebook's inadvertent participation in the spread of anti-Muslim hate that is linked to suspected ethnic cleansing. Unfortunately, the UN's public criticism of Facebook isn't going to help. If Facebook sees more regulation or international pressure headed its way, it's likely to double-down on moderation, resulting in even more suppression of anti-government sentiment. It will get worse for Myanmar Muslims, thanks to Facebook's inadvertent stranglehold on news distribution.
</p>
<p>
This isn't to say no one should be speaking up about Facebook's contribution to an international problem. It's just that they shouldn't expect things to get better just because they're loudly complaining about it. The problem is the Myanmar government and that's where the UN should focus its efforts. Facebook's contribution is a symptom of the underlying problem, not a root cause.

<p>
Last fall, the Department of Justice announced it would be <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171120/14262838654/right-choice-wrong-reasons-doj-sues-to-kill-att-time-warner-merger.shtml">suing to block AT&#038;T's $86 billion acquisition of Time Warner</a>. According to the DOJ, it sued to block the lawsuit to protect consumers, arguing that the deal would likely make it harder for streaming competitors to license the content they need to compete with AT&#038;T (especially HBO programming). Consumer advocates have long argued that AT&#038;T (with its decade of well-documented and often comedic <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160809/05541335192/att-fined-turning-blind-eye-as-drug-dealers-ripped-off-customers.shtml">anti-consumer behavior</a> in tow) would simply use its greater leverage and power to hamstring competition and jack up rates for consumers (especially with net neutrality dying).
</p>
<p>
While some have argued that the DOJ is simply following antitrust protocol, others (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-13/at-t-is-said-ready-to-probe-white-house-role-on-time-warner-deal">including AT&#038;T lawyers</a>) think the lawsuit is driven by other motivations.
</p>
<p>
That's not a hard case to make given the Trump administration's <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180123/10392939064/fcc-hopes-phony-dedication-to-rural-broadband-will-make-you-forget-it-killed-net-neutrality.shtml">anti-consumer, anti-innovation, and anti-competition</a> tendencies on other fronts (like net neutrality). Trump's pick to head the DOJ's antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, was also on record, before joining the DOJ, stating he <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/3/27/15081294/trump-tech-att-time-warner-antitrust-competition">saw no real problems with the deal</a>. Meanwhile Trump's disdain for Time Warner-owned CNN is also well established, and reports have indicated that Trump pal Rupert Murdoch spent much of last year <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/is-rupert-murdoch-a-hidden-hand-in-the-cnn-merger-meltdown">trying to scuttle the deal</a> for competitive reasons (Muroch has also approached AT&#038;T <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cnn-murdoch-exclusive/exclusive-rupert-murdoch-twice-discussed-cnn-with-att-ceo-sources-idUSKBN1DA2PY">twice</a> about buying CNN).
</p>
<p>
Adding fuel to this fire was a bipartisan group of ex-DOJ officials (from US Attorney Preet Bharara and Nixon White House counsel John Dean) that, last week, <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4406948/73-1.pdf">filed an amicus brief</a> with the court urging an inquiry into whether any potential laws were broken. The brief doesn't even mention Murdoch, and instead focuses on the obvious, inherent problems in scuttling a merger just because the President doesn't like one of the media outlets involved:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"While any improper use of government authority to punish critics or reward supporters would pose a grave threat to our constitutional system, that threat is particularly acute in a situation in which the government uses or appears to use its regulatory authority to punish media entities or others who are critical of the government. Such behavior could chill criticism, endangering the kind of free and open speech and debate that our Founders adopted the First Amendment to protect precisely because it is necessary for self-government."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
While that's true, Bharara's specific objections here are somewhat <em>rich</em> for him personally, given that during his tenure he seized domain names and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110713/00485515074/feds-respond-to-rojadirectas-challenge-to-domain-seizures-if-we-give-it-back-theyll-infringe-again.shtml">refused to return them</a> -- only giving them back once it was abudantly clear he wasn't going to win in court. Bahara's office also issued a gag order over a subpoena to Reason just because a few folks <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150622/17154931426/outrageousness-reason-gag-order.shtml">said some mean things about a Judge</a>.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, hoping to use these concerns to defeat the DOJ lawsuit, AT&#038;T lawyers have been busy <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-13/at-t-is-said-ready-to-probe-white-house-role-on-time-warner-deal">trying to get a hold of evidence</a> proving that the Trump administration pressured the DOJ to try and derail the lawsuit. But late last month Judge Richard J. Leon rejected AT&#038;T's request for detailed email and phone logs between the White House and the Justice Department related to the deal, forcing AT&#038;T to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/technology/att-time-warner-antitrust.html">scuttle that angle</a> of their legal defense. Needless to say, whichever way this ruling goes could have a profound impact on the media, broadband, and advertising markets for years:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
"If the judge sides with AT&#038;T and Time Warner, he would usher in the creation of a new kind of corporate behemoth — one with nationwide reach via wireless and satellite television service that would also have control over a movie studio and channels like HBO, CNN and TNT, which has valuable basketball sports rights.
The company would have a leading position to negotiate licensing deals with rival telecom and media firms. It would also be in a stronger position against fast-growing streaming video services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video."
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Questions over the DOJ's actual motivation here have created an interesting conversation over whether the ends justify the means, even if the motivation is cronyism and not consumer welfare. Whether the deal should be blocked has become increasingly relevant in the wake of the Trump FCC's attack on net neutrality, a move that could open the door to all manner of "creative" efforts by a bigger, more powerful AT&#038;T to hamstring competition in the media space, should the deal be allowed to proceed.
</p>
<p>
All told, we've ironically got the Trump DOJ breathlessly claiming it's trying to protect consumers from a bigger, badder AT&#038;T, while the Trump FCC empowers AT&#038;T to engage in more anti-competitive shenanigans than ever before -- with no sign that anybody in government realizing they're operating at cross purposes if "consumers" really are the driving motivator. The Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit against AT&#038;T and Time Warner, filed back in November, is scheduled to go to trial on March 19.

<p>
We've made the point for a long time that, on a long enough timeline, pretty much everybody is a pirate. The point is that the way copyright laws have evolved alongside such useful tools as the internet makes knowing whether common sense actions are actually copyright infringement an incredibly dicey riddle to solve. Often times without even trying, members of the public engage in infringing activities, up to and including the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120717/13500819733/bmg-doubles-down-issues-takedown-original-clip-obama-singing-al-green.shtml">President</a> of the United States.
</p>
<p>
And, it appears, up to and including entire branches of the United States military, though claims of accidental infringement in this case would appear to be rather silly. Bitmanagement, a German software company that produces virtual reality software, is accusing the US Navy of what can only be described <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-navy-under-fire-in-mass-software-piracy-lawsuit-180312/">as massive levels of copyright infringement</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>In 2011 and 2012, the US Navy began using BS Contact Geo, a 3D virtual reality application developed by German company Bitmanagement. The Navy reportedly agreed to purchase licenses for use on 38 computers, but things began to escalate.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>While Bitmanagement was hopeful that it could sell additional licenses to the Navy, the software vendor soon discovered the US Government had already installed it on 100,000 computers without extra compensation. In a Federal Claims Court complaint filed by Bitmanagement two years ago, that figure later increased to hundreds of thousands of computers. Because of the alleged infringement, Bitmanagement demanded damages totaling hundreds of millions of dollars.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Both parties have since investigated the issue, with the Navy reportedly simply admitting that it installed the software on nearly half a million computers. Bitmanagement had assumed the Navy would be paying for these installations, but the military branch failed to do so and instead tried to work out much lower licensing costs with the company long after the fact. For its part, the government insists that it bought concurrent licenses rather than client licenses, but this defense makes little sense for any number of reasons. The scale of installations suggests that more than 38 users would be on the software at any given time, not to mention that Bitmanagement's VARs are not authorized to sell concurrent licenses, and that nothing in the contracts the Navy agreed to even mentions the word "concurrent."
</p>
<p>
In a request for summary judgement, Bitmanagement is asking for the government to be liable for the hundreds of thousands of installations it carried out and pay for them accordingly.
</p>
<p>
Now, while this infringement by the US government seems anything other than accidental, keep in mind that this same US government that regularly puts out reports and comments on the dastardly amounts of copyright infringement carried out by other foreign governments and their citizens. It seems as though America should get its own house in order, at least at the level of the federal government, before pointing any more fingers.

<p>
Given the sensitive nature of their work, lawyers need to take particular care when communicating online. One way to address this -- quite reasonable, in theory -- is to create a dedicated system with strong security built in. That's the route being taken by Germany's Federal Bar Association (Bundesrechtsanwaltskammer -- BRAK) with its "besondere elektronisches Anwaltspostfach" (special electronic mailbox for lawyers, or beA). However, the reality has not matched the theory, and beA has been plagued with serious security problems. As a post on the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) site explains (<a href="https://fsfe.org/campaigns/publiccode/bea.html">original in German</a>)
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
Numerous scandals and a questionable understanding of security characterize the project, which has been in development for several years. Lawyers should have been reachable through this software since January 1, 2018, but numerous known vulnerabilities have prevented the planned start of the service.
</p>
<p>
...
</p>
<p>
Although a security audit was commissioned and carried out in 2015, its scope and results have not been published to date; the full extent of the faulty programming became known only at the end of 2017. Thus the project, which has cost lawyers so far about 38 million euros, has already lost people's trust. In view of the numerous errors, the confidentiality of the sent messages can no longer be guaranteed -- and this is for software whose use from 2022 onwards becomes mandatory for all court documentation traffic.
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Because of the continuing lack of transparency about the evident problems with the project, a number of German lawyers are supporting a <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/news/required-law">petition that asks for an alternative approach</a>, reported here by the Open Source Observatory:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
The petition calls on Germany's Bundesrechtsanwaltskammer (Federal Bar Association, or BRAK) to publish the beA software under a free and open source software licence and open the software development process. "Only in this way can it slowly restore the trust of the users -- all lawyers, authorities and courts," the petition says.
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
As the petition notes (<a href="https://fsfe.org/campaigns/publiccode/bea.html">original in German</a>):
</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>
Disclosure of the program code allows independent IT professionals to report potential security vulnerabilities early on so that they can be fixed; it has been shown once more that keeping the source code secret, and carrying out the audits as agreed in the contract [for creating the beA system] does not lead to the desired result. Free software also guarantees much-needed manufacturer independence.
</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Over and above the increased transparency that open-sourcing the beA code would bring, and the hope that this would allow security issues to be caught earlier, there is another good reason why the German system for lawyers should be released as free software. Since it will perform a key service for the public, it is only right for representatives of the German public to be able to confirm its trustworthiness. This is part of a larger campaign by the FSFE called "<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170914/09163238207/free-software-foundation-europe-leads-call-taxpayer-funded-software-to-be-licensed-free-re-use.shtml">Public Money, Public Code</a>", which Techdirt wrote about last year. Unfortunately, what ought to be a pretty uncontroversial idea still has a long way to go, as the painful beA saga demonstrates.
