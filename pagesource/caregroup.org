        a new parent company that will function as the sole corporate member of each hospital, and will also include

        estimated to be approximately $5,323,154,000.  There is not expected to be any anticipated price or service 
        impacts on the Applicant's existing Patient Panel. Any ten Taxpayers of Massachusetts may register in connection 
        with the intended Application or amendment by no later than October 16, 2017, by contacting the Department of 
        Public Health Determination of Need Program, 250 Washington Street, 6th Floor, Boston, MA 02108.
