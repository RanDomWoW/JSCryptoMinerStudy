<div class="ipsType_richText ipsType_medium ipsSpacer_both ipsSpacer_half" data-ipsTruncate data-ipsTruncate-type='remove' data-ipsTruncate-size='4 lines'>On the same weekend back in late 2016, two ladies shared stories of recent accidents at Toiletstool.com that are pretty delightful to people with our interests. The first was Carla, whose dog knocked the pee out of her in the final comic of last year. The other poster shared two stories in one, so I'm presenting both of them together as the next file in the series.</div>

Within 30 mins of taking it I’m usually passed out asleep for 10 hours (at least) and if I’m awake on them I’m slow, feel heavy, and it’s draining to lift milk out the fridge.. so I’m really lazy and weak lol.<br/>
<br/>
I take it before I sleep and usually wake around noon and super have to pee but never had an accident!.. until 2 weeks ago..</div>

I absolutely love Yomiclone's art style. He only has two comics, but they're already two of my favorites.<br/>

This download includes the original comic and a waifu2x upscaled version for 4k screens.<br/>

(Contains mild underaged wetting desperation. Also, no incest occurs in this story. All love expressed within is purely platonic.)
<br>
 
<br>
“Mama?”
<br>
She could only grasp the most obvious things when she first woke up. First, she existed. Second, someone was tapping her on the shoulder and calling out to her. Third, she would very much like to go back to sleep.
<br>
“Mmm-hmm-mmm,” was the only thing she could say at first.
<br>
“Mama!” said the young voice again.
<br>
“Mmm, what is it?” Corrin replied, finally opening her eyes.
<br>
A pair of bright red eyes and a cheery smile stared back at her from only a couple feet away. These belonged to her son Kana, who was clad in his normal light suit of armor instead of a pair of pajamas.
<br>
“You gotta get up now, it’s almost time!” Kana said.
<br>
“Um, time for what?” Corrin rubbed her eyes as she sat up. Her long-term memory had yet to wake up much like the rest of her body.
<br>
“You don’t remember? Time for our super-secret fishing trip!” said Kana, his face brimming with excitement. “You told me to come wake you up before the sun was up so we could get there before the fish went to sleep.”
<br>
“Fishing trip? Oh!” Corrin’s face lit up. “Of course, I remember now. I’m so glad you reminded me. I’ve been looking forward to our little trip together.”
<br>
Kana nodded. “Me too! Just me and mama catching fish together before anyone notices we’re gone. No adults to keep pulling you away for grown-up talks or other boring stuff.”
<br>
“Yes,” Corrin replied, making sure her smile didn’t drop from the pang of guilt she just felt. “Say Kana, how about you fetch us some apples and juice for breakfast while I get ready?”
<br>
“Okay! Don’t take too long, or all the good fish will be gone!” Kana said as he turned around and quickly took off, his bare feet pattering against the wood floor.
<br>
“Oh, and don’t forget your dragonstone!” said Corrin before he got too far away.
<br>
Now that she was alone, Corrin yawned and slowly climbed out of bed, shivering a bit when her feet hit the cold floor. I don’t know where all his energy comes from, but I wouldn’t mind having some of it for the mornings, she thought while she stretched. She ran her fingers through her hair to see how bad her case of bedhead was. Definitely needs combing .
<br>
As she sat to comb her hair, Corrin’s mind was free to drift, and she thought about the events that led her to this day.
<br>
The last few years had not been easy for her, to say the least. Not only had she learned that she was kidnapped from her original family and raised by another, but her adoptive father had tried to have her killed as part of a plan to start a war. She had been all over the continent since then, fighting endless battles and learning of terrible secrets that could destroy the world as she knew it.
<br>
But even in the chaos, she had found so much to be grateful for. Her families from both Hoshido and Nohr were such wonderful people, even if they didn’t always get along with each other. She was certain they would find a way to make peace between the kingdoms when the fighting was all over.
<br>
Then there was her husband, who she loved with all her heart. She had never expected to find love in the middle of her journey, but now she couldn’t imagine life without him. It was such a shame he was stuck on the night watch this day and would be too tired to join them on their trip. I’ll have to make sure he can come along next time, Corrin thought.
<br>
It was thanks to her husband that she found her greatest pride and joy: her son. Kana was the sweetest child she could have asked for, so full of life and kind to everyone. His innocent smile would always melt her heart; she could see him wooing quite a few girls when he hits that age.
<br>
Unfortunately, thinking about Kana always gave her a pang of guilt, too. Like the other parents, she had to leave him to be raised in a deeprealm when he was just an infant while she was occupied with the war. Time moved faster in these realms, and in just a few months, her baby had grown into an adventurous young boy. She made visits when she could, but there was nothing she wouldn’t give to have been there for all those years.
<br>
Corrin shook her head in an attempt to clear those troubling thoughts. This is why they were going on this trip. They needed some time away from the war and the feuding families and all their other responsibilities, if only for a couple hours. She only told her servants and her husband where they would be, so they would only be disturbed in case of emergency.
<br>
Corrin had just gotten out of her nightgown and into her armor when she heard a knock at the door. “Mama, I’ve got breakfast!” came Kana’s voice on the other side. “I also got my dragonstone with me!”
<br>
“Okay, Kana!” she replied, “I’ll be ready to go in just a minute!”
<br>
Corrin took a look at herself in the mirror. Aside from her sleepy expression and a stray hair or two, she didn’t look too bad for only having a few minutes to get ready. Not that I needed to look my absolute best, anyway . Satisfied with herself, she grabbed her sword, the Yato, from next to her bed and walked out the door, hoping to have a fun morning with her son.
<br>
<br>
 
<br>
“I got a bite!”
<br>
“That’s great!” said Corrin, “Get him over to the shore!”
<br>
“I’m trying!” said Kana as he wrestled with his fishing rod. “This fish is really strong! He’s gotta be a really big one!”
<br>
“Here, let me help you.” Corrin walked over to her son and stood behind him, grabbing onto his fishing pole. “We pull back on three, okay?”
<br>
“Okay!”
<br>
“One, two, three-whoa!”
<br>
The strength of two dragonkin was more than a match for the fish. It also proved to be greater than Corrin and Kana expected, as they lost balance and fell backwards onto the ground.
<br>
“Oof!” grunted Corrin. “Are you alright, Kana?”
<br>
Kana shook his head to help with the jolt he took. “I’m okay, but look!” He held the trout up for his mom to see. “He’s huge! This is the biggest fish I’ve ever caught!”
<br>
“I’ll say it is,” said Corrin. The fish was easily over two feet long. It would have made a fine meal if they were fishing for food, but they were not. “Okay Kana, let’s throw him back,” she continued as they stood back up.
<br>
“Aw, do I have to?” Kana frowned. “No one will believe me if I tell them I caught something this big.”
<br>
Corrin giggled to herself. Boys and their fishing stories. “I bet that fish wants to go home to his family. We really shouldn’t separate him from them.”
<br>
“Okay,” sighed Kana. He tossed the fish back into the river and watched it disappear from his sight. “Bye, fishie! Tell your friends I said hi!”
<br>
Corrin smiled at Kana’s cute display. It always brought her such joy to see him laughing and playing and enjoying his life. After all the fighting, drama, and tragedy they had been through so far, having time to relax and enjoy being together was doing both of them a world of good.
<br>
Yet as her sight kept getting drawn towards the water, Corrin couldn’t relax entirely. Normally, looking at a river brought peace to Corrin’s mind, for it always reminded her of Azura and the song she loves to sing. Her lyrics of the ocean’s waves always trying to reach the life that lied beyond the shores struck a chord with her that no other tune did, but today they only reminded her of a pressing matter that she couldn’t ignore any longer.
<br>
I forgot to use the bathroom this morning.
<br>
She felt the first few signals from her bladder when they were walking along the river that led to the fishing spot, but talking and fishing with Kana proved to be a good distraction. Unfortunately, the juice they had for breakfast had made its way down to the urine that had been building up overnight, and her urge came roaring back. She rubbed her legs together while Kana was still looking away to ease the pressure.
<br>
At that moment, Corrin realized that she had never actually mentioned to Kana that she needed the bathroom before. It was yet another difference she had from a parent that watched their kid grow up normally. A silly thought for sure, yet for some reason she felt some apprehension at the thought of telling him. I’m not shy like Sakura, she chided herself, surely I could just come out and say it.
<br>
“Do we have anymore bait?” Kana suddenly turned around and asked.
<br>
“Huh?” Corrin immediately set her legs straight. “Um, actually, we should probably get our things and head back,” said Corrin as she looked at the sky. The sun had risen a good deal since they reached their fishing spot. At least an hour or two had to have passed by now, she figured.
<br>
“Really?” Kana frowned again. “It feels like we just got here.”
<br>
“I know, time likes to fly when you’re having fun,” Corrin said while she walked over to him. “I wish we could stay longer too, but we both have a lot of work to do today and people depending on us to get that work done.”
<br>
Kana sighed and looked down in disappointment. “You’re right. I just wish we got to spend a little more time together.” He glanced at the river for a few seconds when his eyes opened wider suddenly, like he had just remembered something important.
<br>
“Um, actually I think I’m ready to go home too,” said Kana with a strange sense of urgency in his voice.
<br>
“Really? Why the sudden change of heart?” asked Corrin.
<br>
“It’s just, um, you know, I forgot that I have to, er, do something for someone?” Kana replied, only making eye contact with her for brief moments.
<br>
Oh dear, what has he gotten himself into now? thought Corrin.
<br>
Just as she was about to say something, Corrin received another unpleasant signal from between her legs. On second thought, I’ll worry about that after I find a bathroom.
<br>
“Okay then.” Corrin knelt down and picked up some fishing gear along with her sword. “Let’s get our stuff and head on back. They’re probably starting to wonder where we’ve run off to.”
<br>
“Already on it!” replied Kana, who only had a few things to pick up.
<br>
In less than a minute, Corrin and Kana were already on their way home. Corrin did her best to hide her growing need, but it wasn’t easy. They had followed the river a good ways to their spot, which meant they would have to follow it back to the gateway that led back home. The sight and sound of running water was always nearby and especially hard on the more sensitive hearing that Corrin enjoyed as a dragonkin, making her walking more stiff than usual.
<br>
The lack of distraction didn’t help, either. Kana had talked up a storm when they were walking to the spot, but he had hardly said a word on the way back. The only way Corrin knew he was still there was from his footsteps as he trailed behind her.
<br>
Why am I so reluctant to admit I need to go? Corrin thought. It wasn’t like she had never relieved herself outside; Camilla taught her that valuable skill when she was just a girl. There was plentiful cover as well, for the river bordered a forest. Kana had to have known that using the toilet was something everyone did. She had no real reason to be embarrassed, yet the stage fright would not let her just stop and tell him.
<br>
“Ooh!”
<br>
Kana’s yelp coupled with the sound of something falling on the ground snapped Corrin out of her thoughts. She turned around and asked “What happened?”
<br>
An odd sight revealed itself to her. Kana had dropped his fishing pole on the ground, but he wasn’t bending over to get it. Instead, he was fidgeting in the place with his legs locked together.
<br>
“Um, n-nothing’s wrong!” said Kana, “Just d-dropped my pole is all!”
<br>
Corrin sighed to herself. Okay, he’s definitely hiding something.
<br>
She walked over and looked down at her son with a stern face. “Kana, are you trying to sneak an animal home?” she said.
<br>
“No, of course not!” replied Kana, “Well, not this time, at least.”
<br>
“Okay, then what are you trying to hide? You know I don’t like it when you keep secrets from me,” said Corrin.
<br>
“I’m not h-hiding anything!” said Kana as he continued fidgeting. He stood in silence for a couple seconds afterwards before continuing, his voice noticeably quieter. “It’s just… I, um, really gotta go to the bathroom.”
<br>
Oh dear, thought Corrin, I was not expecting that. From what she could see, Kana was not lying; he had gone from holding his legs together to bouncing from one foot to the other and putting a hand over his groin.
<br>
“Well then,” Corrin started, “Did you not remember to use the bathroom this morning?”
<br>
“N-no, I forgot. I always go before I put my armor on, but I wore it to bed so we wouldn’t be late for fishing,” said Kana.
<br>
So he made the same mistake I did, thought Corrin. “Well, if you have to go that badly, you can go here.”
<br>
“Um, I can’t,” said Kana.
<br>
“Why not?” asked Corrin. “There’s nothing wrong with going outside, you know.”
<br>
“I-I know that,” said Kana, “It’s just… I’m trying to hold it in longer.”
<br>
To this, Corrin raised an eyebrow. “Hold it in longer? But why would you want to do that?”
<br>
Kana stopped bouncing for a moment. “Well, I kinda heard some of the older kids talking the other day. They were saying how they only use the bathroom a couple times a day because it helped teach them about staying focused and stuff, so I figured I could try it too. Holding it in while I was fishing seemed like a good place to start to me.”
<br>
“Really now?” asked Corrin. Who came up with that idea, I wonder?
<br>
“Y-yeah, it’s a lot harder than it sounds. You probably think it sounds dumb, don’t you?” Kana’s cheeks started growing red.
<br>
“Well, I wouldn’t say that. If it actually works, then who am I to judge?” said Corrin, “But like any training, you have to start small and work your way up with it. Just diving in hurts you more than it helps.”
<br>
“W-What do you mean?” asked Kana.
<br>
Corrin smiled. “I’m saying I think it’s okay if you had your morning pee before you start holding it for the day.” Something I would really like to have now.
<br>
“ Really? You’re sure about that?”
<br>
“Of course I am. Now hurry before you wet yourself.”
<br>
“Okay, if you think it’s fine…” said Kana, “Um, can you help me remove my armor first? It’s kinda hard to take off on my own, especially now.”
<br>
He’s not wrong there, thought Corrin. She recalled a couple close calls she had as a kid with her suit. “Of course, dear.”
<br>
Corrin kneeled down and moved her hands towards Kana. While he’s going, I’ll hide behind a tree and deal with my own problem, she thought, so I guess I won’t have to let him know I have to pee after all. Everyone wins, right?
<br>
“Now what do we have here?”
<br>
Corrin felt her whole body tense up. That voice was far too gruff to come from her son, and it certainly didn’t come from her. She stood back up and looked towards the direction the voice came from, confirming her fears.
<br>
Stepping out from between the trees were a group of four thugs, each brandishing a weapon and sporting a menacing grin on their ugly faces.
<br>
Gods, of all times, why now!? Corrin thought as she tightened her grip on both the Yato and her bladder.
<br>
“Looks like we stumbled onto a little mother-son bonding time,” said the bandit in front with an axe swung over his shoulder.
<br>
“Aw, ain’t that cute?” said a bigger man wielding a spiked club and wearing little more than shoulder straps and a waistcloth. “I wonder if she’ll send some of that love my way, heh heh.”
<br>
“M-mama, do you know these people?” said Kana.
<br>
“Get behind me, Kana,” was all that Corrin said. Out of the corner of her eye, she could see Kana doing just that. “Listen, I don’t know who you are, but we’re just passing through and we don’t want trouble.”
<br>
“What a coincidence, ma’am,” said an outlaw archer with a drawl, “We don’t want there to be more trouble than need be. I like my transactions nice and quick, if you catch my drift.”
<br>
The fourth bandit, a sorcerer with oddly white and frizzled hair chuckled. “Always lookin’ for money, ain’tcha? Take another look at ‘em. There ain’t even a pair’a shoes to their names.”
<br>
“No shoes, but that armor and sword might fetch a pretty penny,” said the axe-wielder, “And I think I’ll really like the looks of the mama without that armor in the way.” He slid his tongue over his lips.
<br>
As they chuckled among themselves, Corrin sized up her opponents. Their weapons look to be made of iron, so I doubt they can seriously wound me. I could probably deal with all of them without much trouble. But Kana… she glanced back at her son, who looked frightened and was firmly clutching his dragon stone. If something happened to him, I could never forgive myself.
<br>
She also felt another pang from her bladder, making her legs go stiff. Right, and that might slow me down too. What should I do?
<br>
“Come on lady, we ain’t got all day!” said the fire mage, “Let’s get a good look at your valuables, or would you rather have your day get more… explodey?” He snapped his fingers and a small fire formed in his hand while he grinned.
<br>
“Yeah, get your eyes off your brat and cough up your gear!” The axe-wielder brandished his weapon. “Or I may just have to give your kid there a nasty scar or two!”
<br>
In an instant, all thought vanished from Corrin’s mind. Her dragon blood pumped throughout her at a strong rate, and her frown of concern turned into a fearsome scowl. She lifted her sword and pointed it straight at the thugs.
<br>
“Leave, now. That is your only warning,” she said in a deadly calm voice.
<br>
To this, the grins on the bandits changed into frowns as they made quick glances at one another.
<br>
“Doesn’t like she’s backing down,” said the archer.
<br>
“She looks more mad than scared,” said the club-wielder. “Maybe we should rethink this?”
<br>
“Are you kidding me!?” yelled the axe-wielder. “Some tramp talks big, and you all get weak in the knees? Well I ain’t backin’ down from no one!” He pointed his axe straight at Corrin. “You wanna get bloody? Then have some of this!”
<br>
At that, the bandit launched himself forward, his axe held straight up in the air while he let out a battle cry.
<br>
He can’t say I didn’t warn him, Corrin thought. She stood almost motionless as the thug crossed the distance to her in no time at all. Before he reached her, the bandit leapt into the air and swung his axe downwards, hoping to bury it in her head.
<br>
Instead, Corrin jumped to the right, causing the axe to swing straight into the ground. While the thug stood there unable to process what just happened, Corrin put all her might into her off-hand and drove her fist into the thug’s face. A small amount of blood flew through the air as the bandit fell onto his back out cold, his axe still buried in the ground.
<br>
Seeing their comrade dispatched so easily made the other bandits flinch, but they quickly regained their composure. “You’ve done it now, wench!” yelled the club-wielder “Let’s get her, boys!”
<br>
This time, both the club-wielder and archer rushed in, the archer to the side while the clubber attacked head-on. For such a burly brute, he moved much quicker than Corrin anticipated. She had just enough time to lift her sword up as he swung down at her, stopping the club just short of her head.
<br>
Corrin grit her teeth as the half-naked thug chuckled while the spikes on his club drew closer to her face. He’s strong, maybe stronger than me. In the corner of her eye, she could see the archer taking up position at her side and reaching for an arrow. I need to do something, quick!
<br>
Just as the spikes were about to graze her head, Corrin remembered the club-wielder’s choice of fashion, or lack thereof. She drove her knee straight into the man’s groin, causing all strength in his arms to evaporate instantly. Just as the thug relented, her hearing picked up the noise of the archer drawing his bow.
<br>
Corrin immediately grabbed the bigger man by the shoulders. Using every ounce of strength in her body, she turned and tossed the man towards the archer right as he had let the arrow loose. The arrow buried into the club-wielder’s back as he tumbled into the archer, sending them both to the ground in mess of limbs and shock.
<br>
Upon seeing the two brutes incapacitated, Corrin allowed herself to let out a breath of relief. Okay, three down, one to- eep!
<br>
Using her strength like that had taken a toll on her muscles. Not only did she feel weaker, but she felt something warm and wet spurt into her undergarments, making her tense back up and squeeze her legs together. She stopped the flow as quickly as it had started, but it made her bladder give out a pang of pain in protest.
<br>
Dammit, that was too close! thought Corrin, I need to finish this fight as soon as I can, and not just because our lives are in danger.
<br>
“This one’s for you!”
<br>
Corrin realized that she was too focused on her bladder to see what the sorcerer had been up to. Once she turned to look at him, her expression changed into pure fright.
<br>
A massive fireball had formed from the mage’s hand, and before she could react, he launched it straight at her. The spell traveled fast, much too fast for her to dodge. All she could do was close her eyes, bring her sword up, and brace herself for the inevitable.
<br>
An explosion soon followed, and Corrin felt the heat of the fire and smoke blast across her skin. It was hot and uncomfortable… yet it didn’t hurt. A couple seconds passed, and still no searing pain like she had expected. Is this what death actually feels like? she wondered.
<br>
Once she felt the smoke clear, Corrin opened her eyes again and was taken aback by what she saw. A large, silver drake stood in front of her with its side turned to her. Smoke came from the wing draped across its side facing the mage.
<br>
“K-Kana?” said Corrin in surprise.
<br>
“NGH RGHH GRR GRHHHNN!” yelled the dragon as it turned to face the sorcerer and stomped on the ground. “That’s dragon for ‘Don’t hurt my mama!’”
<br>
“Wuh-what is that!?” yelled the mage, his eyes wide open in fear.
<br>
“That kid was a dragon!? It-it can’t be!” shouted the archer as he had finally slipped out from underneath the clubman.
<br>
“Just who are these two, anyway!?” said the club wielder.
<br>
“Forget this! I ain’t fightin’ no dragon! Every man for himself!” yelled the fire mage. He spun around and ran as fast as he could away from Corrin and Kana. The archer and the clubman soon followed after him, the club-wielder still having an arrow in his back.
<br>
Corrin’s scowl dropped away as she watched the would-be thieves run away. All it took was for one of us to enter our dragon form? Maybe I should try opening with that next time.
<br>
She then looked over to the axe-wielding thug still on the ground. He had regained consciousness, but his intimidating demeanor was long gone. Blood dribbled from his broken nose while he stared in utter fright, and a mysterious damp spot grew on his pants.
<br>
As Corrin walked over to him, he babbled in a higher-pitched voice than from before. “I-I wasn’t gonna hurt ya, honest! We just w-wanted some m-money to pay off some debts we owed! We’ve never done any m-mugging before this!”
<br>
Corrin pointed the Yato straight at his head, instantly shutting him up. “If you wish to not cross paths with us again, you will abandon your thieving ways and live an honest life from here on out. Understood?”
<br>
The thug nodded his head in response, his whole body trembling.
<br>
“Good,” said Corrin, “Now begone, and don’t threaten me or my son ever again.”
<br>
“Yes, ma’am!” The bandit scrambled away from Corrin’s sword and ran as fast as he could from her.
<br>
Once he was out of sight, Corrin sighed to herself. That wasn’t my best fighting now, but at least we’re okay. She patted her groin and grimaced a little. I still can’t believe I leaked during that fight. Oh well, that’s still better than getting seriously hurt.
<br>
“N-no, no no no…”
<br>
“Hmm?” Corrin looked over to where Kana was. He had turned back into his human form, but he didn’t look happy. He was hunched over with his face contorted like he was in pain.
<br>
The memory of that last attack came back to Corrin’s mind at once. The fireball! He took that blast straight on!
<br>
“Kana!” Corrin rushed over to him at once, dropping down to her knees and letting go of her blade. “Are you hurt!?”
<br>
“Mama…” Kana replied in a shaky voice, his eyes growing moist.
<br>
“What’s wrong!? Are you hurt at all!? Please tell me!” said Corrin as she frantically looked over him for any sign of harm. His armor looked more or less the same, but that didn’t mean he didn’t have any internal injuries.
<br>
“I-I…”
<br>
“Yes!?” Corrin looked him straight in the eyes.
<br>
And that’s when she heard it: a hissing noise of water hitting fabric not coming from the river, but from somewhere very close by. She looked down and noticed that Kana had his hands covering his groin, and his legs bent together.
<br>
Corrin’s look of panic turned into one of realization. “Oh, Kana. Are you-”
<br>
“I’m sooooooooooorrrrryyyyyyyyyy!”
<br>
At that moment, the proverbial dam broke everywhere. Kana shut his eyes and let the tears flow down his crimson-red face, while the hissing noise grew stronger even as he openly bawled. The dark fabric between the metal pieces of his armor gained a slight shine in the sunlight, and soon a small puddle formed under each foot.
<br>
Corrin’s mind failed her for that moment, so she stood there in shock. She felt her face grow warm as she watched Kana having his accident, but soon she remembered what she needed to ask him.
<br>
“Kana, did that fireball-”
<br>
“I tried to hold it! I really did!” cried Kana between sobs. “B-but then those bandits came, and-and they were gonna hurt you, so I used my stone, b-but I-waaaaaaahhhhh!”
<br>
“Kana, I don’t care about that right now!”
<br>
“I was g-gonna show you how g-grown up and b-brave I am now, but you p-probably think I’m just a… a big baaaaaaaaby-hee-hee-hee!” continued Kana.
<br>
“Please Kana, listen to me!” yelled Corrin.
<br>
But listen, Kana would not. He stood there continuing to bawl his eyes out while his legs grew ever wetter. By now, the two separate puddles had joined into one, such was the volume coming out against his wishes.
<br>
This isn’t good, thought Corrin, I really need to know if he’s hurt, but all he cares about is his accident. Corrin winced as she felt another pang hit her bladder, forcing her hands down to her groin. Ugh, and I have to pee so bad, I can barely think straight! If I don’t fix this now, I’ll end up wetting myself just like him…
<br>
Just like him!
<br>
Corrin gasped as an idea emerged from her desperate mind. She knew exactly how she was going to calm him down, but it was not going to be pleasant. She stood back up and sighed to herself. Mother, I really hope you’re not watching me right now.
<br>
“Oh-oh no! Kana!” Corrin said in a faux-distress tone. She then placed her hands between her legs and bounced back and forth on her feet.
<br>
“Aaah… huh?” Kana sniffed and opened his eyes. “M-mama? What’s wrong?”
<br>
“I really gotta go, too! I-I think… I’m gonna…” Corrin stopped bouncing and bent over slightly while pressing her legs together.
<br>
Now that she had her son’s attention, the only thing left to do was the one part she was not going to like. Corrin shut her eyes, took a breath, and relaxed her bladder muscles.
<br>
Immediately, the small warmth she felt on her crotch grew bigger as her undergarments quickly became saturated with pee. Corrin let out a genuine whimper, for this was the first time since she was a little girl that she was wetting her pants.
<br>
The warmth only spread from there. Unlike Kana, Corrin’s suit left the insides of her thighs bare, meaning the pee was much more visible than it was on her son. Some of it leaked through the fabric and dripped onto the ground, but most of it traveled all the way down her legs. Her feet grew wet as two separate puddles formed beneath her, and her ears picked up on a new hissing sound coming from a more personal source.
<br>
It was one of the most unpleasant and embarrassing sensations she had experienced in a long time. Her face had gained a bright red blush, one that only grew deeper as the sharp smell of ammonia reached her nose. Instinct was screaming at her to stop the flow and find a bush to squat behind while she still could, but Corrin resisted the urge and kept letting it out where she stood. Some things are more important than my dignity, she thought.
<br>
“Mama? Are… are you having an accident?” asked Kana.
<br>
Corrin opened her eyes and looked down. Kana was staring right at her lower body, with his mouth partially open and eyes unmoving.
<br>
She forced a smile and said, “Y-yes, Kana. I forgot to use the bathroom this morning too, and I just couldn’t hold it anymore.”
<br>
“Really? I didn’t know adults could still wet their pants.”
<br>
“You’re never too old to make a mistake,” said Corrin, “and you certainly don’t have to think less of anyone who does.”
<br>
“I don’t?” asked Kana, “So, does that mean you don’t think I’m a big baby?”
<br>
To this, Corrin giggled a little bit. “Far from it. I don’t think a big baby would be as brave as you were just now.”
<br>
Kana sniffed. “And you’re not mad that I peed in my suit?”
<br>
“You’re my son, Kana. I don’t think I could ever truly be mad at you.” Corrin looked down at her own legs, which had become soaked at this point. “Besides, I can’t get angry for something I’m guilty of doing too.”
<br>
“Heh heh, I guess not,” Kana said as he smiled for the first time since his accident begun. He had moved his hands away from his groin and taken a more relaxed stance, though Corrin could still faintly hear hissing from him.
<br>
Corrin sighed to herself from both her physical and emotional relief. Okay, he’s calmed down. I can finally talk to him. “Kana, did that fireball hurt you any?”
<br>
Kana shook his head and gave a big grin. “Nope, hardly felt it. I guess my dragon scales are a lot tougher than I thought!” He put his hands on his hips, a pose that would have looked heroic if not for the drops of urine still leaking out of his suit.
<br>
Corrin suppressed an urge to giggle at the sight. Maybe I don’t have to worry so much about him, after all.
<br>
Seeing her son back in a happy mood put Corrin’s mind further at ease. She took her hands away from her legs and let her bladder finish emptying into her saturated leggings. They clung to her skin with an uncomfortable warmth, but the initial sting of embarrassment had dulled away, allowing her to concentrate on the pleasure of having an empty bladder once more.
<br>
“I’m done now,” said Kana shortly after her stream had finally run dry.
<br>
He started peeing before me, yet we finished at the same time. Where in the world was he storing it all? Corrin wondered. “Do you feel better now?” she asked.
<br>
“Well I guess so, but I feel pretty gross, too.” Kana looked down and stepped away from his puddle, causing Corrin to do the same. “I didn’t think I’d ever say this, but I’d really like to take a bath.”
<br>
“Yeah, me too. Definitely something I don’t want to do again for a long time,” said Corrin.
<br>
“Um, do we have to walk all the way back home like this?” Kana asked with a worried look on his face.
<br>
We really should head back to the castle, thought Corrin, but if anyone saw or smelled us, I could never live it down, and I doubt Kana could, either.
<br>
“Hmm, tell you what,” Corrin pointed over towards the river. “I think we could do with a quick swim before we head back. What do you say?”
<br>
“Sounds good to me!” Kana beamed for a moment, but then his face drooped into a small frown. “Oh, um, I’m sorry, by the way.”
<br>
“Sorry? For what?” asked Corrin.
<br>
“I know you’re not mad, but I guess I kinda ruined the last part of our fishing trip.”
<br>
Corrin sighed and put her hands on his shoulders. “You have nothing to apologize for,” she replied, “If anything, this was all my fault. If I had just said I needed to go back at the spot, we might have missed those bandits altogether, and surely would have walked home with dry pants.”
<br>
“Hee hee, it’s okay. It was kinda cool to see my mama fight off all those bandits!” said Kana.
<br>
“Well, I did have help from a certain brave little dragon.”
<br>
“Yep! No one can stop us when we fight together!” Kana giggled.
<br>
That’s my son, alright. Corrin couldn’t help herself. She bent down and said “Come here,” before pulling him into a hug. In no time at all, Kana wrapped his arms around her and hugged her right back.
<br>
“You’re the best mama ever,” said Kana.
<br>
“And you’re the greatest son I could ever ask for.”

One more night, that's all Foxy had left to survive. One last night, and Jeremy will have passed his initiation, everyone could go back to their normal schedules. Foxy, well aware of the curse that had befallen her, had once again done any and all preparations to make it through the night. She couldn't let her body get the better of her this time. She would hold it through the night, she had to.<br>
 <br>
For now, she was doing okay. Yeah, there was a tingle in her bladder now, but it was already a couple hours into the shift, and she had things to keep her mind occupied. Right now, she was right outside the night guard door, because she was going to shine. Good thing she had powerful ears, so she didn't need to see Jeremy to know what he was doing. Just one second of an opening, and everything would be golden.<br>
 <br>
She may not have to wait long. She could tell when he was looking at the camera monitor by the electronic hum of the screen, but that wasn't enough of an opening when he had peripheral vision. Now, she could hear he was distracted by something, and she could only imagine what it was when he said, “what the fuck are they doing now?” Someone was doing something, Foxy would probably never know what, but it was a clearing, and she would take it happily.<br>
 <br>
No time to waste, Foxy jumped out from beyond the doorframe, emitting some kind of screeching sound to intimidate him, throwing herself into the room. She had momentum, she was in the air, Jeremy was in her sights and was going to get tackled. Time slowed down in her eyes, she saw him notice her motion, but there was no way he could react in time. His finger twitched on the screen, probably a nervous response, Foxy rationalized.<br>
 <br>
That's what she thought, until a mechanical whirring began above her. Something came crashing down over her head, and she only realized what it was when the light from inside the office was cut off. Her long muzzle crashed into the hard door while it was still moving down, forcing her down with it. Foxy bounced when she hit the tile floor, her face still sliding on the metal door. She was stunned and numb, but then the pain set in. Her paws pushed her away from the door with all her strength, more than she knew she had because it sent her tumbling back one flip, landing her hard on her butt. That wasn't the hurt that got to her, as her paws gripped her muzzle, not in a way that would block her mouth from opening because she needed to cry in agony. “OWWW! OwwowwowwowwOWWW!” She rubbed her nose, which felt really unpleasant, and checked it. No blood, at least, but she was finding it hard to believe there was no lasting injury. “If that broke my nose, Jeremy, I'm biting your brain out!”<br>
 <br>
Though muffled through the thick metal, he did reply. “You're fine, stop whining. You just hurt, you'll get over it.”<br>
 <br>
Foxy did not take kindly to her torment being made light of. “Fuck you too, Jeremy!” She got on her feet and ran off, back to Pirate's Cove. She was still holding her nose, which did a good job at hiding her crying.<br>
 <br>
She was so distracted by her grief that she wasn't paying enough attention to her running path, because she ran into something. Being that her muzzle stuck out farther from her body, and her head was further forward anyway, so her nose was at the forefront of the impact. A new surge of pain whacked her like a steel door (she knew what that was like personally), and she went back onto the floor while covering her nose. “Owowoww! Watch where you're going, asshole!”<br>
 <br>
“I'm so sorry, Foxy! You came running while I was coming through and I didn't have time to move and...are you crying?” It was Mangle, and he was now kneeling next to Foxy on the floor, checking up on her.<br>
 <br>
She was crying, there was no hiding that, but she wasn't about to admit that it was more because of emotional distress. “Y-yeah, Jeremy closed the office door on my face and I ran into it.”<br>
 <br>
“Believe me, the entire building heard that crash. You're not bleeding, at least. Is it alright if I take a closer look?” Foxy nodded, and Mangle leant closer to her face. There was a brief moment where he locked eye contact with her, before his focus darted downwards to her nose. He gently touched the muzzle area, at which point Foxy immediately winced, bared her fangs, and recoiled. Mangle didn't try to pull her back, he had a diagnosis already. “Yeah, it's hurt all right, but there doesn't appear to be any lasting damage. Just don't crash face first into anything for a while.”<br>
 <br>
Foxy wasn't planning on it, and would have said it, but something she had kind of noticed on Mangle in their brief eye contact put itself together in her mind. More easily visible due to his white fur, Foxy could see a black mark around Mangle's left eye. “Looks like I'm not the only one to suffer facial damage today. What happened to your eye?”<br>
 <br>
“Oh, that? One of the kids punched me. Like you said, it's a hateable face. It doesn't hurt, it's just a mark, you don't need to worry about it.”<br>
 <br>
“But won't a black eye like that scare the little kids, or their parents? Hang on, let me fix this.” Foxy reached behind her head and grabbed the band to her eyepatch, pulling it above her head and removing the headwear. She flipped it to fit on the head of one facing her, and snapped it over Mangle's head. She adjusted it to fit snugly over his left eye, and it was enough to cover the mark. Foxy giggled at the sight of him with just one piece of a pirate uniform. “There, perfect.”<br>
 <br>
“Sure, no one would be worried by the kid's caretaker wearing an eyepatch. Thanks, I appreciate it.” Foxy could have sworn Mangle looked away bashfully for just a second, and while it could be attributed to low lighting, there could have been a blush too. “I look like a moron, don't I?”<br>
 <br>
“Total dummy.” Foxy laughed at his new look, and Mangle joined in at his own misfortune. “We should probably hide now, Pirate's Cove is close by.” She led the way back to her domain as her one-fox convoy followed.<br>
 <br>
As Mangle trailed behind, out of Foxy's sight, he raised his paw to say something, his mouth opened to begin talking, but he didn't want to make what was on his mind known. He wanted to breach a topic, it was gnawing at him, but he didn't know how to do it. It needed to be said, he just couldn't do it now, so he just followed quietly.<br>
 <br>
Foxy reached Pirate's Cove's curtains and held them open for her friend, who silently followed her lead and entered the room so she could close the curtains. Darkness engulfed both of them for a few seconds, before Foxy turned the miniature light she kept stored in the room on, providing some means of illumination. Foxy was feeling her abdomen worsening, but it was passive for now.<br>
 <br>
There was a bit more silence following, until Mangle broke it, and he was being blunt. “So...what are you playing at here, Foxy?”<br>
 <br>
“Playing? The hell are you talking about?”<br>
 <br>
“You didn't have to invite me in here. You let me stay here for a long while last night. I saw the way you were nervous around me yesterday, I've seen the way you look at me any time we're close. I'd say you've got something specific you're keeping from me.” Mangle leaned in with his paws on his hips, smiling with his eyes half-shut in that smug “I know I'm right” way.<br>
 <br>
He was right, Foxy knew that, but she needed to play it off cool. It wouldn't work if she just straight admitted she liked him, that's way too forward. Also, he was wrong about her being nervous yesterday instead of a different problem, she could redirect him by claiming misinterpretation “Why do I need a reason to be nice to you? You're my friend, you know that.” She thought that, but a horrifying realization occurred to her. “You do know I'm your friend, right? You never doubted that? I know I've said a few things to you that are pretty mean, but I always liked you, I was only playing around.” Foxy was pretty worried she had driven off someone without realizing.<br>
 <br>
“What? No, I knew you were playing. You really don't realize the signs you give off to me at basically any time? It seems pretty obvious to me, you've got a really big crush.”<br>
 <br>
Now her secret was out in the open, and Foxy didn't know how she could keep going feeling exposed like that. She could still deny it. “What are you talking about,” she answered to throw suspicion off, but a nervous laugh interjected in the middle of the sentence betrayed her. Mangle wasn't stupid, that would not get past him unnoticed. “Did Chica tell you?”<br>
 <br>
“She did, said she was 'being sick of waiting for you to get off your ass and just say it”. Give me some credit, I was seeing the signals before I was told anything. She just...put the last pieces together.”<br>
 <br>
“That's a rude thing for her to say. I was waiting until I thought the moment was right, that didn't mean it would be this week. That's a hard thing to confess.” But it was in the open now, she might as well do something about it. “So...now that you know about it, what do you think? You know, about us...together?”<br>
 <br>
“Honestly, it's less of a 'I feel the exact same way' and more 'I got nothing else, let's try it'. You're my friend, so I know you're a good girl, and you're, um...” He had a reason to make the point now, but he didn't know how she would react to the thought considering how he had mentioned it. “You're also really hot.”<br>
 <br>
She didn't get angry or defensive like he was expecting, but she still responded, agitated. “That needs to be the first rule of our relationship. I don't care what you've seen already, you're not getting a fast track to my boobs again. If anything, you got it when you weren't supposed to, you're not seeing it for longer as punishment.” Foxy covered her chest and turned away a little to get her breasts out of focus, and lifted one leg to cross against the other as a symbol of modesty.<br>
 <br>
However, as one leg came across the other, her bladder suddenly awakened, like it couldn't comprehend why she could cross her legs unless she had to pee, and her body's needs needed to be consistent. Or did she just really need to legitimately piss all of a sudden? Foxy would never know, all she needed to be concerned with was, damn, she needed to take a leak something fierce. But how, how could she need to relieve herself at such a bad time three nights in a row, when she had taken steps to avoid it happening. There shouldn't have been enough liquid in her body by this time to fill her bladder at all.<br>
 <br>
She didn't need to understand it, she just had to focus on the present. And in that present, Foxy needed a piddle, painfully bad, and Mangle was with her. She needed her privacy, but she couldn't push Mangle out, not after she had just wooed him...kind of. She was being bashful about her body, but she really did want Mangle to take it and ravish it. Just not yet, and especially not when it threatened to let loose a mighty flood from her genitals.<br>
 <br>
Right now, Foxy desperately needed something to take her mind off her urine, and Mangle would be great for that. “Mangle, there's something I've been wanting to ask you for a long time. Why do you go by that name at all? When did you get the nickname and why did you let it stick?”<br>
 <br>
“I don't remember much before I came here. I just remember being beaten up and broken before this, and that's where Mangle came from. I kept it, because...I don't have anything else, that's the only name I've ever been called. Doesn't matter where or who, I'm always being abused. Again, like you said, hateable face.” The way he said it sounded like he wanted to be lighthearted, but it was plainly obvious he was hurting from the memories.<br>
 <br>
That was the worst thing Foxy could imagine; a friend, one known for being humorous even when the situation was not appropriate, feeling down on himself because of something she said. “I know I said that, but...I certainly don't believe it myself.” She leaned in close to Mangle, brought her paw up to his face, and stroked his cheek with her claw, soft enough to not leave a mark. “I think you're really cute, actually.” Her eyes closed as she leaned in, her mouth opening for a kiss. Mangle saw what she was doing and responded in kind, their mouths slowly connecting.<br>
 <br>
It was right as they touched, Foxy realized why that was a terrible idea. She recoiled in a fraction of a second, covering her face for the tenth time that night because she was very forgetful about her physical condition. “Ow ow, nose, nose!” Distracted by pain, she walked backwards without any consideration for what was behind her. As such, the backs of her legs hit a crate that had been placed there in storage where it wouldn't be seen, sending her tumbling backwards, her spine crashing hard onto the wooden box before she bounced behind it, her legs propped up on the carton as the rest laid on the cold tile floor. She didn't cry out in pain again, her mouth just hung open in shock as the breath was knocked out of her.<br>
 <br>
Mangle was going to laugh at her, but he was nice enough to ask about her situation first. “You okay there? You're just a real klutz tonight, you're gonna end up seriously injured if you keep this up.”<br>
 <br>
True, Foxy didn't suffer any fractures or internal bleeding as a result of the fall, but something bad was still on its way. A crash like that, happening to someone with a filling bladder, not a good combination. Before Foxy had even regained her bearings, both of them heard a hissing sound, paired with the soft pattering of it hitting fabric. She couldn't move from horror, he could see everything that was happening, it was unmistakable to anyone who would see it; Foxy wet her pants.<br>
 <br>
Foxy was mortified. She didn't have to go all that bad, she could have held it if she didn't take a dive. And now, a cute guy was watching her pee herself because she tried to kiss him without considering the consequences. She wasn't going to cry, she wasn't going to lower herself even further by crying, but she hated herself right then. She had done something so childish and she would never forget it, nor would anyone let her. She just wanted to stay in her spot, where her butt continued to soak in her own waters, and drown in her shame.<br>
 <br>
As she wallowed in self-pity, Mangle stood by to observe. He was watching his friend, his new girlfriend, have an accident on the floor. Why was he still watching it? He wasn't taking enjoyment from her humiliation, he wouldn't do that to a friend even if that was exactly the kind of guy he was. He wasn't watching to see her leak, he didn't care one way or another about that. He was just...watching, the same way he'd watch any normal event. But it wasn't normal, so why was he acting like it was just another thing? Maybe he was used to his own bathroom visits and didn't find this fascinating, even if Foxy was most certainly not using a toilet at the moment.<br>
 <br>
Whatever the reason, he watched until Foxy finally emptied, when the sound of falling liquid hitting the forming puddle stopped. That was the point when Mangle suddenly realized, Foxy hadn't noticed him. She had been busy being upset to pay attention to what was happening outside her body, or outside what her body had created. But she noticed him now when she looked up at where he was standing, intense sorrow in her eyes. Mangle expected her to cry, that's a pretty natural reaction to what she had just accidentally done, but he also expected her to get angry at him, not just from projected aggression against herself, but because he had stared like a pervert, the second time in as many days. Instead, she just looked at him sadly with puppy dog eyes, asking “what do you think of me now, a baby fox that wets her pants,” with choked back tears.<br>
 <br>
Mangle wasn't going to blame her, he never thought of that, even as he pieced together what had happened on Foxy's side, over the last three days. Accidents happen, that was something any staff member at a children's business needed to accept, especially those dealing with very young kids like him. He was smarter than most gave him credit for, something he had no problem repeating, but something about the way Foxy looked, how depressed she was, it wasn't the right time to show how perceptive he was by figuring it all out. Maybe, just now, he needed to play dumb. “Damn, that must have been a really bad fall to make you piss yourself like that. You okay, no serious damage?”<br>
 <br>
Foxy was stunned, she had just had a really major accident in front of the boyfriend she just got a few minutes before, and he was acting like it was no big deal. Almost as if he was more concerned about her well-being over some pee, what a novel concept. “Uh, y-yeah, I-I'm okay. I mean, outside of soaked shorts, that is. Thanks for asking.” Her sentences were stilted, she couldn't believe this is what she was saying.<br>
 <br>
Mangle leaned over the box that caused everything and reached a paw out to Foxy. She grabbed it, and he pulled her upright, a few drops falling off her pants into the large puddle she was now standing in. “That's good to hear,” he said as he looked deep into her golden eyes. “Still, you've had one hell of a night, and we're only a couple hours in. Might be a good idea to turn in early.”<br>
 <br>
He said it like it was nothing, but Foxy could sense the subtext, that hidden meaning behind his words clear to her. And while she would have liked to just sleep everything off, she couldn't turn down that secret offer. “You're probably right. I really need to get out of these shorts, they're starting to get cold. I need to warm up.” She wanted to be as sly as Mangle, but she couldn't help cracking a smile with a giggle.<br>
 <br>
Now that Foxy had understood what he was getting at, he didn't need to be so subtle. “I'll escort you upstairs. I can also stay with you, make you feel more comfortable, make you feel whatever you want to feel...” Just then, he was interrupted by a sound emitted by the radio in his pocket, though he couldn't discern what it was exactly.<br>
 <br>
Annoyed that the moment was abruptly ruined, Mangle pulled out the walkie talkie and pressed the talk button. “Whoever just talked, what did you say? Didn't catch it. Not rogered.”<br>
 <br>
“I said, what are you and Foxy doing,” Freddy demanded. “Neither one of you has checked in at all!”<br>
 <br>
Mangle was not putting up with this, and he turned the device's back to face him, used his claw to pop the rear cover, and pulled the battery out. Putting both pieces back into his pants, he looked at Foxy, who was amazed at what he had just done. He just shrugged and replied, “battery's dead.”<br>
 <br>
“I just realized I left my radio upstairs. Freddy's gonna be pissed about that. Like he probably will be about that mess. We should probably clean that up.”<br>
 <br>
“Fuck it,” Mangle responded. “I'm tired, I got better things to do, I'm not dealing with this now.” Foxy was impressed by his sudden boldness, because she kissed him right there. He grabbed her as they made out heavily, expecting her to push back. She didn't, and when they broke, the first thing he asked was “how's your nose now?”<br>
 <br>
“Mangle, my shorts are drenched in my own pee. Nose pain really doesn't matter right now. If we're going to do something, we should go now, I'm not going to be in the mood if we stay in Pirate's Cove.”<br>
 <br>
He was happy and ready to oblige, and led the way as the two walked through the pizzeria halls to the stairs, Mangle standing directly in front of Foxy to shield her from the security cameras. On their journey, Mangle had to ask something, quietly so they wouldn't be heard. “So, what happened to your modesty ground rule of our relationship?”<br>
 <br>
“I'm not a robot, I'm a girl. A girl with needs, ones that need to be fulfilled right now. Shut up so we can do it.” Mangle was satisfied with that answer, and he turned back to face their movement direction, giving Foxy silence to think. Sure, she had completely humiliated herself, but all in all, this night was going to be amazing.<br>

Zora’s Domain was the most beautiful place in all of Hyrule. At least, that’s what Princess Mipha believed. She might have been a tad biased in that regard, having been born and raised within its mountains her whole life, but she couldn’t imagine anywhere else possessing the same level of beauty to her. The way the sunlight glistened off the scale-like constructions, with crystal-clear water rushing, cascading, and trickling all around its walls, there was no place she felt more at home.
<br>
At the moment, however, all that water was not a particularly appealing sight or sound to her.
<br>
“Mmm, I must start scheduling more breaks in my duties,” Mipha muttered to herself while she briskly made her way across one of the domain’s many walkways, a slight stiffness in her stride. The morning had been a busy one for her, what with her training as the domain’s appointed champion as well as the general preparations for defeating Calamity Ganon. Now that she was by herself for the first time since leaving her quarters that morning, she had become aware of a discomfort growing between her legs. How she had not noticed it before, she could not say, but it certainly had her full attention now.
<br>
Mipha was not about to deal with this burden in her bladder any longer than she needed to. She picked up her pace a little more, her goal being her bedroom and the water closet within. It was not very ladylike to think so, but she had no doubt it would feel quite nice to sit on her more personal throne and rid herself of all that unclean water and waste. She was quite looking forward to it, if she had to be honest with herself.
<br>
“Lady Mipha?”
<br>
Which made it difficult to hide her disappointment when someone called out to her.
<br>
“Oh! Um, y-yes?” Mipha stood up straight and turned around, wearing a smile no one could tell was not entirely genuine. She made eye contact with the servant standing before her and asked, “Am I needed for something?”
<br>
The servant bowed. “It seems we have an unexpected visitor to the domain today.”
<br>
“A visitor?” Mipha raised an eyebrow. It was odd that she would be getting told about such a thing in this manner. “Have you informed the king or any of the other advisors?”
<br>
“Yes, and they asked me to inform you as well,” replied the servant, “Our visitor is the Hylian Link.”
<br>
“L-Link!?” Mipha could not hide the surprise and excitement on her face even if she wanted to. “Y-You mean, the appointed champion of Hyrule himself?”
<br>
“Yes, my lady. It seems he is here as part of his training, particularly in lance combat and swimming.”
<br>
“I… I see,” Mipha said, trying to put some restraint back into her posture and voice. “Has he been waiting long?”
<br>
“Not very, my lady. I informed the king, but he is currently busy with his advisors, so I came to you. Link still waits at the plaza by the main fountain.”
<br>
“Then I shall go to him at once.” Mipha bowed. “Thank you. You may return to your normal duties.”
<br>
“At once, your grace.” The servant returned the bow and turned around to leave.
<br>
As soon as he had gotten far enough away, Mipha let her smile come back in full force. One of her favorite Hylians was here today out of the blue? If not for her fatigue from training, she’d have sworn she was dreaming. If by some chance she actually was, she had better get moving and meet him before he woke up, she figured.
<br>
And so, Mipha set off towards the plaza with a noticeable stride in her walk. If she had moved any quicker, she likely would have been skipping to the fountain. Not that she would ever do that with so many onlookers; the thought alone made her blush.
<br>
In no time, she had reached the plaza. There he was, standing in front of the fountain, looking with appreciation at the domain’s majestic buildings. Already Mipha felt a flutter in her heart as if she was a teenager fawning over a crush. It was not too far from the truth, she supposed.
<br>
“It is always a pleasure to see you, Link,” Mipha announced. He turned to her, his blue eyes making contact with hers. She may have years of training in formalities, but those eyes and smile of his always made her feel like a blushing schoolgirl.
<br>
She knew Link was not one for words, so Mipha cleared her throat and continued. “Though I am sad to say we have not prepared a proper welcome for you. You have caught us at a particularly busy time. That said, I am certain we can provide a meal and some lodging for you if you give us the time-”
<br>
“Watch out!”
<br>
This shout from a random zora put Link and Mipha on alert, looking every which way for the cause for alarm. They soon got their answer, for an arrow with a golden tip struck the ground nearby, causing a surge of electricity to erupt from the spot. The other zoras immediately ran for whatever cover they could find as a second, third, and fourth shock arrow landed, creating crackling lightning all around.
<br>
No words needed to be exchanged. Link and Mipha put their backs together, Link drawing his weapon they lifted their heads up to look for more arrows before they or anyone else would receive a deadly shock. No more came down, however; instead, a distant but powerful roar bellowed from the eastern mountains, then everything was quiet once more.
<br>
“Not again,” mumbled Mipha as she returned to a relaxed stance. She turned around and saw Link putting away his sword and looking at her with a raised eyebrow.
<br>
“I’m sorry you had be here for that,” she spoke, “This was certainly not the kind of welcome we had in mind for you.” Seeing no change in Link’s demeanor, she continued. “We have come under attack by a lynel recently. It seems it has happened upon a quiver of shock arrows, and it’s been using them to try and force us into providing it food and other necessities.”
<br>
Mipha paused to look at one of the arrows in question. The lightning had long dissipated, but she knew far better than to even go near them. “A single touch of a shock arrow can be enough to seriously hurt a zora, or even kill. We have not given into the lynel’s demands, but its attacks grow worse by the day. I fear it won’t be long before someone…”
<br>
Not wanting to think of that outcome, she looked back at Link. He did not need to say anything, for Mipha could see it in his eyes: that quiet determination he would always get before a fight. That said more than any words could.
<br>
“Link? Are you certain about this?” she asked. “We could never bring ourselves to place this burden on a visitor, and...”
<br>
Mipha trailed off again as Link had already responded by walking past her and towards the stairs that would lead to Ploymus Mountain, not a single bit of hesitation in his stride. Her advisors would likely have considered that rude, but Mipha could not help but admire his dedication. No one else but the Champion of Hyrule would immediately set off to help others all on his own.
<br>
No, not alone, Mipha realized. She could not let him take on the lynel alone, not when she could help him out. While her weapon of the choice, the lightscale trident, was unfortunately being repaired after becoming chipped in her training, her healing powers could still save his life if he were seriously hurt in the fight. Besides, he would likely need directions on how to get to the lynel’s home in the first place.
<br>
Mipha took her first step towards Link, but gasped as soon as she put her foot down. The motion had caused an unpleasant signal to be sent from her bladder to her brain, reminding her of the bathroom visit she had neglected. “Oh dear,” she muttered. It had been hours since she had last relieved herself, and the pressure had grown to be quite uncomfortable. Knowing now that she would probably not get another chance to pee for a while only made that feeling worse.
<br>
She shook her head and stood upright. She was the appointed champion of the zoras; she had far more important things to worry about than being able to use the washroom. Picking up her pace, she set off after Link, focusing her thoughts on the lynel and how they could defeat it and save her kingdom.
<br>
 
<br>
 
<br>
At least, that’s what she tried to do.
<br>
The zoras had never carved a proper path all the way up to Ploymus Mountain, as they had never needed to. No one really had reason to go there, and the zoras could simply swim up there via the waterfalls leading to the top. That was something Mipha would have to address when she returned to the domain.
<br>
It was not the effort that worried Mipha. Swimming up the waterfalls was akin to a light jog for her, and while Link had to scale the cliffs by hand, his stamina seemed limitless with the way he effortlessly climbed up. In truth, she fretted over the time it took to scale these cliffs, with every passing minute making her bladder feel a little heavier and bloated. All the rushing and falling water was certainly no help, either. She may be a zora, but even she wasn’t immune to their suggestive powers.
<br>
Shaking her head again, Mipha tried to refocus her attention once more. Before her now was Lulu Lake, home to the last of the waterfalls leading to Ploymus Mountain. One last swim, and all the water would be behind them, letting her focus on the lynel at last. She looked up to the sheer cliffs and saw Link nearing the top, having almost scaled the whole thing in but a couple minutes. Is there truly any feat he cannot accomplish? thought Mipha.
<br>
She had better make her way up to meet him at the top, she figured. Stepping into the cool waters, another pang of discomfort rang from her groin, causing her to wince. The idea had occurred to her of relieving herself while Link was busy climbing, possibly even let go once she was waist-deep in the waters. However, she simply could not bring herself to do it with Link near her. Perhaps it was vanity, pride, or just a shy bladder, but to do that around the object of her affection was just… unthinkable. She would grin and bear it while by his side, then use the facilities back home like a proper lady. Anything else was unacceptable.
<br>
With that in mind, Mipha waded into the waters and up to the waterfall, letting her scales grow used to the waters again. Taking a breath, she dove under the surface, then shot up the falls like a rocket, bobbing and bending with the waters with an elegance befitting a princess of the zoras. In just a few seconds, she had already launched past the top of the falls, spinning in the air to right herself before landing squarely on her feet, her body perfectly upright.
<br>
“Ah!”
<br>
Not for long, however.
<br>
She felt it the instant she hit the ground: a dribble of liquid much warmer than from the waterfall escape from between her legs, going straight down with no barriers to absorb it. In an instant, Mipha clenched the muscles in her groin tighter than before, preventing anything else from leaking out of her.
<br>
The damage to her mental fortitude, however, had already been done. Suddenly, the possibility of reaching a bathroom all the way back in the domain was looking highly unlikely now. As reluctant as she was to the idea, she would have to find a reason to get away from Link and answer nature’s call in its domain.
<br>
But a glance to her side showed her that Link was looking right at her, and the panic in her mind came back. He… didn’t see it come out, did he? No, he couldn’t have, not with the rest of the water… right?
<br>
“Eh heh, s-sorry if I worried you there. The landing was a bit rougher than I expected,” said Mipha, returning to a more refined posture. “The lynel’s den is just up ahead. I’ll show you there.”
<br>
At once, Mipha walked forward before Link could respond, as unlikely as it seemed. She kept her walk as inconspicuous as she could, but Mipha knew there was a bit of stiffness now. Her only hope was that Link was paying more attention to the surroundings than to her, in case the lynel was nearby.
<br>
A short time later, and they had reached the summit of Ploymus Mountain. A plateau with several rock structures jutting out from the ground greeted them, but the lynel was nowhere to be seen.
<br>
“This is where the lynel has been nesting,” said Mipha, “But it would seem he is not home right now.” She was not entirely certain how to feel about this development. Their lives were not in immediate danger, but that also meant they would likely have to wait for him to come back. Her leak had shown that her time until she could no longer hold was slowly but surely running out.
<br>
She took a step forward, intending to see if the lynel was not hiding somewhere, when she felt a hand on her shoulder. “Hmm? Yes?” she asked, turning back to Link.
<br>
Mipha then saw the rare sight of Link’s lips moving. It took a moment for her to process that she had the honor of hearing him speak. He had such a lovely voice, she wondered why he would rarely use it. Unfortunately, what he had to say did not make her happy in the least.
<br>
“T-Turn back?” Mipha responded in shock. “You… can’t mean that, surely?”
<br>
She had hoped Link was joking, but knew better. Link was not the jovial type, and the stern look in his eyes was all she needed to know that he wasn’t becoming one now.
<br>
“I can’t just leave you here,” said Mipha, “I know I’m unarmed, but what if you got seriously hurt, and I wasn’t here to heal you? You could… mmm!”
<br>
No, not now! thought Mipha as another wave of pain hit her, this time forcing her to close one eye and bring her legs together. She certainly didn’t need to give Link any more cause for concern, but these shockwaves were not doing her any favors. Already, Link was lifting his arms and stepping towards her out of concern.
<br>
As much as she wanted to be in his arms again, she had to stand tall and strong for both their sakes. “I… I’m fine, truly,” she responded, taking a step back. “You don’t need to worry about me. I can stay out of sight while you fight the lynel, but I must stay with you-wwwhahh!”
<br>
Before she knew what was happening, Link dove forward, plowing into Mipha and sending the two of them into the ground. The hard impact coupled with the shock of being tackled out of nowhere proved too much for her muscles to absorb. Another spurt of yellowed liquid escaped from her, a bit more than the previous one, before her muscles could clamp back down to hold back the flood.
<br>
Just as Mipha was about to ask what compelled Link to do such a thing, a loud and familiar crackle of electricity lit up the ground nearby. Another shock arrow? But that means…
<br>
A monstrous roar was all she needed to confirm her fears. Both Mipha and Link turned towards its source and found what they came looking for. The lynel clutched its bow in its hands while sporting a furious sneer across its face. That arrow was clearly not meant to be a warning shot.
<br>
The two champions wasted no time scrambling to their feet as the lynel reached for its quiver. Link unsheathed his weapon, the legendary Master Sword, along with the Hylian Shield and raised them to show that he was ready to defend the two of them. As much as Mipha wanted to fight by his side, she knew that without a weapon of her own and with her bladder fit to burst, she would be of no help to him.
<br>
Thus, her only choice was to retreat and find somewhere to take cover while Link battled the beast. Looking around, she spotted a rock pile near the path that lead back down the mountain. It was large enough keep her covered so long as the battle did not spill over to her side. She turned to the pile and took off, one hand between her legs while she shot Link a glance. Their eyes met for a moment, exchanging what they needed to know far faster than words could communicate, and they nodded in understanding as they enacted their plan.
<br>
Reaching the pile, Mipha turned around and hunkered down, subconsciously pressing both hands to her groin while she watched the battle begin. She had expected Link to be proficient with a sword, but what she saw could only be described as poetry. Every swing of his blade, every parry with his shield, every flip and jump to avoid the lynel’s attacks, all were executed with such expertise that Mipha could not help but stare in awe. I really am hopeless around him, aren’t I?
<br>
“Oh!” Yet another wave of pain, this one making Mipha double over with her legs pushed together as much as she could. No, I mustn’t falter here! she yelled in her head as every last bit of strength she had went into keeping her personal dam from cracking any further, let alone bursting wide open.
<br>
In her desperation, a thought occurred to Mipha. Link was occupied with battling a monster on the other side of this rock, and the chances he would look over and see her were slim. Could she not simply squat and release all that burdensome waste while they continued fighting? A fierce debate erupted in her mind as she weighed the decision: Let go and risk being seen in such a vulnerable state, or endure it just a little longer like the champion and princess she was?
<br>
Before she could make that decision, the roar and stomps of the lynel got her attention again. Looking back up, she saw it charge around to her side of the rock. Standing back up with her hands still glued to her groin, she was prepared to run again and get away from it, until she noticed Link riding atop its back. The lynel bucked and kicked as hard as it could, but Link would not be dislodged from his spot, all while he dealt numerous slashes to its back and withers. As the lynel gave one last buck, Link launched himself up and over the monster’s head, landing right in front of it. A glow appeared on the Master Sword as Link twisted his body, then unleashed a spinning swing that struck the beast hard across its midsection.
<br>
All went quiet for a moment as the lynel stood motionless, its mouth agape in visible pain. A quiver then ran along its horse-like legs and they buckled immediately after, the beast’s upper body slumping over with its eyes falling shut.
<br>
Mipha could have almost cried at that moment. Success was theirs, and with that, the opportunity to squat and let out a waterfall just as loud and mighty as any other in the domain. Before that, however, she needed to check Link for injuries, if he had any.
<br>
While Link put his sword and shield away, Mipha mustered every last bit of strength she had to stand up tall and walk towards him. Each step sent another wave of pain through her, making her stride undoubtedly stiff and strained, but at least Link was not looking at her for much of it.
<br>
As she got closer and Link turned to smile at her, Mipha found she did not have the strength to look him in the eyes, so she focused on the lynel instead. Having never seen up so close before, she had to admit they were quite fearsome. That Link stared this beast down and battled it without any hesitation spoke volumes of his courage.
<br>
But then she saw the beast’s finger twitch ever so slightly. Her reaction was instant and certain.
<br>
“Watch out!” was all Mipha had time to yell as she dove forward, wrapping Link around her arms and launching the two of them away. Milliseconds passed like minutes in the time they were off the ground, the lynel’s razor-sharp blade coming to within a hair’s length of Mipha before whooshing past, leaving only the feeling of a slight wind across her back. For a moment, soaring through the air, Link in her arms, Mipha felt weightless, like a piece of wood adrift in a limitless ocean. There was a strange bliss to it, despite avoiding a deadly blow not even a second ago.
<br>
Gravity quickly brought that moment to an end. Mipha and Link soon hit the ground with a hard thud, their momentum and the incline of the path sending them tumbling down the mountain. Nothing seemed to make sense to Mipha as she jerked and slammed against hard ground and a warm body, the world spinning around her while she held onto Link for dear life.
<br>
This, too, was over as quickly as it started. They now lied only a short ways down the path, their heads swaying in dizziness. It was only after Mipha shook her head to regain her focus did she realize she was lying on top of Link. She had never so much as shaken his hand before this; it was enough to turn her cheeks as red as her scales.
<br>
But there were more important things to worry about first. “L-Link? Are you alright?” asked Mipha, looking right at him.
<br>
Link blinked a few times and focused his gaze onto Mipha, lifting his head and smiling a bit in response.
<br>
“Oh, I’m glad to hear that,” she replied. “I’m sorry about the tumble there. I didn’t mean for us to fall that far, just enough to…” Mipha suddenly lifted her head and looked back to the lynel, remembering it was still there. The monster let its sword fall outs of its grasp before collapsing completely, its eyes rolling up into its head.
<br>
It took a couple seconds for the feeling of victory to sink into Mipha. They had skirted danger and defeated the monster that threatened her home, with hardly a scratch on either of them. That was more than enough reason to be content with their performance.
<br>
Looking back to Link, she could see he was smiling along with her. Their eyes met, and the surrounding world faded away in Mipha’s mind. Lying here on top of Link, sharing their body heat in the sun, both tired from their long walk and battle, Mipha was in a state of pure happiness.
<br>
But then her eyes and mouth opened wide in horror as she felt a different kind of heat. A wet heat, pooling around her loins and spreading to her thighs, along with the feeling of something being rapidly pushed out of her body in that region. In all the chaos, she had somehow forgotten about how close to bursting she was. Against her wishes, her bladder had decided enough was enough, and chose this exact moment to release its contents.
<br>
“Ah… aaah!” Mipha groaned, her body frozen in place while she unintentionally answered nature’s call right there and then, the slight noise of water spreading across clothing and onto the ground having reached her ears. Where there was clarity in her mind just a moment ago, now there was a mess of conflicting emotions. The lovely feeling of relief clashed with the embarrassment of losing control, and Link was there to witness it all, his mouth opening and cheeks turning rosy as he figured out what was happening…
<br>
No, not just witness, she finally realized. With her on top, there was another person being covered with her pee. The very last person she wanted this to happen to, no less.
<br>
“G-gah!” Mipha scrambled off to the side of Link, her limbs flailing about while urine continued to escape at a steady pace. Unable to stand upright in her state, she frantically crawled away, leaving a wet trail along the ground and panting all the while.
<br>
It was not until she was clear of Link that Mipha stopped her crawling. Not that it made her feel any better; the damage had been done, and was still being done to herself, for that matter. With how soaked her legs felt already, there was little point in maneuvering into a proper squat, let alone trying to stop herself from peeing any further.
<br>
All that was left was to accept her failure, and all the humiliation that came with it. Lifting herself onto her knees with her feet to the sides of her bottom, Mipha sighed, closed her eyes, and hung her head as she let her bladder finish emptying. Even after all she had let out prior, it still took a while for her pee to come to an end. It was more than enough for a golden puddle to grow a good deal outwards from her rump, fully covering the front of her legs and feet.
<br>
But soon enough, the puddle stopped growing, and Mipha could no longer feel anything coming out. It was done, and in the worst possible manner. Kneeling in her own waste, Mipha could not imagine any princess of the domain before her in such a disgraceful state. She had to try and save some face if she still wanted to call herself a champion.
<br>
Mipha opened her eyes with the intention of standing up, only to lose that drive upon seeing Link standing before her. What drew her gaze was not his face, but the wet patches on his tunic and trousers. Seeing her crime for herself that close up was too much for her to bear.
<br>
“Link,” she started, not daring to give him any eye contact, “I’m… so sorry.” She wanted to say more, anything else to maybe diminish this humiliation, but did such words even exist? If they did, she would never think of them in such a distraught state. Then again, this shame was entirely deserved, she supposed. She had been careless, stubborn, and unreasonable, everything that a champion should not be, and her friend paid a gross price for it. He would probably never look at her the same way again, and she would just have to live with it.
<br>
Or so she thought. Through her tear-obscured vision, Mipha could just make out a hand held in front of her, its palm facing up with the intention of her to grab it. Her gaze trailed up his arm and onto his face, where she found a smile lacking any judgment or disdain. Of course he would be compassionate even now; it was just who he was, she reminded herself. It was enough to make the corners of her lips pull upwards as well.
<br>
Placing her hand in his, she allowed him to pull her onto her feet. Now face-to-face, she could not hide the redness in her cheeks, but somehow, standing in her own urine, she found the courage to talk again.
<br>
“I… er, that is, the zoras all cannot begin to thank you enough for helping us slay this beast,” she began. “I am not sure how we can repay the huge debt we owe you now.” Looking down in modesty, she noticed the wet patches on his clothes once more. “Well, I think I know how we could start.” She returned her gaze to his. “What say you and I clean ourselves up back at the pond first? It is the least I can do after…” she trailed off.
<br>
Link only nodded in response.
<br>
Mipha allowed a light giggle to leave her throat. Does this mean I will get to see Link without a shirt on? Oh my... “Then we ought to get going before they’ll have to make you a new tunic,” she concluded, turning back towards the pond. They set off, leaving Ploymus Mountain, along with the defeated lynel and her puddle, to the elements once more.
<br>
 
<br>
 
<br>
Standing atop the divine beast Vah Ruta, Ploymus Mountain seemed so quiet now from Mipha’s view. She imagined the only sounds that could be heard there were the wind sweeping across the ground and the occasional wild animal moving about. Looking in its direction always brought back memories of that day, prevailing over the lynel, tumbling down the hill, the pleasant warmth of being so close to Link and the shameful heat of wetting herself on top of him.
<br>
Of course, she could not feel that warmth now, nor would she ever feel it again. The sensation of touch had been lost to her for so long, she had almost forgotten what it felt like to move through the waters and have the cool, gentle breeze lick off the last few drops of a swim. She would never smell anything again either, be that the clean air of a lake or her own urine.
<br>
Mipha looked down at her hands, now with a green aura and transparent enough to see through. Death was a strange experience, to say the least. She had thought she’d be filled with sadness and regret, and it was there to an extent, but there was a quiet peace to it all as well, keeping her patient and hopeful for the final clash against Calamity Ganon.
<br>
Perhaps it was her memories of Link that gave her the will to persevere long after her body was gone. All she needed to do was think of the short time she got to spend with him, and her resolve to see her destiny to the end would return. She would always cherish her memories with Link, even and especially her one moment of disgrace.
