This entertaining and still topical play brings an act of political sin into the heart of the English home. As an ambitious government minister, Sir Robert Chiltern\'s smooth ascent to the top seems assured until Mrs Cheveley appears in London with damning proof of his previous financial chicanery. This is the third play from the Oscar Wilde Season, a year-long celebration of the brilliant Victorian playwright being staged by the Classic Spring Theatre Company.","Teaser":"As an ambitious government minister, Sir Robert Chiltern\'s smooth ascent to the top seems assured until Mrs Cheveley appears in London with damning proof of his previous financial chicanery.","Cast":"TBC","Director":"Event Director","FriendlyName":"an-ideal-husband","Experiences":[{"Id":"497","Name":"2D","ExternalId":"2D","Order":1},{"Id":"501","Name":"Event Cinema","ExternalId":"Events","Order":7},{"Id":"499","Name":"XLR Available","ExternalId":"XLR","Order":12},{"Id":"520","Name":"Live Via Satellite","ExternalId":"LVS","Order":25},{"Id":"528","Name":"Recliner","ExternalId":"Recliner","Order":27},{"Id":"445","Name":"Gallery Available","ExternalId":"Gallery","Order":63}],"Genres":[{"Id":150768,"GenreName":"Event"}],"Cinemas":{"NowShowing":[{"CinemaId":7779,"CinemaName":"Nottingham Cinema de Lux","CinemaUrl":"","CinemaFilmUrl":"","ExternalId":null,"SecondExternalId":null},{"CinemaId":7778,"CinemaName":"Bristol Cinema de Lux","CinemaUrl":"","CinemaFilmUrl":"","ExternalId":null,"SecondExternalId":null},{"CinemaId":7780,"CinemaName":"Southampton","CinemaUrl":"","CinemaFilmUrl":"","ExternalId":null,"SecondExternalId":null},{"CinemaId":7769,"CinemaName":"Leicester Cinema de Lux","CinemaUrl":"","CinemaFilmUrl":"","ExternalId":null,"SecondExternalId":null},{"CinemaId":7775,"CinemaName":"Reading","CinemaUrl":"","CinemaFilmUrl":"","ExternalId":null,"SecondExternalId":null},{"CinemaId":7774,"CinemaName":"Peterborough","CinemaUrl":"","CinemaFilmUrl":"","ExternalId":null,"SecondExternalId":null},{"CinemaId":7777,"CinemaName":"Walsall","CinemaUrl":"","CinemaFilmUrl":"","ExternalId":null,"SecondExternalId":null},{"CinemaId":7776,"CinemaName":"Teesside","CinemaUrl":"","CinemaFilmUrl":"","ExternalId":null,"SecondExternalId":null},{"CinemaId":7763,"CinemaName":"Coventry Cinema de Lux","CinemaUrl":"","CinemaFilmUrl":"","ExternalId":null,"SecondExternalId":null},{"CinemaId":7764,"CinemaName":"Derby Cinema de Lux","CinemaUrl":"","CinemaFilmUrl":"","ExternalId":null,"SecondExternalId":null},{"CinemaId":7760,"CinemaName":"Bluewater","CinemaUrl":"","CinemaFilmUrl":"","ExternalId":null,"SecondExternalId":null},{"CinemaId":7762,"CinemaName":"Cardiff Nantgarw","CinemaUrl":"","CinemaFilmUrl":"","ExternalId":null,"SecondExternalId":null},{"CinemaId":7766,"CinemaName":"Dudley","CinemaUrl":"","CinemaFilmUrl":"","ExternalId":null,"SecondExternalId":null},{"CinemaId":7768,"CinemaName":"Leeds Cinema de Lux","CinemaUrl":"","CinemaFilmUrl":"","ExternalId":null,"SecondExternalId":null},{"CinemaId":7767,"CinemaName":"Glasgow","CinemaUrl":"","CinemaFilmUrl":"","ExternalId":null,"SecondExternalId":null}]},"MediaItems":{"Still2":"","Still1":"","Quad":"//images.mymovies.net/images/film/cin/500x377/fid18320.jpg","OneSheet":"//images.mymovies.net/images/film/cin/350x522/fid18320.jpg"},"Order":20},{"FilmId":49354,"Title":"Avengers: Infinity War","Cert":"TBC","Img":"//images.mymovies.net/images/film/cin/350x522/fid18206.jpg","Trailer":"//ml5vid.mymovies.net/filmmedia/film/fid18206/trailers/trid16290/html5/700.mp4,//ml5vid.mymovies.net/filmmedia/film/fid18206/trailers/trid16290/html5/700.ogv,//ml5vid.mymovies.net/filmmedia/film/fid18206/trailers/trid16290/html5/700.webm|16290|Avengers: Infinity War - Trailer|18206|http://images.mymovies.net/images/film/player_imgs/fid18206_trid16290.jpg|","ReleaseDate":"2018-04-26T00:00:00","RunTime":"155","Synopsis":"<p>Avengers: Infinity War brings to the screen the ultimate, deadliest showdown of all time.
