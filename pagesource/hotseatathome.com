				<p>We have spent the past decade traveling to every corner of the globe, recording the most insane infield footage to ever exist, and helping thousands of guys get insane results with women that they could only DREAM of before.</p>
				<p>We have gone from city to city, and country to country teaching the Hot Seat, and it has become our most raved-about program to date.</p>
				<p>Up until now - The The Hot Seat has worked like this:</p>
				<ul class="list">
					<li>We take the most informative, eye-opening full-length clips of pickups, and we break them down, step-by-step.</li>
					<li>Then we would take this amazing, beautifully-shot video with crystal-clear audio, we would break it apart… analyze it… and pull out the core principles and techniques.</li>
					<li>Then we follow it up with these crazy, crazy exercises that reinforce the core concepts you learn in the videos.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 class="inner-title">We have spent YEARS to build the PERFECT PROGRAM...</h3>
				<p>We have fine-tuned The Hot Seat to be the most high-impact, life-changing program that exists anywhere in the world - there is nothing else like it - period.</p>
				<p>The Hot Seat is an event that has been taken by 10’s of THOUSANDS of people.</p>
				<p>But the thing that’s frustrated us over the years, is that we’ve never really succeeded in creating that same experience from home… UNTIL NOW.</p>
				<p>The thing was - because The Hot Seat is a live event… not everyone is able to attend, we get messages from guys all over the world:</p>
				<p>“I can’t make it… I live a million miles away!”</p>
				<p>“Why can’t you come to my city / country more often?”</p>
				<p>and</p>
				<p>“I WISH I could make it… it would be so awesome… what do I do?”</p>
				<h3 class="inner-title">We get hundreds and hundreds of emails - BEGGING us to bring this training to them…</h3>
				<p>The more messages we get… the more we realize that there are THOUSANDS of guys who NEED this, RIGHT NOW, but can’t get it.</p>
				<p>Over time…</p>
				<p><em>IT… DROVE… US… INSANE!</em></p>

            	<h3 class="program-title">If You’re a Beginner:</h3>
                <p>The Hot Seat at Home is designed so that you don’t just have a chance to LEARN the techniques, but you actually a chance to IMPLEMENT them. This will give you a glimpse into what your reality SHOULD look like, and you will tell yourself:</p>
				<p>"Holy Shit! This is really possible! I can do this!"</p>
				<p>You will visualize the results, develop a solid foundation, and lay the groundwork for all future skills to come.</p>
				<h3 class="program-title">If You’re Intermediate:</h3>
                <p>You probably already realize that a lot of what you have been doing is already working. You are probably already getting results, but those results are not as consistent as you would like them to be.</p> 
				<p>As you start to go through The Hot Seat at Home...</p> 
				<p>You will begin to see the frameworks, systems, and patterns all come together. As you work through it and develop consistency, you will start to see better and better results. </p>
				<p>Instead of getting results once a month, or once a week, you will know how to get those same results 5-6 days EVERY WEEK (...if you want to). You will understand that you can be at your very best EVERY time, instead of just sometimes... all it takes is a few small adjustments.</p> 
                <h3 class="program-title">If You’re Advanced:</h3>
                <p>You will pick up on energies that would otherwise be inconceivable to decypher, you will learn the intricacies and advanced techniques that most people miss.</p> 
				<p>You will find new angles to explore, discover new perspectives, and establish new frameworks that will allow you to take your game to a whole nother level.</p>
				<p>You will be able to revisit the content at different paradigm levels - as you get better and better you will constantly find new discoveries and tools that you can implement.</p>
				<p>Regardless of where you are on your journey, you will be able to come back to the content again and again, revisit it with a fresh perspective, and pull out new nuggets of epicness every single time.</p>

				<p>You have to promise that as soon as you get The Hot Seat at Home, you will make a commitment to no longer be a spectator in life.</p> 
				<p>As you go through The Hot Seat at Home…</p>
				<p>You will have moments when you have to step out of your comfort zone, and you will want to give up - in that moment, you will gather strength, and you will PUSH THROUGH.</p>
				<p>You will have days when you don’t feel like going out - in that moment, you will remember the reason you started this journey, and you will GET UP!</p>
				<p>You will have nights when nothing is going your way - in that moment, you will call upon the training in The Hot Seat at Home, and you will ACT in the face of fear.</p>
				<p>Before you go any further...</p>
				<p>You have to make a promise to yourself, right now.</p> 
				<p>Without that promise, nothing we do will be able to help you.</p>
				<p>Tell yourself:</p>

				<p>Well, what we came up with you’re going to really like:</p>
				<p>We’ve created is a supportive, fun environment for you to be able to test the skills that you learn, implement them, and  then get feedback from your peer group so that you can improve even further.</p>
				<p>Rather than doing the live version where we have you doing the exercises within the group, we want to get you doing this at home… with MISSIONS.</p>
				<p>These Missions are designed so that you see the Hot Seat, and you have the weekly missions that will let you test the skillsets in your own city.</p>
				<p>And what we’ve done is created a Facebook Group where you can post your feedback and reports of what you’re doing so you can actually get feedback from other people.</p>
				<p>From there we’ve created a Phone App where you can communicate with everyone else who is doing The Hot Seat at Home.</p>
				<p>From there to make it very supportive, and to make sure that you take action - we have created regular phone conferences where you can talk with Tyler, and other instructors, ask questions, and be supported throughout this entire experience.</p>
				<p>So, between the Missions, the Facebook Group, The Phone App, and the Teleconferences - What you have is a class where you are going to be forced to take action, have a supportive environment, and be able to watch the Hot Seat again and again.</p>
				<p>Now you can watch the Hot Seat, right from the comfort of your own home and benefit because you can watch it again and again whenever you want, and pick up these lessons, and actually transform.</p>
				<p>You’ve got it on-demand, and you can watch it anywhere, anytime and get these amazing concepts.</p>
				<p>This is an amazing at-home experience that is SYNERGISTIC with the live experience - both are really good, and they feed into each other.</p>
				<p>Whichever one you choose to do, you will be able to achieve phenomenal results.</p>
