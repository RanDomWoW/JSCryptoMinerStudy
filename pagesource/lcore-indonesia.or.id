	<h1>Welcome to LCORE website</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">LCORE stands for Promotion of Least Cost Renewables in Indonesia. The LCORE project is funded by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) and implemented by the GIZ Renewable Energy Program Indonesia in cooperation with the Indonesian Directorate General of New and Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation (DG-NREEC).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">LCORE promotes the use of renewables in areas where renewables can be applied cost efficiently. In this context, LCORE operates in three fields of activities: (1) utilization of biomass waste from the agricultural industry for power generation, (2) replacement of diesel fuel through grid-connection of renewables as well as (3) new application and models for off grid renewables.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project is part of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.international-climate-initiative.com" target="_blank">International Climate Initiative (ICI)</a>. BMU supports this initiative on the basis of a decision adopted by the German Bundestag.</p></div>

	<strong>Enabling Project Finance in Indonesia</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	Blessed with the geographical position and location condition, Indonesia is a country&nbsp; with an abundance of potential renewable energy (RE) sources. The country particularly benefits from major geothermal, hydropower, solar and biomass potential and yet this continues to be largely underexploited. Indeed, the private sector faces various market and non-technical barriers to investment.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
	<img alt="" src="/images/BF 1.jpg" style="height: 239px; width: 568px;" /></p>
<p align="center">
	<sub><em>The sustainable finance stakeholders in Indonesia discussing on risk and mitigation issue.&nbsp;Photo credit: Pacto Convex Ltd.&nbsp;</em></sub></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<span style="text-align: justify;">One of these barriers is the accessibility of financing which is crucial for project developers due to the high initial investment in building RE plants. Most Indonesian banks still perceive RE projects as high risks due to lack of capacity, experience and empirical evidence of succesful RE projects. As such, financing for RE projects by commercial banks have come through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) fund or conventional lending practices with corporate guarantee or with traditional collateral. The “non-recourse or off-balance sheet” project finance where the banks accept the project assets and expected future cashflow as repayment guarantee for the loan do not exist in Indonesia unlike in more industrialised countries.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	The Indonesian government has laid out policies and frameworks such as feed-in tariff (FiT), subsidies, tax exemptions to attract renewable energy investors and project developers. However, it is aware that these tools cannot single-handedly bring about the desired momentum in terms of financing RE projects and that it is necessary to encourage banks to be more active on this market. In light of this situation, the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB) which currently funds two programmes which are active in Indonesia - Promotion of Least Cost Renewables in Indonesia (LCORE-INDO) jointly implemented by GIZ and the Indonesian Directorate General for New, Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation (DG-NREEC) and the Green Banking programme implemented by RENAC -&nbsp; would like to see an activity that would contribute to moving things forward on this front.The LCORE-INDO, moreover, is also part of the international climate initiative (IKI) which is supported by BMUB on the basis of a decision adopted by the German Bundestag.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	The collaboration resulted in the provision of a seminar, workshop and panel discussion during the World Renewable Energy Congress 2016 in Jakarta. The event on 19 September 2016 entitled “Financing Renewable Energy Projects: Know the Risks, Seize the Opportunities”&nbsp; was designed to catalyse a change of mindset among the Indonesian financial institutions that RE is an investment-worthy sector and to subsequently bridge the lack of technical expertise in banks by providing an introductory training on risk identification and mitigation of RE projects.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	The event which was formally opened by Edi Setijawan, the Director of Sustainable Finance of the Indonesian Financial Services Authority (OJK), was attended by representatives from national, provincial and international banks as well as non-bank financial institutions and selected insurance companies. The morning seminar session which targeted Director-level audience, highlighted the recent global development in RE costs and investments and attempted to show how the Indonesian government’s RE target translated into business opportunities for the financial sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	The seminar session was followed up by a risk assesment workshop for the participating banks’ credit risk analysts and energy sector specialists. With five case studies of Indonesia’s specific RE projects developed by LCORE-INDO team, and traning material on the topic provided by the Green Banking programme, the joint exercise providedan introduction to the participants on how to identify and mitigate techno-commercial risks woven into the case studies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	The day was closed with a short panel discussion on how to enable project finance for RE projects in Indonesia. Apart from OJK, the high-level panelists included representatives from &nbsp;DG-NREEC, former Vice President of one of Indonesia’s biggest state lenders,&nbsp; Director of a utility company,&nbsp; representative of&nbsp; the Indonesian Renewable Energy Society (METI) and EuroCham, who also assumed dual role as project developers in their private sector capacity. The panelists discussed issues and challenges for Indonesian banks applying project finance concept for RE projects and what further supports and capacity building measures needed to move things forward.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	The event was deemed as a success due to the high turn out. With more than 100 participants, there was obviously huge interests on the topic and a demand for such training. Although renewable energy is not yet identified as business opportunities for most Indonesian banks, the event highlighted the need for pointing out such opportunities, for promoting succesful projects and for providing trainings.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong>Indonesia Visiting ASEAN Neighbours for Increasing RE Deployment</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	The Government of Indonesia (GoI) has started to promote the deployment of Renewable Energy (RE) of which the sources, Indonesia has in great abundance.&nbsp; GoI has set a target of 23% RE in the energy mix by 2025, with specific target of 8 GW for Photovoltaics (PV) and 5.4 GW for bioenergy. Furthermore, GoI has also committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 29% in 2030 from a business as usual baseline or with an additional of 12% reduction with International support. To meet such ambitious target, a conducive regulatory and fiscal environment needs to be present in the country to facilitate private sector investment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	GoI represented by Directorate General of New, Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation (EBTKE) under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) has launched a range of feed-in-tariffs targeted to increase private sector participation in RE generation. The government has established procurement mechanism for certain RE technologies through auctions and feed-in tariffs. However, the expected private sector investment was not immediately forthcoming due to numerous factors. Since then, the scheme has been put on hold while the government is looking to formulate a new policy to kick-start the market.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	Meanwhile on the regional level, ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation (APAEC) 2016 – 2025 where the AMS set an aspirational target to &nbsp;increase the component of RE to 23% by 2025 in the ASEAN Energy mix. Therefore to supportGoI in achieving the RE target, Energy Programme Indonesia/ASEAN implemented by EBTKE and GIZ on behalf of the German Government, facilitated a 5-day visit to Thailand and Malaysia. The visit aims to provide knowledge and experience exchange on RE policies and framework conditions in the two countries which have been successful in attracting private sector investment in the RE sector. This is in line with one of ASEAN strategy to develop a RE-hub information sharing mechanism among the AMS on RE data, policy instruments, policy update, and best practices for promoting RE.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	The Indonesian delegation which consisted of Ms Maritje Hutapea and Mr. Sudjoko Harsono, respectively the Director of Various Energy and the Director of Bioenergy from the Directorate General for New, Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (DG-NREEC), Mr. Darwin Siregar (Head of Renewable Energy at PLN), and other RE experts from Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of National Development Planning (Bappenas), started the visits on 22 August in Bangkok, Thailand. The delegation first visited the Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency (DEDE) where they were welcomed by the Deputy Director General, Mr. Danai Egkamol. The meeting discussed about the Thailand feed-in tariff scheme including the tariff and quota setting. Unlike in Indonesia, the delegation discovered that the FiT scheme in Thailand is financed by the public through a surcharge on their electricity bills, According to Ms. Rungrawee Yinguad, the Head of Waste to Energy Group, “the quota was set to find the right balance between meeting the government’s RE target and the amount of money the public is willing to pay”. The Indonesian delegation in return shared information about the Indonesian support scheme for renewable energy. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<span style="text-align: justify;">As one of the crucial issues for realising renewable energy projects is the availability of financing, the delegation then met with representatives from Kasikorn Bank in their headquarter. The bank pioneered the first project finance for solar project in Thailand whose success led other commercial banks to follow its lead. Mr. Obboon Vongsuriya, the Multi Corporate Business Head was personally involved in the bank’s first foray into financing renewable energy project and he explained the challenges and steps taken before the bank decided to give the project a green light for financing. As the bank became more and more familiar with financing solar projects, the loan tenor offered by the bank has also been extended from the initial seven years to presently&nbsp; up to 18 years. The First Senior Vice President of Kasikorn Bank, Mr. Suradech Kietthanakorn who initially welcomed the delegation explained that the bank recently opened its first representative office in Jakarta and will be looking to support the development of renewable energy in Indonesia.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	In addition to meeting policy makers and financiers, the delegation was arranged to meet two project developers in Thailand. The first one was Thai Biogas Energy Company (TBEC) who pioneered the first biogas plant in Thailand. Its CEO Mr. Pajon Sriboonruang explained about the challenges with the regulatory regime in Thailand and how he led the industry players to form an association which was central to shaping the present policy framework. The second project developer was SPCG who developed the first solar plant in Thailand. The lively and charismatic CEO Dr. Wandee Juljarern shared her long struggle in getting financing for her first project and the many smart steps she took to ensure that the plant would be a success. The delegation was particularly impressed when they were shown a tour of the EUR 5mio state-of-the-art control room of SPCG which monitors the performance of all of their 36 solar PV plants. Dr. Alisa Khunchornyakong, the Deputy Managing Director of SPCG who is also the niece of Dr. Wandee, explained to the delegation about the different screen displays, colour markings and the overall working of the control room. The tour gave a clear picture to the delegation how solar PV plants can be professionally operated and maintained remotely. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<span style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, facilitated by members of Malaysian Photovoltaic Industry Association (MPIA), the visit was continued to Putrajaya, Malaysia where all Indonesian delegates had a morning meeting with Malaysian governmental agencies that are responsible on RE issues, among others are: Sustainable Energy Development Agency (SEDA), representatives from Ministry of Power, Environment, and Water (KeTTHA), and Suruhanjaya Tenaga (ST). In this dialogue, the Indonesian delegation discussed deeper about general renewable energy policy, its implementation and its challenges in Malaysia, especially on Feed-in-Tariff (FiT) and Net Energy Metering (NEM). According to SEDA Malaysia FiT aspires to achieve target of 2080 MW until 2020. The presentation from SEDA deliberated on the mechanism of FiT scheme and explained the RE Fund contribution through electricity bills (1.6 % of total electricity bill provided consumption is beyond 300 kWh) The NEM scheme is being introduced between 2017 until 2020 through competitive bidding . Ms, Catherine Ridu (CEO of SEDA) said “Such visit, learning from each other, will strengthen ties between ASEAN Member States, not only to achieve the national target but also the regional ones”.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<span style="text-align: justify;">To get better picture on the RE policy implementation and getting to know more about Malaysia’s RE development, the Indonesian delegation then met representative of private sector, PEKAT Teknologi Sdn Bhd, a solution provide specialising in Photovoltaic (PV) technology. The presented explained in detail about the Investment Tax Allowance Scheme. Here the delegation also discussed about project financing with Malaysian Debt Venture (MDV), a finance agency that aims to support the Nation’s technology agenda and increase Malaysian technology companies’ probability of success through: innovative and flexible financing solutions, specialised funding programs, industry expertise and advisory services, and nurturing young companies. From the knowledge sharing, the delegation got a clear picture on the current RE challenges from development to financing phase.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p align="center">
	<sub><em>The Indonesian Delegation posing at PEKAT Teknologi Sdn Bhd. Photo credit: GIZ Indonesia/Intan Cinditiara</em></sub></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<span style="text-align: justify;">The night is young, the delegation continued the journey to a welcoming dinner organised by Malaysian Photovoltaic Industry Association (MPIA) while also gathering with some other Malaysian RE stakeholders, e.g. Green Tech Malaysia - that catalyses green technology deployment as a strategic engine for socio-economic growth in Malaysia in line with the National Green Technology Policy 2009, Gading Kencana Sdn Bhd – as one of the biggest renewable energy service provider in Malaysia. Last but not least, before heading back to our origin, Indonesia, the delegation had a fruitful discussion with Malaysian utility, Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB). TNB is the largest electricity utility in Malaysia and one of the largest in the region, with an asset base totalling RM110.7 billion. With a history spanning 65 years, TNB is also the most experienced energy player in the country, responsible in keeping the lights on for all residents of Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Labuan. Here the delegation shared more about FiT and NEM implementation and exchanged anticipated challenges in Malaysia.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<span style="text-align: justify;">The trip to Thailand and Malaysia has been an informative and eye opening experience for the Indonesian delegation. Although the renewable energy and electricity market in the two countries are different to Indonesia, there are some ideas concerning policies, incentives, market set-up etc. which could be adopted or adapted to suit Indonesia’s needs to accelerate its RE development. EBTKE has particularly appreciated the opportunity to network with policy makers and players in RE in the region and believe the contacts made through this delegation visit will be useful for future cooperation.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
	Jakarta, Indonesia - A “Focus Group Discussion on Bioenergy Project Finance Guidelines” was organised by LCORE on Thursday, 31 March 2016 in Jakarta in order to gather inputs and perspectives from experts and financial institutions for the Guidelines and to follow-up on some of the discussions during the programme “Dialogue with Experts and Practitioners in Germany on Renewable Energy Finance” which took place on 6 – 13 March 2016 in Frankfurt.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
	The objective of the Bioenergy Project Finance Guidelines is to structure the requirements of concerned public stakeholders and private financial institutions on project development documentations in order to enable investments and sound operations of new bioenergy power plants in Indonesia.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
	It is estimated that an investment of about 13.5 billion USD would be needed in order to achieve the bioenergy target of 5.4 GW installed capacity by 2025. In addition, it is also estimated that around 30 project proposals would have to be assessed and approved per year by DG NREEC and PLN (the Indonesian State-owned Electricity Company) if the ambitious target is to be met.&nbsp;</div>

	<span style="text-align: justify;">As part of the support to strengthen the technical capacity of the Directorate General New, Renewable Energy, and Energy Conservation (DG NREEC) on Renewable Energy (RE) and Energy Efficiency (EE) project finance, LCORE and Green Chillers project under Energy Programme Indonesian/ASEAN – jointly implemented by DG NREEC and GIZ on behalf of the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB), participated in 5-day summer academy on Climate and Sustainable Energy Finance hosted by Frankfurt School, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Germany.&nbsp; The course was held on 25-29 July 2016 and participated by more than 30 participants from various countries.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	The training provided participants broader knowledge and information on the impact of recent international climate negotiations, policies and sources of financing to scale up and unlock climate finance, the linkages between public and private sector finance and financial modelling. The participants also learned about RE and EE projects from other countries through interactive sessions on project design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	Participants from DG NREEC were very satisfied with the course as said by Mr. Harris Yahya, Deputy Director for Business Development for Energy Conservation, “this course provides me new insight on financial modelling which will be useful to understand the technical aspects of EE projects in Indonesia”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	As continuation of the capacity building measure, participants from DG NREEC and GIZ conducted a delegation visit on 1-2 August 2016 in Berlin, Germany. The Indonesian delegation visited Germany main actors in RE sector in which was facilitated by Renewable Academy (RENAC). This visit was aiming at strengthening the role of DJ-EBTKE as policy maker to set up the enabling conditions for RE development in Indonesia and to exchange knowledge on the RE policy framework in relevance to energy transition in Germany, focussing on 3 (three) aspects which are policy, financing, and technical aspects.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	The institutions visited during the two-days delegation visit are German Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation, and Nuclear Safety (BMUB), German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi), German Biogas Association, The German Energy Agency (DENA), Agora Energiewende, Berliner Energieagentur, and Berliner Wasserbetriebe. The meetings with the German federal ministries focusing more on the German climate policy and government support measure for sustainable energy through International Climate Initiative (IKI). The meeting also discussed on the fields of action in the German energy transition such as energy export initiative. Here the Indonesian delegation was provided with deeper information on the practical implementation by the German biogas association and the Energieagentur. The association also shared their experience on the scheme and implementation of RE projects through agency outside government bodies and how these agencies support the whole industries to reach the government target. The visit was then continued to a biogas generation in the wastewater treatment plant Schönelinde operatedby Berliner Wasserbetriebe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	To summarise, both training and the visits were very interesting and useful for project finance implementation in Indonesia. “The delegation visit gave me insights on how renewable energy policies shall be structured in order to promote private sector and educational institutions involvement, and how the policies and target of government translated into a real projects in the market” said Mr. Iryan Permana, the Head of cooperation sub-division from Directorate Bioenergy.&nbsp;</p>
