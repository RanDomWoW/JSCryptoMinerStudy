        <h2>New on Fuel-Economy.co.uk!</h2>
		
		We know it has taken a long time so please accept our apologies in taking so long to update the car database.  A long wait it may have been, but it is certainly worth the wait!  We've added <strong>over 6,500 vehicles to the database</strong>, with some new entrants from the likes of Hummer and Dodge as well as the latest updates from more familiar brands - such as Citroen's C4 EGS.
		<br/>
		We plan to make some more changes to the site soon, so please keep checking!
