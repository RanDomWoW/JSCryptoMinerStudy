<p>Cricket betting online through sportsbook sites means free bets, regular access to cricket betting odds and much more.</p>
<p>When registering with bookmakers like betway, bet365 and betfair, you get more than a cricket match and a bet slip to add bets; online sportbooks have rewarding bonuses to encourage punters with their betting. Apart from 15-20% deposit bonus, there are a long list of all major tournaments covered with their betting odds and live play. You can do multiple betting with one bet slip or simply follow the odds and bet small; online cricket betting is the platform for everyone.</p>

<p>When the question is asked what is online cricket betting, there are numerous answers with description on formats and betting options but the simplest answer is - online cricket betting is the bet placed on a game of a bat and a ball, played among 22 players with 11 on each team. Punters or the fans who place the bet on this game have to guess which player will play the best, which team will play the best or if it would all go to a draw. This simple form of wagering, thanks to many many bookmakers online, has now expanded to a variety of bet types ranging from bets on Toss, runs, batsman, bowler, team, 6s, 4s, duck and much more.</p>

<h2>Popular Cricket Format</h2>
<p>When Cricket was introduced it was merely a raw form of modern Test Cricket, but this game has now traveled a long way to find itself being played in different formats, played among different tournaments and leagues. While the gentlemen prefer the classic Test formats, younger crowd has found itself madly invested in more faster formats like One Day Cricket and the fastest playing format T-20 Cricket.</p>
<p>Cricket betting varies for each format and so does the strategies and results. You cannot use same online cricket betting strategy for both Test and One day or One day and Twenty-Twenty games.</p>

<h2>Betting on One Day Cricket</h2>
<p>One Day Cricket or popularly known as ODI, when played between different countries, is the most loved game format among domestic and international plays, as it tests the limit of a batsman or a bowler by forcing them to play 50 overs of game play, while trying to break records and stopping the opponent from doing the same. This form of cricket is both fast paced yet lengthy at the same time. What makes this 50 overs format testing is the fact that players cannot afford to play slow or fast.</p>
<p>This classic short game format of cricket is played for 50 overs for each side. Two teams of 11 players each taking turns to bat and ball for a period of 50 overs, except of course if the balling team ends up taking batting side all out before completion of 50 overs.</p>
<p>The limitations on fielding are important for not only on-field team, but also for the punters ready to bet on the hitters. With only 2 fielders outside the inner circle for first 10 overs, the scope of hitters swinging it hard is high and so are the odds for 4s, 6s and scoring pace. These different field restrictions from overs to overs as per the game format define the probability and chances of low runs, high runs, big shots, dot balls and so.</p>
<p>Always pick a sportsbook that cover all ongoing One Day International and Domestic matches, read as many predictions or previews as you can, follow the odds for judgment on who is market's favorite. If available make use of free bets on online ODI betting.</p>
<p>The betting format for ODI is way different from the Test format, with punters largely focused on number of sixes, number of fours, centuries or double centuries, 1st wicket method, runs in 1st over, total run outs, highest individual score and so on. These may or may not also be seen in Test format but are highly relevant to ODI betting format.</p>

<h2>Betting on Test Cricket</h2>
<p>Test Cricket was the origin of the game and till now has held the grace of this sports with its 5 days format. Online cricket betting on Test format is completely different from the shorter formats like One Day or T-20 for the very reason that the game is long and both the sides play twice, with at least 90 overs to go through.</p>
<p>The probability of a Draw is often high in Test match format than its shorter counterparts which is one of the many reasons Test match cricket betting is different. The game play of 5 days with 90 and more overs to be played in morning, afternoon and evening game sessions makes Test match a more complex, but thriller version of One Day format.</p>
<p>Test betting has its own market and often the individual scores of the team or a playing side is the favorite for punters. The Test cricket betting odds play a main role when selecting a bet market.</p>
<p>Unlike One Day, the betting market for Test cricket has way more options to put money on. You can bet on the popular ODI type market like Man of the match, Top bowler, Toss winner, Highest score, Team to win or expand your betting range to markets like Batsman to score a century in 1st inning, Draw, Batsman to score 50 in 1st inning, Batsman to score double century,. etc. Over/Under line is a quite popular bet market for Test followers who tend to place their money on this kind with the match on, keeping their eyes on the wickets falling.</p>

<h2>Betting on T-20 Cricket</h2>
<p>T-20 or Twenty-Twenty is the evolution of this sports to another level; a more fierce & fast format of 20 overs per team, T-20 Cricket is where the bet market needs more attention. The pace at which this game format is played, betting decisions cannot be taken with same calculation used to place money on other cricket formats.</p>
<p>Like ODI, 20-20 too has its own restrictions for fielding team thus adding pressure to the balling side. But with the fielders focused inside of the line, the batsmen too have the pressure of making the best of the initial 5-6 overs by hitting as freely as they can. This ping-pong format of hitting every ball creates an electrifying environment for players, audience as well as the punters looking forward to make quick bucks out of this fast-furious type game format.</p>
<p>The power play is where a large number of betting decisions are based and so is the Toss. Bet market here is all about the current form of the players in the game. While Over/Under runs line is popular, the bet market for T20 cricket betting has all the major markets like Total Sixes, Total Fours, Highest Score, 1st Wicket Down method, 1st Wicket Down runs and even the exciting Super Over bet which can only be seen in this short and super fast format of cricket.</p>
<p>Played by two teams, 11 players and 20 overs each side, T-20 has become a a major tournament in online betting industry.</p>

<h2>Cricket leagues and Tournaments Around the World</h2>

</div> <!-- End Question -->
<div class="answer">

<span class="quesico">Q3</span>
<h4>Why do I have to send in ID documents to the betting sites?</h4>
</div> <!-- End Question -->
<div class="answer">
<p>Bookmakers or Cricket betting sites are required to comply with few legal procedures and regulations which is inclusive of, but not limited to, documentations.<span class="morebtn collapsemore morefaq" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq3" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq3">[More]</span> </p>

<div class="collapse" id="faq3">
<div class="wrapcollapse">
<p> Thus, all reputed sites will ask you for ID documents and other necessary documents as per country's law to ensure you are real person trying to sign up and create an account. Betting laws require bookmakers to ensure proper documentation is done with new account holder to tackle money laundering and other illegal activities.

<div class="question">
<span class="quesico">Q4</span>
<h4>How can I use my free bet and welcome bonus?</h4>
</div> <!-- End Question -->
<div class="answer">
<p>Free bets, which often come as part of Welcome Bonus, are like bonus points that can be redeemed on various bet products depending upon the terms of the bookmaker.<span class="morebtn collapsemore morefaq" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq4" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq4">[More]</span></p>
<div class="collapse" id="faq4">
<div class="wrapcollapse">
<p>Each betting site has its own conditions for Free bets which can be used as bonus or extra balance, to be used for further betting in some bet market. These are often found in bet slip, thus when you adding stakes you get an option asking if you wish to use your Free Bets or bonus. Often bet products that are open to Free bets are restricted to other promotions. You must check Free bet or promotions related T&Cs of your betting site before you place your stake. <span class="morebtn collapseless morefaq" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq4" aria-controls="faq4">[Less]</span></p>
