She’s been a part of the program for 3 years now and she feels lucky to have been given a grant that gives inner city youth the opportunity to be exposed to so many different types of sports that they wouldn&#8217;t have been able to do given their socioeconomic status.</p><p>Sophey plays volleyball, basketball, track, cross country, yoga (if that counts) and has started to get into a few new sports recently due to the grant. She plans to go straight into college and major in business marketing and advertising. Sophey would like to continue what she’s learned with the Youth Institute and school by going into the advertising and marketing industry.</p><p>Something else that Sophey is extremely passionate about is equal-opportunities for all. And with this grant, she is able to explore some things that are classified as “upper-class activities.” This is a start to even the playing field and she like to thank the LA84 Foundation for choosing the Youth Institute and giving her and her peers these incredible opportunities.</p></div>

<p>Janet Evans is widely considered to be the greatest female distance swimmer in history.  Despite her small size and unorthodox windmill stroke, she was a natural-born swimmer, completing laps by the age of two. In 1987, when she was 15 years old, Janet burst onto the international swimming scene, breaking world records in the 400m, 800m and the 1500m freestyle.</p><p>A year later at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, Janet won gold medals in all three of her races: the 400 meter freestyle, 800 meter freestyle, and 400 meter individual medley. In 1992 in Barcelona, Janet defended her gold in the 800 freestyle and added a silver medal in the 400 freestyle. At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Janet swam in both the 400 meter and 800 meter freestyle but failed to medal. The highlight of those Games came at the Opening Ceremonies, where she passed the Olympic Flame to Muhammad Ali. Through that once in a lifetime opportunity, she saw another side of the Olympic experience which changed her forever. She retired from competitive swimming at the end of the Atlanta Games.</p><p>During her career, Janet broke a total of seven world records in three events (400 meter, 800 meter, and 1500 meter freestyle). Her 1500 meter world record stood for 20 years, her 800 world record stood for 21 years, and her 400 world record stood for 19 years, making them some of the longest standing records on the swimming books. Janet was inducted into the US Olympic Hall of Fame in 2004 and the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 2001. In 1989, she was awarded the prestigious Sullivan Award as the United States’ top amateur athlete.</p><p>In 2010, Janet mounted a comeback in the sport with the goal of competing at the Olympic Trials in 2012 in the 400 meter and 800 meter freestyle. She successfully qualified for the Trials, and, at the age 40, had the recent honor of trying out for the Olympic Team in both events in July of 2012.</p><p>More recently, in September of 2015, Janet was selected to be the primary athlete voice of the Los Angeles 2024 Olympic Bid. As the Vice Chair of the Bid Committee and Head of the Athletes’ Commission, she worked closely with Paralympians and Olympians to ensure they were effectively represented in the city’s bid for the Games.  She will continue her role with the newly formed LA2028 Organizing Committee, as her team works to ensure that the athletes of the world have the best possible athlete experience at the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p><p>Out of the pool, Janet has also made a name for herself as a commercial spokesperson, author, reality television personality, and a highly sought after motivational speaker. Her first book, &#8220;Janet Evans&#8217; Total Swimming,” was published in 2007 and offers fitness programs, workouts, and proper swim techniques to readers. </p><p>Janet executes speeches for top companies in varying fields including: Technology, Healthcare, Real Estate, Telecommunications, Apparel, Banking, Insurance, non-profits and many others. She lives in Southern California with her husband Billy and their two young children, Sydney and Jake.</p></div>

<p>Jake Olson is 20 years old, a resident of Huntington Beach, California and is attending USC as a junior.  When Jake was 8 months old, he was diagnosed with a rare form of eye cancer, retinoblastoma. The disease claimed his left eye before the tender age of one and in November 2009 Jake lost his right eye after battling the cancer for 12 years.  Jake confronted many challenges during his battle and has used his experience to better himself as a person and develop a strong faith in God.  Jake wrote a book when he was 8 years old to uplift and encourage other children who were battling cancer and other diseases.  Jake has shared his book and faith with countless others, including both adults and children that have been touched by his story.  Jake has also just published his second book, “Open Your Eyes”, which was released January 2014.  He has a wholesomeness to his heart and spirit for life beyond his years. </p><p>Jake is also a life-long University of Southern California football fan. He had the opportunity to meet the entire coaching staff and team as well as spend precious moments with the team leading up to his surgery and the weeks that followed.  Meeting Coach Carroll and the team was a special experience for both Jake and the Trojans.  These relationships assisted Jake beyond measure during some of his most trying times and some of these relationships have grown into special friendships – especially with Coach Carroll. Jake attended the Super Bowl last year and spent some precious moments with Coach Carroll leading up to the big game.  During the Trojan season in 2009 and leading up to Jake’s surgery, ESPN’s Shelly Smith captured his story alongside the Trojans, his battle with cancer and his courage in a short documentary.  This piece has been aired on ESPN, Good Morning America; ABC’s Evening News and won an ESPY award.  Jake was also a guest commentator on ESPN&#8217;s College Game Day show for the January 1, 2010 New Years’ Day show.  In October 2011, Jake and his emerging golf game were featured on Fox’s “Live Life &#038; Win.” Jake was also featured on The Katie Couric Show called “Miracles”,  the Home and Family show on Hallmark,  Fox and Friends and CBS nightly news.</p><p>With Jake’s recent fame, he had the opportunity to share his book and speak about his experiences and faith in front of corporations, schools, service organizations and congregations.  In January 2010 and 2014, Jake was a showcased speaker, alongside legendary coach Bobby Bowden, for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes National Event held in Irvine, California.  Jake was also a keynote speaker at <strong>Dick Vitale’s 5th Annual V Foundation for Cancer Research Event held in Sarasota, Florida and has had several opportunities to speak for the benefit of </strong>The American Cancer Society. Jake has been in front of corporations and service organizations with audience sizes in excess of 10,000 guests.</p><p>Jake recognizes he has received much, and wants to give back more.  In this spirit, Jake setup his own foundation – Out-of-Sight Faith – in order to raise needed funds to purchase technology for other blind children.  This equipment and technology enable visually impaired children to perform better in school and achieve academic excellence. The foundation also supports cancer research and has raised over $100,000 dollars.  Jake is also an honorary member of two other non-profit boards: 1) Tee off for Dogs which sponsors guide dogs for the visually impaired, and 2) Cancer Research &#038; Know-the-Glow campaign in connection with the Vision Center at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles.</p><p> Jake played football and golf in high school and is currently on the USC football team as one of the long snappers. During USC’s game against Western Michigan on September 2<sup> </sup>, 2017, Jake made history as the first one hundred percent blind player to snap in a college football game. It was a dream come true for Jake, and his story inspired millions of people all across the county.</p><p>On top of football, he also enjoys skiing, surfing and playing the guitar.  Jake has set a personal goal to become the first blind golfer to join the PGA golf tour.  Jake’s love for and dedication to the game of golf caught the attention of TravisMathew golf clothing company.  Jake and TravisMathew have teamed up to develop a first of its kind “Braille” golf shirt, with messages scripted in Braille on shirts that offer golfers a smart, progressive look with a sizeable portion of the proceeds from every shirt sold going to Jake’s favorite charities. </p><p>Jake loves to help and serve others.  Jake is not afraid to challenge himself or challenge others and has personally raised his expectations for his own life. Jake&#8217;s faith and attitude have been an inspiration to others and his belief in making the most out of life continues to motivate those around him. Jake can be followed at <u>Open Your Eyes.

<p>2012 Paralympian Mallory Weggemann had her life changed on January 21, 2008. On that date, Mallory Weggemann received an epidural injection to help treat back pain; however, by the time it was finished, she was forever changed. Complications with the procedure left the college freshman paralyzed from the belly-button down.</p><p>Weggemann has been a competitive swimmer since the age of seven. After her injury at the age of 18, Weggemann chose to return to the pool. In April 2008, her older sister found an article in the local newspaper highlighting the Paralympic Swimming Trials for the Beijing 2008 Paralympic Games. The meet was being held at the University of Minnesota Aquatics Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Still coping with her new disability, Weggemann found one thing unchanged, her love for swimming.</p><p>While attending the meet as a spectator with her sister, she met several of the US National Team coaches. The following Monday, Weggemann returned to the pool and has been swimming ever since. She touts her Paralympic trials experience as life changing. “I have always loved the sport, but when this happened I thought my days of swimming were over and when I realized I could still do it, well I will never forget that moment.” Weggemann broke her first set of world records in Edmonton, Alberta Canada in July 2009. At the 2009 Short Course IPC Swimming World Championships in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in November 2009, Weggemann broke six more world records and took home five gold medals. In August 2010, at the Long Course IPC Swimming World Championships in Eindhoven, Netherlands, Weggemann proved herself again in the pool by taking home eight gold medals and one silver. Weggemann finished the meet with nine World Records. In July of 2011, Mallory was recognized for her outstanding performance at the 2010 World Championships by ESPN, when she was awarded the ESPN ESPY for Best Female Athlete with a Disability.</p><p>In August 2012, just days after being reclassified at the 2012 Paralympic Games in London, Mallory showcased her amazing abilities by winning gold and setting a Paralympic Record in the 50m freestyle. Mallory also anchored the bronze medal winning 4x100m medley relay team, bringing USA back from fifth place to almost capturing gold! It has been deemed one of the most memorable moments of the London Games, and it inspired many across the world.</p><p>Just under four months after becoming paralyzed Mallory was back in the pool, with her eyes on Gold at the 2012 Paralympic Games. Having achieved that goal, she decided it was time to chase her ultimate dream, to walk again. For years, this was something that was deemed impossible, but a new possibility arose and in order to achieve her goal, Mallory reached out to the public to ask for their support through a crowd funding Indiegogo campaign. On November 16, 2013 Mallory’s dream came true, and she was able to “walk” again for the first time in nearly six years with her loved ones by her side. In order to accomplish this dream Mallory worked very closely with Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN to learn how to use her customized leg braces with the assistance of forearm crutches.  Although, Mallory’s wheelchair will never be replaced by her customized leg braces and forearm crutches, they have allowed her to have short moments of upright mobility and the freedom of standing at her 5’ 9” stature again. </p><p>Currently, Weggemann just returned home from the the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and competed in an unprecedented seven individual events, while representing Team USA in her second Paralympic Games this past September. In addition, Mallory is actively building upon her career outside of the pool as a highly sought-after motivational speaker, writing and other public appearances around the world. Mallory is currently publishing her work monthly for the Huffington Post on various motivational, inspirational and leadership topics and heavily involved in disability advocacy efforts on Capitol Hill, as well as serving as a board member on Delta Airlines Disability Advisory Board. Mallory is also being featured in <em>The Current</em>, a documentary produced by Make A Hero, a non-profit organization focused on inspiring individuals with disabilities to enjoy the freedom of adaptive sports.</p></div>

<p>Vinicius &#8220;Vina&#8221; Tinoco was born in Sᾶo Paulo, Brazil in 1981.  He began skateboarding at 12 years old and by 23 was volunteering as a mentor to troubled youth in a juvenile detention center teaching life lessons through skateboarding.  These same lessons combined with near life-long support from his community helped Vina formulate a vision for his own life&#8217;s mission.  In 2006 he traveled to California intent upon infiltrating the &#8220;ground zero&#8221; of skateboarding, and the concept for Next Up Foundation was born.  It is Vina&#8217;s dream to instill in the world the kinds of qualities that skateboarding taught him…resilience, dedication, balance, passion, humility, camaraderie, the list goes on.  Next Up empowers underprivileged youth by connecting them to education through skateboarding and creating opportunity for success never before imagined.  Today the organization has served over 15,000 participants and is growing.  We are excited to include Vina&#8217;s unique perspective on the sport of skateboarding in today&#8217;s panel.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Tiffany Berry received her PhD in Developmental Psychology &#038; Evaluation, specializing in the development of intrinsic motivation among youth who participate in afterschool programs. This research led to her working as an Internal Evaluation Consultant for one of the nation’s largest after-school programs, Los Angeles’s Better Educated Students for Tomorrow (LA’s BEST) where she initiated an evaluation infrastructure to facilitate continuous quality improvement. Since 2004, Dr. Berry has been dually appointed as a Research Associate Professor in the Division of Behavioral &#038; Organizational Sciences at Claremont Graduate University (CGU) and Associate Director of the Claremont Evaluation Center. She regularly teaches graduate courses in program evaluation and positive developmental science, trains graduate students in evaluation science, and evaluates youth development programs trying to make a meaningful difference in the lives of young people.</p><p>Over the past 15 years, Dr. Berry has directed more than 75 program evaluations across a range of content areas (e.g., college readiness, youth sports, social-emotional learning, afterschool programs) and diverse agencies such as Beyond the Bell at the Los Angeles Unified School District, After School All-Stars, Los Angeles, Montebello Unified School District, Project GRAD Los Angeles, Youth Empowerment Seminar, Los Angeles County Office of Education, First Five Los Angeles, National Endowment for Financial Education, The Gabriella Foundation, and Pearson Education. These evaluations have been designed to drive organizational improvement, identify critical conditions for success, and track optimal youth outcomes over time. More recently, she has partnered with LAUSD and the LA84 Foundation to evaluate the middle school sports program in LAUSD to understand the impact of high-quality school-based youth sports programs as well as how and why youth outcomes emerge during sports participation.</p><p>Since 2004, Dr. Berry and her colleagues have disseminated their evaluations broadly. She has published over 75 technical evaluation reports, published peer-reviewed articles in leading evaluation journals (<em>American Journal of Evaluation and New Directions for Evaluation</em>) and youth development journals (<em>Journal of Early Adolescence</em>), and presented her findings annually at scientific and practitioner conferences. In 2014, Dr. Berry was appointed to the Evaluation and Research Advisory Committee (ERAC) with the Afterschool Division of the California Department of Education. In this capacity, Dr. Berry worked to ensure that evaluations across the state were useful, feasible, and promote continuous quality improvement. More recently, Dr. Berry was appointed to the Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) workgroup at the California Afterschool Network.</p></div>

<p>Selema “Sal” Masekela is a beloved commentator, journalist, musician, and producer best known for his work presenting NBC’s Red Bull Signature Series; ESPN’s Summer and Winter X Games, which he hosted for 13 years; his cultural reporting in South Africa during the 2010 FIFA World Cup; and hosting E!’s <em>Daily 10</em>.</p><p>Selema is currently executive producing and appearing as host in VICELAND’s highly-anticipated docu-series, <em>VICE World of Sports,</em> which premiered April 27<sup>th</sup>, 2016. The series takes viewers all over the world to explore each location’s people, politics, and culture through the lens of the one thing that connects them all: sports. The series premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 22<sup>nd</sup>, and according to Deadline.com “Always much harder to make than they look, sports documentaries and sports investigations score when they take the viewer beyond the stats and even the athletes and into the context that creates the competitor and the game – and that’s what VWOS has nicely done.”</p><p>Selema’s creativity and mastery of storytelling extends behind the camera to his production company, UX Entertainment. Based in Los Angeles, UXE specializes in film, commercials, music videos, and animation work. The award-winning work of UXE puts it in elite company amongst the boutique production firms in entertainment and sports. Their latest project, <em>Let It Play: Hard Lovin’ Woman</em>, a heavy-hitting documentary featuring the never been told story of Oscar-nominated actress Juliette Lewis, will premiere at Tribeca in the Short Film program on April 15<sup>th</sup>. Launching globally on Red Bull TV on April 23<sup>rd</sup>, the short film, developed in association with Red Bull and directed by actor and director Michael Rapaport, explores the sacrifices Lewis makes to pursue her first love, music—from putting her acting career on hold and self-financing a music career to assembling her very own rock band, The Licks.</p><p>On the sports front, in 2015, Selema joined the Emmy-award winning investigative series VICE on HBO as a correspondent and executive producer. That year, he also appeared in the remake of the cult classic <em>Point Break</em>. In February 2014, he made his Olympic broadcasting debut from the Winter Olympics in Sochi, reporting features for NBC’s nationally syndicated <em>Olympic Zone</em>. In 2012, Selema helped launch the one-of-a-kind action sports programming block <em>Red Bull Signature Series (RBSS)</em> for NBC Sports and its action sports brand Alli. As the face of <em>RBSS</em> he navigates viewers through extreme competitions in motorsports, bike, surf, and snow. In addition to <em>RBSS</em>, Selema also produces and develops original content for the multi-platform media company Red Bull Media House.</p><p>When he was a teenager, Selema’s unique upbringing brought him to Southern California, where he was first exposed to surfing, snowboarding, and skateboarding. His love for sports, extraordinary athletes, and the culture surrounding them gave Selema the unparalleled perspective he used to become today’s media authority on action sports. His ability to relate to athletes and tell their stories in a humanizing, personal way that resonates with viewers has made him a favorite not only within the action sports community, but with everyone on the receiving end of his remarkable insights.</p><p>A native of New York, Selema’s flair for entertainment emerged at an early age as he toured the world with his father, South African jazz icon Hugh Masekela. Selema’s own band, <em>Alekesam</em>, shares the name of his first film which chronicles his relationship with his father and their connection through music, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2012. <em>Alekesam</em>’s music has been featured on <em>Entourage</em> and <em>House of Lies</em>, with their newest single, <em>All Is Forgiven</em>, featured on the season four premiere of the Showtime hit.</p><p>His creative aesthetics also extend into fashion through his clothing company, <em>Art of Craft</em>, which donates a percentage of every sale to charity. Selema is often called upon to apply his encompassing and captivating style of hosting to live events, including YouTube’s Brandcast in New York and Paris, YouTube Live on Stage from the Kennedy Center, and Google’s Zeitgeist.</p><p>In addition to his hosting, producing, acting, writing, fashion and voiceover work, Selema offers his name and time to the charity he co-founded, <em>Stoked Mentoring</em>, a nonprofit action sports organization for at-risk youth whose mission is “developing successful teens with opportunity, knowledge, experience, and determination through the use of action sports, mentoring, and coaching.” He also serves on the board of the Tony Hawk Foundation.</p></div>

<p><strong>Liz Wolfson</strong>, the fourth child in a family of competitive athletes, was reared on a backyard basketball court where she learned how to use both hands for lay-ups and to never let her brothers knock her down. Always the quiet rebel, Liz hated being told what to do by anybody and decided not to settle on the career path in organizational management set before her. At age 40 with a newborn in her arms, she thought it the perfect time to start up her dream project that would model for her children what it would mean to vision, create, struggle, and succeed. Feeling that the educational opportunities for girls in America were insufficient to match the reality of growing up in today’s world, Liz became the Chief Visionary Officer of the Girls Athletic Leadership Schools Inc., a game-changing educational model focused on positive gender identity and integrated movement. </p></div>

<p>John J. Ratey, MD, is an Associate Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and an internationally recognized expert in Neuropsychiatry. He has published over 60 peer-reviewed articles, and 11 books published in 15 languages, including the groundbreaking ADHD “Driven to Distraction” series with Ned Hallowell, MD. With the publication of &#8220;Spark-The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain,&#8221; Dr. Ratey has established himself as one of the world&#8217;s foremost authorities on the brain-fitness connection. His latest book, “Go Wild”, explores how we can achieve optimal physical and mental health by getting in touch with our caveman roots, and how we can “re-wild” our lives.</p><p> John grew up in the steel working town of Beaver, Pennsylvania, overcoming the odds to become a ranked tennis player in High School, competing in the US National Juniors before being offered a tennis scholarship to college. He attended Colgate University, where he received his BA in philosophy before moving to Boston. Finding work at Harvard’s Massachusetts Mental Center as an attendant, John was often assigned with caring for some of the most difficult patients, inspiring him to learn more about how to help those with mental health challenges.  Seeing a career in Psychiatry as the path, he completed his science requirements at Harvard before returning to his home state to attend the University of Pittsburgh Medical School. Circling back to Harvard for his Psychiatric training, upon graduation John was appointed Harvard’s Assistant Director of Residency and Medical Student Training, a position he held for 9 years.  It was during these early years at Harvard Medical School that he began his groundbreaking research on aggression, autism and ADD, leading to a career of speaking and teaching around the world.  </p><p>Dr. Ratey’s work in Attention Deficit Disorder came after he and his former student, Ned Hallowell, recognized and diagnosed their own ADD, prompting them to write a book to raise awareness and an understanding of the diagnosis to a lay audience. Published in 1994, “Driven to Distraction” became a bestseller, with over 2 million copies in print, and is still considered one of the Bibles of ADD today.  Dr. Ratey and Dr. Hallowell went on to write “Delivered to Distraction” and “Answers to Distraction”, and have become recognized around the world as authorities on the subject. They continue to collaborate and are currently working on a new book.</p><p>As an author, Dr. Ratey’s other groundbreaking work includes, “A Users’ Guide to the Brain” and “Shadow Syndromes” with Catherine Johnson PhD. With the publication of “Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain”, Dr. Ratey has embarked on a world-wide mission to re-engineer schools, corporations, and individual lifestyle practices by incorporating exercise to achieve peak performance and optimum mental health.  A highly sought after speaker, Dr. Ratey has lectured extensively on the subject throughout the US, Canada, Asia, Australia and Europe. His work is frequently profiled in the media, where he’s been featured on ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS and NPR, as well as in The New York Times, Newsweek, The Washington Post, US News and World Report, Men’s Health, and other national publications.</p><p>Dr. Ratey has spread his message as an Adjunct Professor of Sport Science at the National Taiwan Sport University, and as a consultant to the President of Taiwan and the Minister of Education in South Korea.  He has served at co-head of the Advisory Board of the California Governor&#8217;s Council on Physical Fitness and Sport, a consultant to ANTA Kids in China, and on Reebok’s non-profit before school fitness program, BOKS, where he was named Ambassador for Active Kids. In addition, he has a non-profit, Sparking Life, with a mission to transform America’s sedentary lifestyle for the benefit of all.</p><p>While he enjoys writing and lecturing, first and foremost, John is a Psychiatrist who cares deeply about his patients.  Recognized by his peers as one of the Best Doctors in America since 1997, he was recently named “Outstanding Psychiatrist of 2016” by the Massachusetts Psychiatric Society.  Married, with two children and two grandchildren, Dr. Ratey maintains a private practice in both Cambridge, Massachusetts and Los Angeles, California.</p></div>

<p>Born on November 18, 1985, Allyson Felix grew up in Los Angeles, California. Her father, Paul, is an ordained minister who was an excellent sprinter as a teen. She inherited her long legs from her school teacher mother, Marlean. Allyson followed her older brother, Wes, into the sport, although she did not try out for the track team until her ninth-grade year at Los Angeles Baptist High School in North Hills.</p><p>At her first practice Coach Jonathon Patton asked her to run 40-meters and thought he must have mis-measured the distance when he saw Allyson’s time. He re-measured and asked her to run again, and she did, but with the same results. Just ten weeks after that tryout, Allyson was racing at the California State Finals.</p><p>Allyson went on to accomplish impressive feats over her high school career. She broke Marion Jones’ high-school 200-meter record by running 22.51 seconds at the Mt. San Antonio College Relays in April of 2003. Just weeks later, Felix turned in an even more impressive performance when she competed in the Banamex Grand Prix in Mexico City’s Olympic Stadium and ran a blazing 22.11 second 200-meter race, which was a new world record in the under-20 category.</p><p>Felix emerged as the new American Female sprinter to watch and has never looked back winning three gold medals in the 2012 London Olympic Games and followed that up in 2016 with two more gold medals and another Silver Medal. Under the tutelage of Coach Bob Kersee, she has won a total of six Olympic gold medals and is now the most decorated female track &#038; field Olympian in history.</p></div>
