                <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to
                    post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or
                    company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting
                    personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy
                    on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is
                    being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at:
