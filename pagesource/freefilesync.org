				FreeFileSync is a folder comparison and synchronization software that creates and manages backup
				copies of all your important files. Instead of copying every file every time, FreeFileSync determines the
				differences between a source and a target folder and transfers only the minimum amount of data needed.

				FreeFileSync is Open Source software, available for Windows, Linux and macOS.<br>

					Cross-Platform File and Folder Synchronization Software adds Support for FTP and FTPS<br>
<br>
FreeFileSync (https://www.freefilesync.org) has released version 9.1 of its free open source file synchronization utility for Windows, Linux, and macOS.<br>
<br>
The new version supports synchronization via FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and the encrypted variant FTPS (SSL/TLS). This further enhances FreeFileSync's capabilities to not only work with local drives and network shares but also synchronize mobile and cloud storage.<br>
<br>
FreeFileSync eliminates the tedious and error-prone task of manually identifying files that have changed on the source folder and copying them to the target folder, no matter what protocol is used to access files. Users can set up mirror, two-way, or custom synchronization rules, and then create batch jobs that run the sync without requiring manual interaction. Batch jobs can be started with a simple mouse double-click or triggered automatically by a task scheduler.<br>
<br>
FreeFileSync detects moved files and reproduces the move on the target drive. This avoids time consuming file copy and delete operations and instead completes the task with a single hard drive access. This even works in mirror synchronization scenarios where the target file system does not support file IDs (e.g. FTP/SFTP) or has unstable file IDs (e.g. FAT).<br>
<br>
FreeFileSync includes features that are normally found only in the premium versions of commercial applications. It can copy locked files using the Volume Shadow Copy Service, compare file content in binary mode, handle symbolic links and run real two-way synchronizations including detecting conflicts and propagating deletions. FreeFileSync fully supports long file paths with more than 260 characters, copies NTFS extended attributes, security permissions and alternate data streams. The application takes advantage of 64-bit and multiple CPU cores if available and is fully Unicode compatible.<br>
<br>
FreeFileSync supports MTP (Media Transfer Protocol), making it easy for users to synchronize files and folders between their PCs and their iPad, iPhone, Android smartphone, tablet, digital camera, digital audio players, or other MTP devices. The tool is fully integrated with Windows Explorer and allows users to jump to their MTP files in Explorer, open them directly with their default application, or to drag and drop MTP folders from Explorer into FreeFileSync.<br>
FreeFileSync supports FTP, FTPS, SFTP, enabling web developers to publish changes to their local website copy by running a FreeFileSync batch job - with only a double-click of the mouse.<br>
<br>
The software has been optimized for usability and performance. It can scan a hard drive with hundreds of thousands of files in a few seconds, while scanning multiple folders in parallel. The synchronization steps are laid out in the optimal order that minimizes peaks in disk space consumption and FreeFileSync's fail-safe file copy algorithm prevents data corruption when the synchronization process is terminated unexpectedly, e.g. due to power loss.<br>
Graphs and detailed messages give relevant feedback and provide structure on multiple visual and textual levels: getting an overview of a hard drive's space distribution can be quickly accomplished by navigating a directory tree showing file count and sizes below each node.<br>
<br>
<br>
Pricing and Availability<br>
<br>
FreeFileSync is available without cost. FreeFileSync runs on Windows XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10, Mac OS X 10.7 and newer, and all major distributions of Linux.<br>

This has to be the most useful free tool ever released. I'm a network administrator and when moving file servers, this tool outperformed Robocopy, Symantec, and many many others.</div>

SO awesome. There's so much I could say about this indispensable program, but I'll just tell you now that the amount of options and different types of sync methods will ensure you are able to do what you need, as well as the ability to save your sync configurations for certain sync jobs, so that you can easily do them in the future.<br><br>Great UI, please don't change it, because too many people are ruining their software these days with some new crap that renders their software useless, literally making it impossible to do anything. Keep up the GREAT work, developers, you really know what you're doing &lt;3 You rock mah socks! ^_^</div>

Excellent, efficient tool for manual backup and folder mirroring. No persistent services. Does what it promises and is updated frequently. Takes advantage of multicore now. A big thanks to the developers.</div>

	I've been looking for a tool like this for about 3 years, when my most favorite directory sync tool stopped development, short of Windows XP. GREAT work on this. Clean, efficient, simple dir comparison or sync. Run it and it shows you what's out of sync, without all of the complicated configurations, etc. that other dir sync tools have. Thanks.</div>

	Amazing program! I love it and use it everyday. Thank you for such a useful and powerful utility. I couldn't run my photography business without it. I make sure all my important files are backed up and it allows me complete control over what gets copied over and when. It's saved me a number of times. Thanks again.</div>

	What an excellent piece of software. Initially deployed as an experiment, has turned into a staple in my toolbox. I have it set up for an hourly mirror sync via Task Scheduler and it has proven itself time and time again. Nearly three million files synced, hourly revisions are kept on another drive and then compressed monthly... this is one beautiful piece of software. Thank you so much.</div>

	With around 2 million files to compare/mirror, a lot of other tools run into problems with memory, long paths or performance (especially 32-bit tools, when the memory needed to represent the internal file lists exceeds the 2GB process memory limit).<br><br>
FreeFileSync not only uses a lot less memory for large numbers of files but also provides a native 64bit build, eliminating any possible memory problems with large numbers of files (unless you run out of physical memory).<br><br>
It also supports long paths, does the file listing in multiple threads (one thread per drive AFAIK) and has just the right amount of configuration options needed to achieve everything without bloating the UI with too many options.<br><br>
Just started using it today, but I'm really impressed already.</div>

	Awesome scalable tool!!!!! This is the only tool I know which can compare and sync 2 directories with more than 11,000,000 files, and not die while syncing.

	Best file sync software I have ever used. I used to run SyncToy 64-bit version, but after running into problems and being unable to fix them (as my file count went up) I decided to try FreeFileSync. To this date, I have not experienced a single problem, not even a hickup. One directory contains over 10 million files, and it runs through with ease.</div>

	After wasting $40+ dollars on a competitor's product, I tried out freefilesync. FreefileSync was able to compare hundreds of thousands of files (NAS->NAS) in 10 minutes, which was taking the competitor's product over 3 hours. I ended up deleting the competitor's product and relying on FreeFileSync. Awesome, awesome backup program.</div>

	This program is excellent. I have been using it between 2 computers for 3 weeks and no issues. I was using SyncToy for a few years with few problems, but recently SyncToy began to delete the newer files, some of which I spent hours writing. Thankfully I found FreeFileSync and it is working perfectly.</div>

	Does pretty much everything I need to do better than MS Synctoy. I had started off with Synctoy hearing good things until I found out it won't copy files that are in use. Now I'm using FreeFileSync to sync my XBMC database from my media center to my regular PC. It works like a charm. I also use it to keep my music synced across 2 computers (I like having it in both places) as well as my Portable Apps. It reads the changes ridiculously quick, copies files in use, and the interface stays relatively responsive.</div>

	FFS is highly capable and very fast. More importantly, it's very reliable: I synchronize about 250K files daily, with typically a few thousand changed and about a 500 MB in size and it has yet to mess up.<br><br>I used to use MS's SyncToy, but that name actually characterizes it all: a "toy". SyncToy would frequently get confused and want to move things in the wrong direction or show conflicts which weren't the case (esp. with MS network share drives).<br><br>One of FFS's strengths is how well it handles conflicts, though I have occasionally wished it had a one-click-for-the-newest button, it's really easy to select a group of files and right-click to send them left or right.<br><br>Also, FFS is orders of magnitude faster than Microsoft's SyncToy for high-latency drives, like WAN drives; synchronizations that would take several hours with SyncToy 2.1 completed in less than 20 minutes using FFS (and that was quite some versions of FSS ago).<br><br>The UI is adequate, with some very minor shortcomings, like not being able to reorder the list of directories being synchronized. Overall it's pretty easy to use, though I think filters and the two settings dialogs could be merged into a single concept / dialog. The ability to hook in an external compare tool is excellent, and it works very well with WinMerge to check exactly what is different between particular files.</div>

	I have been searching (for a long time up to about 2 years ago when I found FreeFileSync) for a utility that does this, even contemplated creating my own. FreeFileSync is a one stop solution that does it all, and does it the way I expect it to. And its versatile and user friendly enough to compare files produced by the engineering tools I use. I've even used it to check disk transfer speed in real life scenarios, works like an absolute charm.<br>It really became a tool I use extremely often, it's one of my must have's like 7zip. It beats "Unison" hands down for user friendliness and speed to install and get on systems. It beats the tool "Beyond Compare" hands down because it's open source and freely available, but I have to say, I'd love the "Beyond Compare" capabilities, but I cannot justify its cost. FFS does enough for me that I can do without it.</div>

	Used to use MS synctoy but it's so out of date you can see there is no future in it. Looks like sync center is the way to go for MS native but I have Windows 7 Home so I don't have that choice. <br><br>Anyway, came across this, judged it on downloads per week and gave it a go. Really impressed, easy to setup and with just a little reading you can get it to do realtime sync with RealTimeSync that comes with it! <br><br>Looks like it's maintained well and kept up to date (big plus) and I like the way it can use Windows Shadow Copy for locked files. Great stuff and thanks!</div>

	I love the simplicity of this. Other programs compress and bundle which is unnecessary and obfuscating. This program is actually easier and simpler than copying folders by hand, because once you've set up your paths and saved them in profiles, you just choose the profile. If you put a little effort in at the beginning working out what needs to be backed up, then the existence of the profile in the list reminds you that you need to do a backup of it.</div>

	Far better than other sync tools for my needs. I was looking for something to backup new and updated games from my Steam library (over 200GB) to an external drive so I can uninstall games to free up space and not have to waste bandwidth re-downloading if I want to play them again. <br><br>With FreeFileSync, the scan/comparison results are presented well with lots of statistics, there are buttons to filter the results view with a single click, and I can exclude folders in the right-click context menu (sub-folders are not expanded automatically). The interface is kept simple by having certain elements context-based - buttons that don't have any use to your current task/step in the sync process are hidden. I accomplished what I was trying to do quickly and didn't need to refer to the help file.<br><br>The previous sync tools I had negative experiences with were DirSync Pro (too complicated) and Microsoft SyncToy (not complicated enough to be useful).</div>

	This is one of those tools you cannot live without. I use FreeFileSync at least twice a day, to update the full backup I keep in a USB stick. Every month I also mirror my work files into a removable USB-2 drive. Once I waited for 3 months to update into my second removable drive and I had to wait for only 25 minutes, even though I had changed a lot of songs and videos. Moreover, my USB stick backups take no more than 3 minutes for a full day of work.<br>The creator of FreeFileSync was kind enough to respond to some suggestions I made, but it's hard to think on improving this program because it is already great!</div>

	I have worked with Vice Versa and FreeFileSync. There is no comparison. FreeFileSync is one of finest and most important applications ever written. It works perfectly and handles a critically important computer task that too few people do. Vice Versa had at least one fatal flaw that was insurmountable: If folders had to be created on the destination side, they were created in all lower-case, regardless of the case of the source side. Consequently, the subsequent compare always failed. Their tech support was supposedly unaware of the problem, could not resolve it, and eventually avoided further contact. FreeFileSync is as good as it gets.</div>

	Great application for all your file/folder comparison and synchronisation needs. Allows you to add multiple, specific source and target folders and use filters to exclude and include specific files and/or sub-paths.<br><br>The generation of a batch script allows you to automate the synchronisation, which you set up in the GUI. It can then run regularly and in the background.<br><br>The synchronisation dialogue is beautiful, showing you the speed at which it happens. Display filters allow you to grasp the changes, and preview stats allow you to see the quantity of changes before-hand (so you don't make a mistake, moving the wrong way around for example).</div>

	Thanks so much for Free File Sync (FFS)!!! Following problem has haunted me for years: Now that I have a 64-bit Win7 Pro OS that supports UNC paths up to 32K I thought the problem would be automatically resolved. But no, the dreaded 260 character path limit was STILL HAUNTING ME DAILY.<br><br>I have tried UNC paths, \?\ trick, SyncToy, Robocopy, Robomirror, Richcopy, and the MS Hotfix for long paths. Nothing worked, all failed for my needs. Then I found FFS. And it just works. I will donate at a later date.</div>

	FreeFileSync is truly a fantastic program and it is portable too. I have installed it on an USB stick. I had been using Syncback for over 5 years. I found that FreeFileSync is the only open source freeware that can match the paid version of Syncback software in terms of speed in handling folders with huge number of files (up to 30Gb). It runs perfectly in Windows XP SP2. Its web site says FreeFileSync can run in Linux as well. Many thanks to the author Mr. Zenju. I am sure this software will in time become an extremely popular download.</div>

	This has become my favorite file synchronization tool. Even Araxis Merge seems to have lost its appeal. FreeFileSync uses some special undocumented APIs to accelerate folder reads, and it shows! Also, with the ability to use 3rd-party tools like WinMerge or RapidCRC to compare at a click, it's pretty simple to view changes before committing.</div>

	This is a brilliant piece of software. It is simple to set up and easy to use. I have been using it for a few months now and it has never crashed. I use it to sync to my Dropbox via BoxCryptor encryption. I don't completely trust auto syncing software, so this is a great alternative. It allows you to keep your original files on your computer, and also save separate back up files on your external drive or Dropbox etc. Well done guys!</div>

	I have used a bunch of backup software, some paid and some free. But, Free File Sync is the simplest most straightforward way to back up files. All I did was copy the pertinent directories to a 1.5 TB USB connected drive, then set up a batch file in FFS to run every day at noon and sync the two directories. Like magic it works flawlessly. And, rather than go through some clunky interface to restore something it is a simple as going to the external drive and copying the files back.</div>

	Since I am a backup paranoiac because I have lost data several times, I want something that is quick and painless. This is super easy to use. It also, since it does not give me an error message, copies all the files that a windows copy and paste would not copy because the file names are too long or they are organized in too many sub-folders (what a hassle that is, but that is another windows problem). Have I confirmed this by testing and verify copying? No. It is easy enough to do, but I am way too busy.<br>Just like people believe in their country and a God, I believe in FreeFileSync. The best part is that you are not spammed with advert pop ups or anything like with other freeware. Thank you so much FreeFileSync!</div>

	I wanted to synchronise a Windows 7 64-bit Notebook, an iMac (Lion) with Samba enabled. I have a lot of data to synchronise, about 150 GB and 200,000 files. I've tried SyncToy from Microsoft, Windows 7 built-in synchronisation center, AlwaySync, Syncback, SkyDrive, and so on... Each of those tools took VERY long in the good case, or hanged in the bad case :-( <br>And I tried FreeFileSync: It does exactly that I wanted to do, and it is really very fast.

	I have tried two other free synchronisation software suites: Synkron (also SourceForge software) and RichCopy (from Microsoft). FreeFileSync is better than both of them for a number of reasons:<br><br>1. Intuitive user interface: I setup a multiple folder synchronisation within minutes! The buttons are clear, and if you aren't exactly sure of their function, hovering the mouse over the buttons will reveal clarifying information.<br><br>2. Informative: I knew exactly what files were being deleted or updated. The initial "compare" function is MUCH clearer and easier to use than Synkron's "analysis" function. Synkron would give no information about the analysis while it was occurring, so you don't know what progress it is making. FreeFileSync lets you know how the comparison is going, and gives a very handy graph to show progress, including file transfer rates, etc...<br><br>3. Stable: I have not yet had FreeFileSync crash on me. RichCopy and Synkron have both crashed, and Synkron tends to freeze the system.<br><br>4. Efficient: Synkron writes the synchronisation files to a backup file for some reason which I could not disable in the settings. This both slows the system down, but also uses up a significant amount of hard drive memory over time, since these files are not deleted. Quite simply the best free synchronisation software I have ever used!</div>

	I have just discovered your wonderful FreeFileSync software. For years I've been using ViceVersa which runs on Windows. Now I have moved everything to Linux, and searched for a ViceVersa replacement in vain. But the discovery of FreeFileSync changed everything. It's BETTER than ViceVersa!! Out goes ViceVersa and I have yet another native Linux app.</div>

	Outstanding program. And it's free!! I have used this program for about 3-4 years now. And it is simply amazing. I had been looking for a program like this for years. The one I used to have was ViceVersa, until it became too expensive. It basically mirrors my important folders over to my NAS (Sylonogy and D-Link). It does such a great job showing exactly what is going to change (delete/add/modify). It's so simple to use, but also customizable. You can change the behaviour of individual files. Simply the best. Zenju did such a good job creating this. Thank you!</div>

	Wow! FreeFileSync is the best backup tool I've ever used! I've bounced back and forth between many tools over the years, and this one is so much simpler (without sacrificing functionality) in so many ways. The backup process is quick and reliable.</div>

	Excellent, works perfectly between my MAC and my corporate server based on a Microsoft environment. The only "bad" point that I see, is the usage of Realtimesync, a tool to automatize the synchronization when a folder becomes available. It's not fully explained how to manage more than one directory!</div>

	Works perfectly! I use it to backup files from my Uni-Server... Keeps me up to date every week with one click. =)</div>

	This is a really well done piece of software. The GUI is intuitive. It is fast. The file transfers are fast. I am really impressed with this tool.</div>

	Really solid utility. Fantastic features, easy to use, fast and reliable. From a former user of SyncToy.</div>

	OMG!! This is the GREATEST file synchronization tool I've used. I'm an Ubuntu user/admin for 3 years now and after testing FreeFileSync, I'll stick to it. I think FreeFileSync deserves to be in Canonical's repositories.</div>

	Great app and very useful tool. Bug-free. Intuitive. Has everything you can imagine for file synchronization. Copy. Backup. Compare...</div>
