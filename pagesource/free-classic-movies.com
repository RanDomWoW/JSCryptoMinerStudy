Her personal story is rare, and, some might think, very boring. She  began acting in 1939, after appearing on the cover of many glamour magazines.  Her beauty was equaled by few, and her acting talent was almost as great. However,  I can find no torrid love affairs with single or married men. I can find no  battles with alcohol or drugs, and no red-hot temper tantrums.<br><br>Maris Wrixon began acting in 1939, and in 1940 she married a  motion picture film editor. After appearing in movies and television shows for  a bit over twenty years, she retired from acting, happy to be the wife of a  film editor, and mother of four. After 59 years of marriage, her husband Rudi  died on the sixteenth of April, 1999, and exactly 6 months later, on the  sixteenth of October, Maris passed.<br><br>In this story, her most famous motion picture appearance, she  is a crippled girl in a small town where a strange doctor is trying to cure her  and help her to walk again. The doctor is played by motion picture horror icon  Boris Karloff, and he will stop at nothing to create the special serum that can  make the young lady walk again. Pop a big bowl of white kernel popcorn with  plenty of warm melted butter drizzled over it and enjoy the show.</p><p>Have a slow streaming connection or don't have time to watch this movie right now?

<hr><p>The question that I am asked most often is whether these movies are <em><strong>really public domain</strong></em>, or am I sharing movies that are still copyrighted and owned by movie studios and independent producers. Some folk believe that I am clever enough to share movies still owned by studios and independent producers without them knowing, but that would not be 'clever' . . . . merely 'stupid.' The first month that I started this web site I uploaded the stack of movies that I had on hand that I believed were public domain. Within days, when only a handful of visitors found my site, a movie studio contacted me and let me know that a couple of their copyrighted movies were among my uploads. I quickly apologized and removed them, and I started learning how to research copyright office records instead of taking the word of movie bloggers.  To guarantee that I don't make a mistake, and encourage any studio or producer to correct any mistake that I might make, I do not hide the files with cryptic file names like movie pirates do, and I do not host the movies in a small offshore nation to prevent movie studios from finding either me or the movies. Every movie is named and dated and very easy for motion picture studios to search for and find . . . . . And believe me, they are constantly watching.  You may have only discovered this web site recently, but all of the movie studios watch my listings very closely, and have since the very early days. Our legal system makes it very easy for movie studio lawyers to quickly shut down an offending web site located in the U.S., and I am a very cautious person who wants to be around for a while, and have no interest in abusing the rights of others. I am also very easy to find . . . . I am a very public person with my face on every page of the web site, and a contact link on every page of the web site, and if you look at the '<a href="//jimbo-berkey.com/Meet-Jimbo.php">meet Jimbo</a>' page you can even easily discover my cell phone number. The movies that have been here for  years now are still here because they are public domain in the U.S. and/or have no current legal owner or legal guardian.<br><br>If you find an error or factual mistake, please use the <a href="//free-classic-movies.com/contact/index.php">contact page</a> to let me know so that I can correct it for everyone else. This web site attempts to celebrate the efforts of every actor from the first decades of motion pictures - not just the stars - because like a grand stew, every actor adds a unique flavor to the film, and without any of them the movie would not be the same. If you are one of these actors, or a friend or family member of an actor, please send me any anecdotes and stories that you know about any of them, and I will gladly add them to the site to enrich our knowledge about that actor or the movie they played in.</p>
