<p></p>
<h3>What makes us different?</h3>
<div class="one-half first">
<p>We do things differently at Digital.com. Unlike so many review sites, we look at what real people, like you and me, say.</p>
<p>We apply sentiment analysis to reviews about small business online tools, products and services, and we use real people approval rating to score companies. Why? Because we think this is the right way to provide you with honest and unbiased reviews.</p>
</div>
<div class="one-half">
<p>Being a small business ourselves, we know that sometimes it is difficult to decide which service to use. Especially when it comes to something you are going to spend thousands of dollars, like <a href="https://digital.com/web-hosting/">web hosting</a> or an <a href="https://digital.com/ecommerce-platforms/">ecommerce solution</a>.</p>
<p>We only review tools for running a small business website, because we know what small businesses need to grow online.</p>
</div>
<div class="one-half first">
<p> Why? Because we have been there, and we've done it ourselves! Think we've overlooked a tool or service? <a href="https://digital.com/contact/">Please let us know.</a></p>
