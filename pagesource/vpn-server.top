    <meta name="description" content="Are you interested, if monthly costs you are paying for your web hosting services are the best what you get for your price? Our company track servers of thousands of server hosting companies and create daily reports of their uptime. From a single place, you can compare server hosting plans from a small company in Europe, with hegemons in server hosting and cloud services. We monitor many of their servers and IP addresses they own, to provide you unique, and real statistics of their uptime. Note that cloud-based providers tend to have much better uptimes, but on the other side, moving a website into the cloud environment is nothing easy in terms of application changes. On the opposite, if you are having problem with the stability of your appliationÂ due to traffic spikes, dedicated solution may not help you because of limits of dedicated servers.">

Our company track servers of thousands of server hosting companies and create daily reports of their uptime. From a single place, you can compare server hosting plans from a small company in Europe, with hegemons in server hosting and cloud services. We monitor many of their servers and IP addresses they own, to provide you unique, and real statistics of their uptime. Note that cloud-based providers tend to have much better uptimes, but on the other side, moving a website into the cloud environment is nothing easy in terms of application changes. On the opposite, if you are having problem with the stability of your appliationÂ due to traffic spikes, dedicated solution may not help you because of limits of dedicated servers.</span><div id="anreg"><a id="reg" name="reg"></a>

<a name="text"></a><h1>Minecraft pe servers</h1>

<p>What is the most critical part, when you decide to run your own server for gaming, for example Minecraft? Letâs take it from pure computing power point of view. If we calculate that a special service might need to run for thousands of users simultaneously, probably the most expensive part are TCP connections. So, probably total available memory will be the most critical part, since every connection allocates some (even small) memory resources. After your server start to be without available memory, like due to traffic spikes, your computer start to swap âÂ which is a situation, when computer is without any fast memory (RAM), and start to move less used connections to hard drive âÂ usually known as a situation, when a computer start to hang, since hard drives are multiple times slower than a typical memory. Here we come to the second part of server optimization â using SSD drives. Even though SSD drives are not as fast as classic RAM, they might come in hand, when swapping start to be a real problem. SSD drives have (thanks using PCI express bus) high throughtput, so their fast access times can save your server from complete outage.Â </p>

                  <h2>USA Vpn</h2><p>This article is not exactly about VPN in USA. But it covers the need of changing the âlocationâ when you are using the Internet. Mostly for blocked access from your country or company.</p>  <p>Recently I found very simple way to achieve this. You do not need specialised VPN software or paid access. All you need for start is specialised web browser. First you need to download the browser: It is called: Epic Privacy Browser</p>  <p>This browser allows you to surf through proxy. It has some preinstalled proxies from whole word. So you can choose which country you want to surf from. It is not exactly VPN, but for many users is this all they need. 1 click and you surf from USA, 2. click and you surf from Englandâ¦ And as a bonus, there is a plenty options to make you as anonymous, as possible. Browser is based on Chromium, but it lacks the ability to connect with google account. It may look like downfall, but for security reasons it is good choice. Maybe it will not be your default browser, but sometimes it could be useful.</p><div style="text-align:right;"><a href="/menu/3722/">Link</a>

                  <h1>Comparison of free image hosting</h1>  <p>Most of us sometimes figure out where to upload a picture you need to quickly show your friend and do not want to upload it to Facebook or other social networks. Or you want to upload some holiday photos in 1 pack. Or a screenshot of the game. Is it faster to upload it via FTP to your web space? Or somewhere else? Fortunately there are services that specialize in it.</p>  <p>There are dozens of similar services, so definitely do not expect all in the article. However, if any of you have an interesting tip, write to the comments - I like to add it to the article.</p>  <p>And how does this service actually work? Basically, it&#39;s easy - select the image on your computer in the form and upload (upload button) it to the server. Server processes it (often renames it) and spits out the image page whose link you can send to your friends. Some services (and most of them) offer other options - such as HTML code for embedding on the web, or BBCode for forum placement.</p>  <h2>Image Hosting</h2>  <p>Image Hosting is probably one of the first services of this type that you will encounter. At first glance, it is clear that traffic is getting from the ad, which is a bit overwhelming on the upload form. The upload itself is fast, and the page with the different codes is already displayed.</p>  <p>Rating: 2/5</p>  <h2>TinyPic</h2>  <p>TinyPic is one of the most popular image hosting companies. And that is quite deserved. It bets on a nice simple design, but with advertising again. Recording is also fast and we have different codes again. In addition, you can send a link to someone on an email.</p>  <p>Rating: 4/5</p>  <h2>Free Image Hosting</h2>  <p>To change something pink. But why not? Freeimagehosting.net is also a quite used service. They&#39;re especially proud to be able to upload larger images and less disturbing ads. In addition, it automatically converts BMP to JPEG, due to its size reduction.</p>  <p>Rating: 3/5</p>  <h2>The ImageHosting</h2>  <p>ImageHosting.cz is a free image hosting service without annoying advertising. Max file size is 15 MB. You can even set how to resize the image with conserving the proportion of the image.</p>  <p>Rating: 4/5</p>  <h2>ImageVenue</h2>  <p>ImageVenue is not too familiar with us, which is a pity. It offers many interesting options - such as multiple image uploads, reducing them to the required size, and also reducing the image to screen size while viewing and enlarging it to its original size by clicking.</p>  <p>Rating: 4/5</p>  <h2>ImageShack</h2>  <p>ImageShack is clearly the most famous and most widely used service of this type. However, it does not stand out much compared to others.</p>  <p>Rating: 3/5</p>  <h2>Image Upload</h2>  <p>There is second Czech representative here. So I chose Image Upload from the ArtySite Group. He definitely is not lagging behind his foreign "colleagues".</p>  <p>Rating: 4/5</p>  <h2>Conclusion</h2>  <p>The purpose of this article was to introduce interesting services and also to convince others that ImageShack is not the only one and the best. Perhaps I saved someone from working with the search for image hosting.</p><div style="text-align:right;"><a href="/menu/3733/">Link</a>

The list shows who to play with and how many hours the transmission starts. In the details of the match there are links available to launch a live stream. The server is not a broadcaster, but only provides links to live streams. Most of them are done without license agreement, so they are not guaranteed. This means that watching such matches is not a matter of rules, and so often transmission is lost, the web is virtually âpaintedâ with ads, and some of them can pose a potential risk to the computer for the computer. Therefore, do not install anything from the site in any way. And, of course, you enter it at your own risk.</p><div style="text-align:right;"><a href="/menu/3771/">Link</a>

                  <h1>Social networks and communication programs or free chat rooms on which we grew up</h1>  <p>Our generation has already got in touch with several social networks when we were youth, and although we still preferred to go outdoors rather than spend computer hours, some of us literally fall in their spell. What have we used, what are we still using today and which websites are just surviving? Come with us to remember the legendary sites and programs or the first attempts at field of social networks.</p>  <p>And at the beginning, I ask you a question: how old were you, when you have entered the Internet for the first time? Although we recently celebrated 25 years of Internet in the Czech Republic, it was not as wide spread as it used to be in all households today. If your first contact with the Internet took place in the new millennium, you probably did not know what a powerful tool it will grow from it. Perhaps every young user started playing online games (firstly most primitive one), and only later found that internet communication was not such a bore. So let&#39;s move to the beginning of the new millennium and see what was going on.</p>  <h2>Web, with which most young users started in the Czech Republic</h2>  <p>At the beginning of the new millennium, the AlÃ­k.cz server, a social network for children, was run on the popularity wave - this time it was a service that offered children not only communication with their friends but also filling their free time. You could read various fairy tales, jokes, play games, or have counseling advice.</p>  <p>Alik.cz is primarily targeted at younger schoolchildren who are just beginning to be familiar with the internet. Alik&#39;s creators have been and are aware of this, and thus teach their users internet safety not only on Alik.cz but on the Internet in general. When migrating to "more mature" networks, the kids are more careful because they know little about Internet security.</p>  <p>Nowadays AlÃ­k.cz still exists and offers the same services as it did at that time. It is visited by about 100,000 users a month, who are mostly in the 8-14 age group.</p>  <h2>O ou, or will you be at ICQ tonight?</h2>  <p>Although Alik.cz can be not recognized or used by you, ICQ ("I Seek You") and its distinctive announcement of the incoming message (O ou) were sure. This simple communicator was at the top in the first decade of the new millennium. ICQ was developed much earlier, in 1996. The first version was developed by Israeli Mirabilis, but most users have this communication client associated with AOL, which bought it from Mirabilis in 1998. It was just the ICQ that became the leader on the market for instant messaging services. The service was built on the OSCAR (Open System for CommunicAtion in Realtime) protocol developed by AOL. It also used this protocol in its second communicator - AIM. Some unofficial clients used the "Talk To OSCAR" protocol, but their support was terminated in 2005.</p>  <p>AOL finally sell entire service to the Russian company Digital Sky Technologies, which still keeps it alive and supplies it with new features. Via ICQ, you can call or make a video call. Redemption by a Russian company makes sense - ICQ is still popular in Russia and some post-Soviet countries, while the Western world preferred networks such as Facebook, Skype and WhatsApp. The question remains when even in these countries ICQ will lose its "magic" quite the same as it did in our country.</p>  <p>In addition to communication, various games have been played through ICQ, including Zoopaloola, Rock Paper Scissors or WarSheep.</p>  <h2>Czech social and community networks and free chat rooms that we all knew ...</h2>  <p>Large portals, such as the Seznam or the Centrum, have operated, in addition to e-mail boxes, other communication services that have long been popular, but now some of them belong to someone else.</p>  <p>Let&#39;s start with the Seznam - it runs two services that make it possible to connect with other people. Within the class you could write through SpoluÅ¾Ã¡ci.cz and if you wanted a more open chat, you could write via LidÃ©.cz. The lack of interest in these services started with the arrival of foreign social networks, such as Facebook. They were aware of the Seznam and therefore they have taken on their service LidÃ©.cz rather like a dating site that holds their position on the market. In the case of Spoluzaci, however, no change or innovation has taken place, and it is hard to assume that there is an increasing number of new classes and users in this service. Design is still the same for several years, and the service is rather perceived as an archive of memories for those who have used the service in the past - but the hand on the heart, who has ever opened the Swallows? Most of us in the last grade at elementary school ...</p>  <h2>One of the first versions of XChat.</h2>  <p>Popular chatting services and tools were also popular, characterized by standing or private chat rooms that were specific to any area, either interest or geography. One of these was XChat.cz, which was taken over by Centrum.cz to a group of students from the Technical University of Liberec. He gained his placement not only because he offered an alternative to the then LidÃ©.cz, but also because his use on mobile phones enabled one of the three operators in Czech Republic absolutely free of charge. The concept of public chat was great for getting to know new acquaintances that became reality from the virtual world. Each free chat room had its own story and the people who were in it. If such services are still interested, it is difficult to say. On Saturday afternoon, there are about 1,600 users on XChat active. True, it&#39;s not a very small number, but there were many more - especially at times when users were overtaking who would have been hunted for as long as possible. The service has also changed its owner - at present, the service is taken care of by enthusiasts who have bought not only XChat from Centrum Holdings but also associated Fotoalba.cz.</p>  <p>Â </p>  <p>On the way to acquaintance went to the web site LÃ­bÃ­mseti.cz, which also continues its way to this day. It was based on the idea of an internet dating site, but it also offers various forums, free chat rooms, blogs, or horoscopes. According to Wikipedia, libimseti.cz has the biggest increase in 2008, when the service could have 270,000 unique users. Since then, the popularity of this service has declined. In 2010, the owner and seller sold it. In addition to LÃ­bÃ­mseti.cz, XTeen was also used for acquaintance, but he did not live for financial reasons today.</p>  <p>Â </p>  <p>Just as we now recall the services we used a few years ago, we might be remembered for several years on Facebook or Twitter. Perhaps now it sounds unrealistic, but deliberately - you&#39;ve ever said it&#39;s impossible for Xchat or LÃ­bÃ­mseti.cz to have a rapid drop in users ...</p><div style="text-align:right;"><a href="/menu/3788/">Link</a>

However, you probably did not look for it, did you?</p>  <p>One of the possible portals for Aesop login is a service providing records of absences and time management for teachers and students. Phrases searched primarily by teachers and students. Interestingly, this is the original name of the service, which now appears under the name: Frontline Education. You can find the login page here: https://signin.frontlineeducation.com<.....  <p>Other interesting search results are based, for example, on the brand of cosmetics: https://www.aesop.com, however, we do not think that if you are looking for "aesop login", you are looking for access to the beauty website.</p>  <p>Numbers from our popular Keyword Analysis Tool: Semrush speaks about 301,000 search terms per year in the US. This suggests that an adequate number of users would rather have the original name Aesop than the new Frontline Education.

                  <h1>Firefox has a plan: Old extensions will stop working in 2018</h1>  <p>Mozilla has released this year a Firefox transition plan from XUL-based extensions to WebExtensions i.e. APIs that use Opera, Chrome, or Edge browsers. The first changes came in the spring.<br /> Firefox has long been preparing for major changes to the expansion system. In 2016, Mozilla required to sign Mozilla&#39;s installed expansion, this year&#39;s working on full cancellation of support for old XUL extension. For many months, we already know that the interface should be turned off in the future in favor of the Universal WebExtensions API. This can be found today in Opera, Chrome or Edge browsers.</p>  <p>We were originally scheduled to arrive in 2017, but only this year has Mozilla published a specific plan. The changes will take place over the next twelve months. The first will not be notice by common user, for the first half of the year the news will only concern developers.<br /> In version 51, Electrolysis achitecture was enabled for users with extensions that do not declare compatibility with multiprocessing architecture. This is at least for the time being, but it all depends on how beta extensions are tested.<br /> Firefox version 52, the latest version of Windows XP and Vista. At the same time, the ESR will be released with long support so that users of older Microsoft systems or those without the desire to change the expansion will be able to postpone the update for another year.<br /> The first major change will be released with the release of Firefox 53. From this version, it will no longer be possible to add XUL-based news to the official expansion database. However, it will still be possible to update and deliver already-known extensions to users.<br /> A full transition to WebExtensions will take place in Firefox 57, which will be released in 2018. It will no longer accept other extensions, and XUL will end up in the extensions. In addition, it will be necessary to use only a new version of the extension. At that time, the API should be complete and compatibility should be high.<br /> Mozilla wants to unify its extension interface with other browsers. As a result, the development should be simpler when the developer will not have to dive into the internal structures of Firefox so he can program it. On the contrary, in the future, it will be a matter of transferring existing extensions from other browsers in the future.<br /> However, Mozilla admits that some extensions will no longer be possible with the new API. Especially in those cases where extension extends much to the browser. These extensions will either change functionality or they will have to disappear. Discontented users can use the Firefox fork called Palemoon, which split off Firefox in 2009 and continues to develop a classical fully configurable interface and will continue to support XUL. Probably, however, in the next few months, the number of extension developers who will pay attention to it will fall dramatically.</p><div style="text-align:right;"><a href="/menu/3867/">Link</a>

                  <h1>Linux is on 498 of the 500 most powerful computers in the world</h1>  <p>Only two supercomputers from 500 of the world&#39;s most powerful systems did not use Linux back in 2016. The new release of the TOP500 list has shown that Linux in this industry has overwhelmed all competitors.<br /> The list of the top 500 supercomputers in the world shows that the giants are still in the industry in the US and China. Each of the countries has 171 representatives, and together they have two thirds of all seats. The fact that the ranking is a lot of change, it shows the fact that a year ago, the United States had a list of 200 computers and China only 108.<br /> Most powerful leadership is now firmly held by China, with two top executives: Sunway TaihuLight with 93 PFLOPS and Tianhe-2 with 34 PFLOPS. But if we add the power of all machines together, the positions of the two superpowers are balanced: the US has 33.9% power and China 33.3%. Other major countries with supercomputing capacity are: Germany with 31 entries, Japan with 27, France with 20 and Britain with 13.</p>  <p>Systems with a power greater than 1 PFLOPS occupy the first 117 bars. It was only 81 in 2015. To get the supercomputer to the ranking, he would have to cross the 349.3 TFLOPS. In 2015 it was 206.3 TFLOPS. In terms of efficiency, the computer is equipped with the new NVIDIA P100 chips, which delivers power of 9.46 GFLOPS per watt.<br /> Intel continues to be the largest supplier of processors, whose chips are powered by 462 supercomputers. Behind it is IBM with Power Chips, which can be found in 22 systems. AMD is still at retreat and we can only find it on 7 supercomputers, while in 2015 it was on 13.<br /> The individual nodes of the supercomputers are most often connected to the Gigabit ethernet, which is found on 206 partitions. In the second place, InfiniBand technology has 187 slots, and the decimal data is transmitted in 178 cases. The rise of Intel Omni-Path, which was only 8 computers 2016, was 28 in 2016.<br /> The largest suppliers are Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) with 140 computers, but including 28 machines from SGI. The second place is Lenovo with 92 systems. This is followed by Cray with 56 - but he dominates the ranking as he holds 21.3%. In fifth place is IBM with 33 supercomputers.<br /> Almost all of these supercomputers run Linux, specifically in 498 out of 500 systems. The only two remaining machines are Chinese and are 386th and 387th. They run on IBM AIX and as the chart changes, they are gradually falling down. It is likely, therefore, that in one of the next releases, Linux will have a 100% share - perhaps this will happen in new chart in 2017.<br /> The ranking first appeared in 1993 and at that time Linux was only at the very beginning of its journey. Linux first appeared in the TOP500 ranking in 1998, at the time he was clearly ruling on Unix supercomputers. In 2003, you would find it at 96% of installations. But in virtually two years, it has replaced Linux, which has dominated and today we find it on the vast majority of supercomputers in the world. Since 2010, more than 90% of them have been driven continuously on Linux.</p><div style="text-align:right;"><a href="/menu/3868/">Link</a>

                  <h1>To control 500k cameras is not science, just guess the default passwords</h1>  <p>Linux malware Mirai has over half a million devices connected to the Internet and attacks them on different targets. It is remarkable that it works completely trivially: it simply guesses passwords.</p>  <p>The cameras are attacking. We already know this, it is written by world media because it is a really serious problem. It can generate a stream of over one Tbps, send over one million HTTP requests every second, and place a large DNS service provider and also a large part of the important Internet services. We know this, many have warned them and they finally came.</p>  <p>Surprisingly, how simple it was. It uses a malware called Mirai that focuses on various "smart" devices typically using BusyBox. It searches them over the Internet, tries to attack them, install them in, and then it can commit a variety of attacks. But the crucial thing is that Mirai does not abuse any sophisticated software bug, does not need any "Dirty Cow" or Heartbleed.</p>  <p>Mirai simply guesses default passwords. Since the source code has been released, we know today exactly what passwords are and especially that there are only 60. Sixty! So small and still enough to attack half a million devices around the world.</p>  <p>It is probably a whole range of devices from the mentioned cameras, through routers (ubnt password) to baby nurseries or network drives. However, most of the devices belong to a common category, as people from the Flashpoint point out - credential are also well known for these devices. It turned out to be especially the products of Dahua Technology, which specializes in the production of IP cameras.</p>  <p>However, a number of devices of very diverse manufacturers have been discovered, which at first sight have nothing in common at all. However, it turned out that these manufacturers use hardware and software from XiongMai Technologies, a Chinese company that supplies complete technology for building similar devices - from cameras to video recorders or recording cameras.</p>  <p>The manufacturer then completes his "own" product, fumigates with the supplied firmware and give it immediately to the store. However, XiongMai delivers leaky software that opens the integrated computer to the world and allows its mass infecting. There are talks about half a million attacked devices.</p>  <p>The problem would not be so great if the device was not easily accessible from the Internet. However, the supplied firmware leaves an open telnet interface through which the devices can be controlled remotely. Telnet? Did you think he was dead a long time ago? Big mistake, the embedded device area is unfortunately too widespread.</p>  <p>To make it even worse: telnet is turned on by default, it cannot be turned off and can be logged in with a default password that cannot be changed! This is a paradise for all botnet operators.</p>  <p>This is not all yet, people from Flashpoint have discovered a firmware way to get around signing up completely: instead of login.htm, you just have to get DVR.htm. In addition, Shodan&#39;s scanning service shows that devices suffering from these errors are over half a million in the world. And that&#39;s just one particular dilettante manufacturer with bad firmware. Estimates talk about millions of similarly leaking devices connected to the Internet.</p>  <p>Among the countries with the most vulnerable devices are Vietnam (80,000), Brazil (62,000), Turkey (40,000), Taiwan (29,000), China (22,000), South Korea (21,000) , India (15,000) and United Kingdom (14,000).</p>  <p>Flashpoint notes that most of the Dahua devices are, but XiongMai&#39;s XiongMai firmware is also a big part of it. It also depends on specific countries and the representation of individual products. Dahua may need 65 percent of the attack in the United States, but XiongMai is responsible for almost 70 percent of infected devices in countries like Turkey or Vietnam, where most of the attacking operations come.</p>  <p>Using default passwords is like having no passwords. Users should therefore be more careful about configuring similar devices that will be turned on once and not usually covered. However, the butter on the head is mainly made by producers who are still making the same mistakes that have been pointed out many years ago. But it&#39;s futile.</p>  <p>The best solution is to have no default passwords at all. Ideally, the device should ask for a password at the first start of the user and do not let it go further without this action. Obviously, we would not solve all the problems of the world, but at least nobody could catch us with the trousers down running.</p><div style="text-align:right;"><a href="/menu/3869/">Link</a>

                  <h1>Telnet still lives - at least on "smart" devices</h1>  <p>You may have already met Telnet and used it to logging on remote computers. Whatever your experience with Telnet is, you probably would not think of it for anything new.</p>  <p>Telnet has been replaced by SSH and SSH become de facto the standard for remote connectivity because it provides significantly higher security, encryption and many other benefits.</p>  <p>When we created our first honeypots for the some project, we started SSH and Telnet because both protocols offer interactive access to the console and are therefore very interesting for potential attackers. But SSH was, of course, our main goal - Telnet was a complementary function.</p>  <p>What was our surprise, however, when we found that honeypot traffic for Telnet is three times higher than SSH. Even though we compare some pears and apples, because in the case of Telnet we count the number of login attempts, and the number of commands given in SSH, the difference is equally enormous and is also apparent in other parameters, such as the number of unique IP addresses of the attackers.</p>  <p>Because our honeypots are being monitored for any exciting new activity, of course we were wondering what the reason for this phenomenon might be. Is it an increased activity of known attackers, or did new attackers appear? If this is the second option, where do the attackers take? The traffic spike began at the end of May 2016, but it is not such a significant change to explain the observed increase in traffic. It is clear, therefore, that new invaders had to appear.</p>  <p>The number of attackers jumped from about 30,000 unique IP addresses per day to more than 100,000, and despite a certain drop, they still keep values at least twice the previous values.</p>  <p>This meant something had to happen - either an entity (probably a botnet) previously inactive in Telnet scanning was activated, or an already existing botnet quickly picked up new members. In order to get a better idea of what has happened, we have done a more detailed analysis of the situation.</p>  <h2>Geography</h2>  <p>We first looked at the geographical origin of the attacks and how they changed over time. Obviously, with the exception of China, which was active earlier, most countries increased their activity at the same time.</p>  <p>Now we know where most of the attacks come from, but we are still not much closer to finding out what is actually attacking us.</p>  <h2>Device</h2>  <p>In order to find out something else, we no longer just need to know the IP address of the attacker. In order to find out what&#39;s behind the given IP address, we could either actively scan it or use a third-party service. In this case, we chose the other option and used Shodan.io to get more information about the given IP address. From the data we obtained, we focused especially on the information that can be used to identify the type of product behind the given IP address. For this purpose, a particularly interesting item "Server:" from the HTTP header or similar services has appeared. We have obtained this value for more than 1.8 million IP addresses out of a total of approximately 6.5 million IP addresses, ie slightly over 27%.</p>  <p>Here, it should be noted that the specific value of the header does not determine a specific product, but rather a family of similar devices with the same or similar software. It is also possible that more than one of these services is running on one device.</p>  <p>First, we find the RomPager / 4.07 HTTP server, an old version of the HTTP server used in many home routers and other embedded devices that have been experiencing serious security flaws in the past. Secondly, gSOAP / 2.7, which is also an older version of the popular Web services toolkit, often used in embedded devices. H264DVR 1.0 is the identifier for the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) server used in networked DVRs such as security cameras, etc. It is clear from the names of other products that they are often embedded devices such as Dahua Rtsp Server, which again refers to CCTV cameras. Specifically, this product also had security issues in history.</p>  <p>It is clear from the above that at least among the devices that have been identified is a large number of built-in devices such as cameras, routers, and so on. These devices often have outdated software that has known security holes and the attacker can easily compromise a large number of devices with a single exploit. What we have not looked at yet is the question of whether these devices may be behind the recent increase in Telnet attacks.</p>  <p>We see the activity of the most frequently observed products, namely RomPager / 4.07 and gSOAP / 2.7. Both have seen a near-order increase in activity since May 2016. Even more interesting is the situation with H264DVR 1.0. In this case, we did not see much activity until April 2016, when suddenly 7,000 unique IP addresses appeared with this server, and after about one month they scanned the Telnet service. Then, the activity paused for a while to return in even stronger form, with the number of attacking devices rising to 20,000 unique IP addresses per day.</p>  <p>From the above, we can conclude that Telnet&#39;s increased attack activity was largely due to embedded devices. We can speculate that the attacker or attackers were able to deliberately attack these devices due to a known bug, and after their control, the botnet is trying to expand even further. What is even worse than the current number of infected devices is a trend.</p>  <p>At present, there are approximately 20,000 new attacking devices each day. Their composition is very similar to the overall picture we have seen above. Many of the newly recorded attackers are therefore built-in devices.</p>  <p>In fact, the situation for some of these products is such that the number of attacking devices is, for some types, a significant part of the total number of these devices visible on the Internet. The following chart is a copy of the chart above but also contains a comparison between the number of such devices recorded in our honeypot and the total number of such devices available on the Internet as recorded by Shondan.io. The most important is the H264DVR 1.0 server, where more than two-thirds of devices with this service are "infected".</p>  <h2>Conclusion</h2>  <p>In 2016, we saw a significant increase in Telnet honeypots. From available data, we came to the conclusion that many attempts to attack come from built-in devices such as CCTV cameras, routers, and so on. These devices are often easy prey because they often form a "monoculture" where many devices have the same equipment and vulnerabilities. It is very likely that an attacker specifically targets some of these devices to create a botnet. Even in some cases, it appears that a significant proportion of equipment of a particular type is already being attacked.</p>  <p>During our investigation, we managed to get one "infected" CCTV camera. In its firmware, we were unable to find any obvious traces of malware, which leads us to the preliminary conclusion that the attacks are carried out remotely without permanent changes to the firmware of the device. However, these results are preliminary and we will continue to investigate this case more deeply.</p>  <p>I suggest you think about which of your "smart" devices you can access from the Internet and consider whether you cannot restrict access to the firewall. No system is perfect and equipment with outdated software without regular patches is a security risk. It is very likely that what we observe with Telnet is just the tip of the glacier of what all the dangerous is happening on the Internet.</p><div style="text-align:right;"><a href="/menu/3870/">Link</a>

                  <h1>Are You Ready For The Dangerous IT World?</h1>  <p>The digital era has brought simplification and simplification of work at the same time. We have everything available online for a couple of clicks in a matter of seconds - but we can just as soon as it comes to being attacked.</p>  <p>Today, businesses have to take steps to transform into a digital environment that brings new security threats. At the same time, they must adapt to the changing demands and working habits of the new generation of employees. This represents unprecedented challenges in terms of security.</p>  <p>IT vendors and businesses deal with different areas of security mostly in part, which can bring unexpected problems again. It is therefore better to look at this topic in a comprehensive way - as they do so full service IT houses. So how do we do it?</p>  <p>Our goal is to be able to deliver hardware, connect systems, design the most effective software solutions, cloud technologies, or mobile applications; our customer can also use our services in back-up through data centres to outsourcing services. It does not have to deal with what and how - the result is essential. Simply said: to be able to sit (and not have to be in the office but quietly with a tablet at a coffee table), and without any obstacles, just do his job. An increasingly important part of this comprehensive approach is also - to do it safely.</p>  <h2>We&#39;ll do everything</h2>  <p>The higher the security requirements are, the more prominent we are dealing with. There are many solutions to the account that have addressed security automatically as an integral part of our deliveries and project implementation. At the same time, we keep track of the world&#39;s trends and bring news that drives this area forward. We also deal with security in terms of legislation. This is also very important, and it finally begins to be a topic of discussion in every IT firm.</p>  <h2>So what does the security area mean today?</h2>  <p>All possible and important - from secure infrastructure and networks, through BYOD solutions, mobile technologies, applications and sensitive data, access and identity management to security intelligence. In the long run, we are working with new IT trends and transferring them to specific solutions that work under specific conditions. Also in the current security issue, we have not only an overview but also positive customer references.</p>  <p>It has been helped to make sure that we do not deal with each of these areas separately, but we are all connecting together to: provide the customer with a high level of overall security. Whether it&#39;s internal processes, data protection or, for example, buildings. We know there, for example implement effective server monitoring tools. According to the data, the life of the building is being monitored, how it should "work", and it is possible to respond immediately to an unusual situation. We also help with cities and communities. We can customize services if they need to control and (not) allow access, transit of traffic within their self-government, and so on.</p>  <h2>In the network with no worries</h2>  <p>Network security is a foundation for customers, without which today it really is not. However, there are new challenges that, according to our experience, still have not been sufficiently addressed by many companies. Extensive network infrastructures have many times been concentrated in multiple locations, and operate in intensive and diverse communication. In doing so, it must be ensured that they remain reliable, efficient and safe.</p>  <p>With our company solutions, we&#39;ll get an overview of network data streams and the ability to monitor what we consider to be a prerequisite for diagnostics and accurate allocation of network and application performance issues.</p>  <p>They can stop both internal and external attacks and eliminate advanced cyber threats. I can detect network anomalies in real-time, and of course - knowledge of the network at anytime and anywhere in the network (for example, for detailed user and service tracking). It is very useful in banks, industrial enterprises, but also in government organizations.</p>  <p>A little behind the scenes: we can deliver such a solution both as a service and as a hardware solution. Provides IP-based data network monitoring from 10 Mbps to 100 Gbps throughput, and used for network monitoring, security, troubleshooting, billing and billing, line capacity planning, user and application monitoring, legally-tuned, NPM performance monitoring ) and others. The Network Behavior Analysis (NBA) plug-in allows for automatic detection of operational and security incidents that cannot be identified by standard security tools currently in use, firewalls and antiviruses.</p>  <h2>BYOD or not?</h2>  <p>Cloud, Mobility and BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) are a growing trend in the current IT world. According to our surveys, up to 71% of companies will have an active BYOD policy within 2 years, and by 2017, as many as half of employees will require the use of their own devices in their work. Especially recently, we are witnessing a dynamically growing number of mobile devices, including private ones, used to access corporate data. This, of course, also increases the pressure on information security.</p>  <p>From the point of view of the employer and the people responsible for internal security, concerns also grow. However, these companies will have to stop, given the advantages that the BYOD trend brings into practice - and which are beginning to manifest in Slovak conditions as well. Practice e.g. confirms that productivity, productivity, flexibility and availability are increasing. Employees, in turn, positively appreciate greater comfort as they work on such a PC, operating system, and with such programs and applications as they do. This is particularly attractive for the younger generation of employees.</p>  <p>The number of security attacks is increasing, becoming increasingly diverse, and the invaders more sophisticated and patient. In response to justified concerns, the implementation of an intelligent system that can predict such attacks can be detected in time and also trigger a process to remediate the incident.</p><div style="text-align:right;"><a href="/menu/3903/">Link</a>

                  <h1>Ten-ton tablet</h1>  <p>At a time when computer CRT monitors were hot news, and operating memory was measured on tens of kilobytes, MIT developed a first computer capable of recording a pen drawing on the monitor.</p>  <p>If you were doing a dissertation work in electrical engineering and computer science at the beginning of the sixties, who would you like to have as a trainer and opponent? What about Claude Shannon, perhaps Marvin Minsky (creator of the first HMD and computer AI legend) and Steven Coons? It was this trio that supervised the young student Ivan Sutherland, who completed his doctoral work on computer graphics at MIT. The result was the first graphics tablet, the first interactive graphics artwork and manipulation program, and the first graphical user interface precursor. As if only one of these was not enough to make a man at the age of twenty-five become a legend of computer history.</p>  <h2>How a gardener became programmer</h2>  <p>Building drawings, drawing board, ink and pen - that was the environment in which during the 1940s little Ivan, the son of a construction engineer who moved with his family from the American Midwest to the East Coast. The fact that Ivan Sutherland did not grow up in his native Nebraska had an even more important consequence: as a schoolboy he met Edmund Berkeley, the author of the first book on computers for the general public (Great Brains or Machines That Think, 1949) and the first "computer building kit" - Simon - equipped with 12-bit relay memory, which was sold for $ 600 at the beginning of the 1950s.</p>  <p>However, that the brothers did not know Sutherland. They were looking for a way to make some money, and Berkeley needed help with chopping the lawn and general garden maintenance. After a short time, they became friends and he began to teach them the basics of programming just on the little Simon. In particular, the elder Ivan was really excited for programming, and after a while he wrote a four-page splitting program for Simon. Ivan Sutherland has probably become perhaps the first high school graduate in the world - and it is no surprise that when he entered college he entered electrically engineered college instead of the originally planned civil engineering. After completing his bachelor&#39;s degree at Carnegie Mellon University, he first headed to Caltech, where he completed his master&#39;s studies and then went on as a doctoral student at MIT - here, as we have already indicated, he began writing the history of Sketchpad.</p>  <h2>TX-2: the only one of its kind, for graphics as it is made</h2>  <p>Ivan Sutherland, in the introduction to his doctoral thesis, highlights the important role played by the TX-2 computer originally designed for artificial intelligence research. In particular, itâs large magnetic core memory with a capacity of approximately 256 kilobytes (70,000 words with a 36-bit width), a large number of indexed registers, flexible input and output control, and a range of manual switches, rotary relays and control buttons. Because it was an experimental research computer, it was possible to complete custom-made elements or peripherals (such as a control button module). Experimenting with cartooning and manipulation of shapes could move forward very quickly, and as Sutherland himself emphasized, "when we found out how to draw on a computer, the use of much smaller machines could be used for practical deployment."</p>  <p>But that does not mean Sutherland&#39;s job was easy. He had to create software to draw straight and curved lines, circles, rectangles and polygons literally from scratch - without the use of higher programming languages (not to mention libraries, etc.), solve how to work with overlapping elements, how to manipulate individual elements of shapes lubricate. All this on an "experimental" mainframe with tens of kilobytes of memory. It took him almost a year.</p>  <p>A few months later, Sutherland finished with a few colleagues third, as part of his dissertation, the final version of Sketchpad, which, according to his own words, could work even unskilled people including the secretary. A library of basic shapes and elements has been created to serve to create more complex drawings faster. It was clear to Sutherland that he had created a software and software with the potential "beyond the dreams".</p>  <h2>Revolution in the laboratory only</h2>  <p>Looking at the TX-2, it is clear that the concept of "first tablet" is somewhat exaggerated. Still, in the graphics tablet, a multi-ton colt with a CRT screen and Sketchpad software was. But the sketchpad was not just the software - it was a solution involving interactive real-time computer interaction (long before a similar concept became common), interactive "graphical" user interface (quotes are mainly because there was no abstraction in the "only" option to directly manipulate shapes as objects - to draw, scroll, rotate, shrink or enlarge, copy, and delete). But it was the biggest revolution - the transformation of a computer screen into a drawing board or a sketch capable of replicating innumerable images or shapes over and over again. Sketchpad was even able to work with three-dimensional objects and was so "user-tuned" that random shuffle movements (usually the user&#39;s "hand" with the pen) ignored and did not transfer them to the recorded shapes.</p>  <p>Sutherland&#39;s Sketchpad, unfortunately, was one of the revolutionary achievements that overtook his time. The era of interactive computer work and graphical interfaces should come in over ten years, and the software created for the TX-2 unique research computer could not simply be transferred to other platforms. In addition, computer graphics research over the next decade has focused on other areas - particularly surface rendering techniques (shading, textures, pixels). Well, finally, Sutherland himself reorientated himself to a completely new field immediately after obtaining a doctorate - a virtual reality research</p><div style="text-align:right;"><a href="/menu/3989/">Link</a>

                  <h1>John von Neumann</h1>  <p>He participated in the design of the first computer, the famous game theory, and the production of an atomic bomb. He is the only scientist who was considered to be smarter than Einstein.</p>  <p>John Ludwig von Neumann was born in the family of a wealthy Hungarian banker. He had been showing signs of genius since childhood. It is said that at the age of six he was able to joke with his father in ancient Greek and could divide by eight-digit numbers. From twelve years, he was privately taught by the best professor of mathematics at Budapest University. At the age of seventeen he published his first scientific work. The following year he enrolled at the Budapest University. He enrolled in a prospective field of chemical engineering. Studying was so easy for him to write his doctoral work in mathematics in his spare time. At the age of twenty-two, he goes to Berlin to begin his quantum theory and neutron network theory. He was already a respected scientist, but he became famous worldwide in 1928 as a co-founder of the mathematical theory of games, which is used to date in both economics and politics. In 1929-as a world-renowned scientist-he became Albert Einstein a founding member of the new Science Institute in Princeton.</p>  <p>When World War II began, von Neumann&#39;s attention was focused on the government and army agents. He became one of the main characters of the so-called Manhattan project, which was to develop an atomic bomb before the Germans. The team has tried to solve the problem: what amount of explosive material that grappulates with graft-size plutonium will be needed to make the most effective explosion. It was a very difficult mathematical problem on which the best scientists of the Manhattan project had failed. Von Neumann solved it almost immediately. He created a large number of enemies among co-workers, many of whom were Nobel laureates. Even the slightest doubt disappeared about his genius disappeared on July 16, 1945, when a plutonium bomb was successfully tested in the desert of New Mexico. His plutonium bomb was thrown at Nagasaki and had twice as much destructive power as the bomb that was thrown at Hiroshima. Von Neumann then worked on another type of devastating weapon - hydrogen bombs with a destructive force thousands of times larger than the bombs in Japan. To solve this problem, he took a computer in 1950, which he was involved with. The problem was resolved, two years later, a small island in the Pacific Ocean was erased from the surface of the earth at the first test of this devastating weapon. The most dangerous stage of the Cold War has begun. Von Neumann became advisor to the US government. Von Neumann recommended that the bombs be overthrown by Russia, but President Truman, in 1950, distanced himself from this strategy. Von Neumann did not catch up with the result of the Cold War. He died in 1957 for cancer. He was less than forty-five years old.</p>  <p>In 1949 von Neumann&#39;s mathematical rules for the construction of robots, which will be perfected and reproduced, are created by reference to it. It is only today that scientists use these rules to construct such robots. NASA wants Neumann robots to use when exploring the Galaxy.</p>  <h2>Basic facts:</h2>  <ul> 	<li>1903-born in Hungary</li> 	<li>1925 - At the University of Berlin he became the youngest professor</li> 	<li>1928-co-author of the famous game theory</li> 	<li>1932-along with Einstein, he became a founding member of the Princeton Research Institute</li> 	<li>1943 - a member of the so-called Manhattan Project</li> 	<li>1944-creator of ENIAC electronic computers</li> 	<li>1957 - dies of cancer</li> </ul><div style="text-align:right;"><a href="/menu/4014/">Link</a>

                  <h1>Few tips for advanced optimization of Facebook ads</h1>  <h2>Campaign Algorithm and Budget Change during the run of the campaign</h2>  <p>â¢ Each campaign first learns and creates its algorithm. This helps it to select a specific user from a targeted audience correctly in a given budget. Only after 1-2 days the campaign runs in normal mode, using just what it has learned.</p>  <p>â¢ It is not recommended to change the budget during the run of the campaign when the campaign was taught to search for users in a predefined budget. E.g. doubling your budget will never mean a double conversion increase. The Budget Campaign just can not work because she was learning with another. A better procedure is to duplicate the campaign.</p>  <p>â¢ Like Google Adwods, the Facebook campaign collects internal ratings. A better-priced campaign can get better conditions on the ad market (better CPC, etc.). That&#39;s why it&#39;s a good idea to create a campaign for A / B test purposes, evaluate and then copy the most successful creatives and settings into a new campaign that&#39;s already gone clean.</p>  <p>â¢ If you want to convert, set the campaign from the beginning to optimization to conversion. If you do not have enough data from a Facebook optimizer to optimize your purchase (optimal 150 - 250 conversions in the last 7 days), optimize for example on AddToCart. It&#39;s better than optimizing for clicks.</p>  <p>â¢ Audiences are collected by DPA (Dynamic Product Ads) only when the campaign is launched.</p>  <h2>A/B testing</h2>  <p>â¢ I&#39;ve been recommended to test images in one AdSet at the ad level. This approach has the disadvantage (from the point of view of the account manager the advantage) that Facebook will very quickly prefere one creative before the other, and that will make A/B for me. Then I have to rely on it to make the right decision.</p>  <p>â¢ I&#39;d rather test AdSet-level creatives, which I think is better. I prefer to evaluate the results myself and I do not rely too much on Facebook.</p>  <p>â¢ According to statistics, the life of images is 7-14 days. Then the picture is sketchy and the performance goes down quickly. Of course, it depends on a particular campaign. This is not new, and everyone can find it in their stats.</p>  <p>â¢ Beware of too long a picture test. Just because of their lifetime. The indicator may have a relevance score of less than 7.</p><div style="text-align:right;"><a href="/menu/4141/">Link</a>

                  <h1>New website and visits sources</h1>  <p>You have great expectations. When a new site runs, it will be great. Business starts. Orders and jobs just simply come. Lots of new customers. Lots of money.</p>  <p>Reality? You started the web ... and nothing. A day, two, a week has passed ... and crowds nowhere. What is wrong? Waiting for your phone and email boxes ... but no one calls or writes on the web. And you really need to start earning money.</p>  <h2>Start the website = instant success? Myth!</h2>  <p>Starting the Web is just the beginning. And a lot of people do not understand or know it. They feel that if they let themselves do (good) the web, it will start an endless inflow of orders. How is it really?</p>  <ol> 	<li>We launched the site! If a new site is created, a new domain will be created, no one knows about it. And so no one will come to them. If you do not share the link or find out about the search engine. It is time to start getting traffic to work.</li> 	<li>Search Traffic? It will take a few days for the site to be indexed on search engines. This is only the case if you have sent information to the search engines on the newly created site, or they have links from other sites or social networks to the site, and the search engines will get to it themselves. This is a few days delay in getting organic attendance.</li> 	<li>Social networking? The people themselves will not come and will rarely start to spread a link to your site. Did you share information about your new Facebook pages with friends? Probably everyone looked, some laughed or commented, and the traffic for a day jumped beautifully, but few day later it is again 0.</li> 	<li>Traffic from other sites? You asked a few business partners to place links to your site on their sites. Sometimes someone clicks, but it&#39;s not much.</li> </ol>  <p>What now? You seem to have exhausted all your options, but those internets do not work the way you expected. Disappointment, frustration.</p>  <h2>Where do visitors actually come from?</h2>  <ol> 	<li>Natural visitors - people go "alone", most often through search engines - if the content of the site matches the requirements of the target group for which the site is intended. Or you have such an interesting product/service that people say about it and share a link to the web on social networks.</li> 	<li>Acquired Traffic - I&#39;m here to host visitors who you had to take some steps to bring. Sharing on social networks (creating a profile/site, engaging in discussions, etc.), creating backlinks, registering in catalogs. Additionally, they can be offline activities such as advertisements, billboards, corporate business cards, or even signatures in emails.</li> 	<li>Paid Traffic - Both of the above sources of visitors are on a longer route. If you want / need to get visitors to your site really fast, use paid advertising campaigns (Sklik, AdWords, Facebook). You pay for each visitor, but you&#39;ll get them on the web before they show up and your other activities associated with the previous two points will work. If you&#39;ve done everything right, you&#39;ll be able to dwindle paid campaigns and work from natural and unpaid paid traffic. Do not condemn your paid campaigns - they are extra costs but with immediate effect.</li> </ol>  <h2>What do you want to take and what to do to keep your traffic coming?</h2>  <p>To be active. This is in three words a summary of the next text. The number of new websites is constantly increasing and search engines are getting more and more complicated by the task of delivering the most appropriate answers to user queries. There are new sites and old sites. Valuable sites and ballast sites. Sites updated and websites neglected. Sites professionally done and sites full of errors. Sites with original content and sites with stolen or downloaded content. So search engines try to prioritize a search for trustworthy, maintained and quality sites that will be useful to people.</p>  <ul> 	<li>Look at the site in terms of content. Write new articles, add texts, expand them. Give your customers valuable insights from your industry. Work continuously to get backlinks from industry related sites. Publish articles on industry servers. Do some social networks make sense to you? Use them. You always have something to say.</li> 	<li>Check their technical condition (for example, mobile accessibility). Here too, the site requirements were completely different five years ago than they are now.</li> 	<li>Do not rely solely on online. There are many other ways out of the internet to take care of your promotion.</li> </ul>  <p>Many of these activities will not bring an immediate effect. It&#39;s a run for a longer track. However, your ongoing activity will pay off in the long run. And you get ahead of those who just launched their site and then did not reach for it. And what do you think - when the search engine "thinks" about which site it favors - whether it is neglected or active and popular that has people to say?</p>  <p>Of course, all of the above works, you need to devote enough space to reflect on the specific focus, the clear goal and sense of the site, and the definition of the audience for which you are creating.</p>  <p>And if you are doing something, you should want to know if it works and further adjust and optimize your promotional activities accordingly. We are talking about evaluation and analytics. Every activity should measure if something has been brought. From time to time, look back on whether what you are doing makes sense. Whether it&#39;s not money laundering.</p>  <h2>Summary at the end</h2>  <p>The Web is a necessity for most entrepreneurs. But it is not self-sustaining, and it would be a mistake to rely on just getting it from the beginning (beware - I&#39;m not talking about e-commerce here). It&#39;s not a miracle that automatically starts generating money at the start of the launch. It&#39;s just another promotion tool. Just like other marketing online and offline channels.</p>  <p>Do not forget about prints, personal recommendations, paid advertising campaigns, professional magazines, and more. The power is to combine everything together.</p><div style="text-align:right;"><a href="/menu/4160/">Link</a>

                  <h1>Chrome will start filtering annoying ads on websites on 2018 February 15th</h1>  <p>Google&#39;s anti-malware blocking plan has specific outlines: Chrome will block ads that do not meet Better Ads Standards starting from February 15. The filter will also hit ads from Google.</p>  <p>Google begins blocking ads on 2018 February 15. Chrome on both mobile and desktop platforms will not show ads on some sites. It is based on the poison ratings of individual ad types published by the Coalition for Better Advertising, of which Google is also a member.</p>  <h2>The ad is more aggressive and users block it completely</h2>  <p>Already in June 2017, Google announced that it is looking radically to address the worse situation on the internet advertising market. Aggressive ads make life difficult for users, and the result is an increasing number of those who block ads completely. That&#39;s why Google chose to filter an embarrassing ad in your Chrome browser that does not meet the "Better Ads Standards" standard.</p>  <p>The number of devices with blocked ads increased by 30% to the current 615 million. However, Google&#39;s survey also shows that 77% of blockers are willing to view reasonable ad formats and one of the main reasons for blocking is harassment and security.</p>  <p>Publishers are aware of this serious problem, they have founded the Coalition for Better Ads, whose members are Google, Procter & Gamble, Facebook, Thomson Reuters, The Washington Post, Interactive Advertising Bureau, Association of National Advertisers. The organization has conducted an extensive survey of 25,000 users across Europe and the US to evaluate individual types of ads and their poisoning on both the mobile and the desktop. The result is a kind of non-forbidding standard to control Google.</p>  <h2>What will be filtered?</h2>  <p>Google does not talk about its solution as a blocker but as a filter to keep publishers revenue while making life easier for users. He has been testing his solution since August 2017 Mobile Chrome, where users had to install the developer version (Canary) and manually enable the filter. However, as of 2018 February 15, the filter should be active for all users.</p>  <p>Google has now released information on what to block. The desktop will be pop-up ads, automatically playing videos with audio, prestitial ads, countdown ads, and large statically-stacked formats.</p>  <p>On mobile phones, Chrome will also block flashing and animated ads, full-screen ad formats, ads that occupy over 30% of the screen area, and large static ads. Interestingly, the browser will block all ads from sites that will have "failed" in the Ad Experience Report for more than 30 days. Google has prepared this tool for publishers who will have the opportunity to verify how their sites are. There is also information about what ad formats are a suitable alternative.</p>  <p>One failure should not harm the publisher, only a repeated attempt to display malicious ads will be punished. In order for the sites to have a chance to prepare for the new situation, the default thresholds will first be set more moderately, then tightened. Specifically, it is determined that the first two months will apply that a bad rating will get a site displaying more than 7.5% of the pages loaded with annoying advertising. Then the limit will be reduced to another four months to 5% and finally to 2.5%.</p>  <p>The site will first be warned using the Google tool mentioned above, and if it does not fix it, the ads will be blocked. But even then nothing is lost if the publisher fixes the condition, can ask for a review of the situation in the tool, and if everything goes right, the ads will start appearing again on the web.</p>  <h2>Google saves itself mainly</h2>  <p>It should be added that Google rescues mainly its own business, which stands on displaying ads. As the situation gets worse, the number of people who radically resolve the problem by installing a blocker is rising. Google hopes that at least some users will discourage this from deploying a significantly stricter ad blocking that affects both Google and publishers who are profiting from their servers and services through their ad networks.</p>  <p>Hopefully, publishers and advertisers will have to think more about the ad formats that appear on the web. Google has a great chance to crack the environment and not allow the creation of more aggressive formats and their violent groping for users. Many ad blockers claim that if they do not overfire, they are willing to get rid of the blockade. We&#39;ll see.</p>  <p>Interestingly, the date of 2018 February 15 does not match any specific Chrome version. Version 64 should be released in January 2018, and the next version should be available in March. So filter activation is probably not bound to release a new browser version.</p><div style="text-align:right;"><a href="/menu/4198/">Link</a>
