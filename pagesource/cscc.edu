											<h1>Shandon Mitchell, business and IT</h1>
											<p class="deck">Discovering new opportunities with Columbus State’s Honors Program</p>
											<p>Shandon Mitchell almost didn’t go to Columbus State. He started at a four-year college in 2014, but had to leave after a problem with scholarships. Luckily, a spot was still open in Columbus State’s Honors Program. "At first, it seemed like the end of the world, but I'm glad I ended up at Columbus State," Mitchell says. "The Honors Program has helped me in ways I couldn't have imagined."</p>
											<p>That program also led to an internship at COSI, which led to a job as a research assistant on a project to compare regional accents around Ohio. And if that wasn’t enough, Mitchell helped his brother and some friends start an apparel company while he was still a student as Columbus State. StarStrukt has a thriving online trade and maintains a storefront in Reynoldsburg. </p>
											<p>After earning his associate degree, Mitchell transferred to Ohio State’s Fisher College of business, where he’s decided to focus on business and IT for his bachelor’s degree. “I’m on track to graduate, on time, and with half the cost,” Mitchell says, noting the value of Columbus State’s low tuition.</p>

										<h1>Erica Miller, Modern Manufacturing </h1>
										<p class="deck">Columbus State’s Modern Manufacturing Work-Study program helped Miller learn on the job</p>
										<p>Erica Miller’s first foray into engineering and robotics was in middle school, when she participated in the First Lego League. “As a kid I was always fascinated with figuring out how things worked. I really liked thinking through problems and evaluating solutions,” she says. Today, she’s channeling that passion for problem-solving into her job as a technician with Stanley Electric US, Inc.</p>
										<p>Miller gained the knowledge and skills she needed through Columbus State’s Modern Manufacturing Work-Study program, which gives students an opportunity to work with a local company while they’re still in school. For Miller, that meant servicing and maintaining robots and equipment at Honda. “It’s great how what you learn at school and what you learn on the job build on each other,” she says. “They ask me to do things at work for the first time and I’m like ‘Hey, I know how to do this!’ The classes and lab work really teach you the basics so you can jump in when you get a job.”</p>
