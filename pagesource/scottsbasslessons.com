                        <p>Jazz is the perfect platform to help you expand your understanding of harmony and music theory. It will also improve your ear big time! You don’t need to aspire to become a great jazz musician to get something out of this course. It's a genre that covers so many musical elements. So if you’re a bass player outside of the jazz circle looking in, make it your goal to tackle this course and see just where it takes you.</p>

                        <p>Palm muting is essentially a picking hand technique you can use to dampen the strings on your bass. It’s a key part of becoming a skilled bass player. You can exercise more control over the sound coming out of your instrument, play more dynamically and when used in combination with other picking techniques, it adds another layer of versatility to your playing. It's a technique no bassist should be without. Let's get into it.</p>

                        <p>A looper is a great effect that allows you to record whatever you’re playing and then loop it while you play over the top. Almost all loop pedals allow you to add multiple layers to the loop, and some allow you to do even more once it’s recorded – reverse it, slow it down, speed it up, stop it, remove some or all of the layers…so where do you start? As ever, with this sort of musical problem there is more than one solution.</p>

                        <p>Chord tones are the individual notes that create a chord. They're the building blocks of harmony. Understanding the sound and function of these chord tones is super important to your success as a bass player. The better grasp you have of chord tones, the better you will understand how to connect chords and build better basslines. If you want to really understand how chords and chord progressions are built, then this course is for you.</p>

                        <p>In most performance situations, bass players aren’t given a score that includes their part note-for-note. Instead, you'll receive a chord chart or a lead sheet. Learning to navigate and read these charts is an absolutely invaluable skill that ALL musicians should master. Whatever your personal goals are as a bass player, mastering this skill is such an important part of your development. You simply can't go without it.</p>

It can give you much finer control over each note, and it can enable you can create a wide range of different textures when used correctly. Ultimately when used in combination with other picking techniques such as finger style and pick playing, it adds another layer of versatility and control to your bass playing - and is a technique no bass player should be without.</p>
<p>In this course Scott is going to take you right from the start, explaining why this technique is so important, the basic hand positions you can use right through to using multiple fingers of the plucking hand in combination with the palm mute and he'll even be throwing percussive slaps into the mix too.</p>

            <p>I haven't climbed Everest, nor have I been deep sea diving. I haven't even been to Timbuktu. But I have travelled to many far away places playing bass for some of the most talented musicians in the world, having the best time of my life doing so.</p>
<p>On a deserted island, I'd go insane without music, film, my wife Lisa and son Storey. Creative thinking, the mastery of communication and story telling is what does it for me, but sharing all I have learned throughout the years of being a professional musician with the world is what really drives and inspires me.</p>
<p>I'm a self confessed information addict. I believe deeply in teamwork, community, and collaboration. But most of all, I believe that by being ferociously driven and passionate about ScottsBassLessons I can make a difference to people's lives.</p>

Aside from his Motown-fuelled, muted bass tone, Danny’s known for his ability to work with students of all levels. “My mission is to teach my students how to develop their individuality and their tonal concept, what notes to play and when,” says Danny. “The bass player’s role is to keep time and to address the tonality of the moment.” His career highlights have included gigs with the likes of Robben Ford, Bo Diddley, Calypso Hurricane and the James Montgomery Blues Band. He also performs annually at the WESFEST concert series in Los Angeles in support of the Wehmiller Scholarship.</p>

His incredible technique enables him to play bass lines and chords simultaneously, which has proved extremely useful in both his solo and small combo work. He’s also worked alongside Mike Stern, Dave Weckl, Scott Henderson, Plas Johnson, Lew Tabackin, Paul Humphrey and Frank Gambale. Todd is also in demand as a clinician and has served as a faculty member at Musicians Institute (BIT), California Institute of the Arts, College of the Canyons and The Master’s College.</p>

Known globally as one of the UK’s leading solo bass guitarists, Steve is also a regular contributor to Bass Guitar Magazine and a strong advocate of all things bass. “It can be a little tricky to pin down exactly what I do,” says Steve. “I’m a solo bassist who spends a lot of his time making very un-bass-like sounds.” Above all, Steve is an incredible educator and a true inspiration to bass players the world over.</p>

            <p>Stefan Redtenbacher remains one of the most prominent composers, producers and all round bass monsters in the UK. Perhaps his most defining characteristic is the fact that he’s led his own band (Redtenbacher’s Funkestra) since 2005, something few bassists have attempted. It’s even more surprising when a career as a star sideman seemed like the obvious choice having graduated from Boston’s Berklee College of Music. His recording and performing credits include sessions for Steve Winwood, Kiki Dee, Jack Bruce, Amy Winehouse, Lulu, Sandie Shaw, Mica Paris, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Alexandra Burke, Adam Ant and Ollie Murs. All this invaluable experience has added an intimate knowledge of the music business to his already brimful mix of talents.</p>

            <p>For many musicians, seeing Cody Wright play bass for the first time is an unforgettable experience. Originally from Orlando, Florida, his awe-inspiring pick technique and his use of two-handed tapping readily caught the attention of Victor Wooten, the Jonathan Scales Fourchestra and guitarist Eric Gales. After nearly thirteen years as a fusion guitarist, Cody took up the bass in 2011 and you can be sure that he will be flying the four-string flag for some time to come. Cody is a certified instructor at ScottsBassLessons.com and a regular guest at Victor Wooten's Center for Music &amp; Nature. </p>

In addition to his mind-blowing technical prowess, Steve's musicianship has allowed him to fit into a diverse range of musical situations that have run the gamut from face-melting prog-metal to experimental microtonal jazz-funk.

        <h3 class="section__sub-title branded">Without being totally over the top... Hell yes!</h3>    </header>

                                        <p>When you become a student here at SBL you’ll quickly realise that every genre of music has something to teach us, whether it be Motown, Soul, Rock, Blues, Jazz or even black metal (yes - black metal!). There are unique styles of music being played in every corner of the world, all with their own sets of challenges and lessons to be learned.</p>
<p>That’s why we believe that every student needs to fully understand the core elements of what makes a great bass player, and then we help our students to channel those core elements into the different genre’s of music they want to focus on.</p>
