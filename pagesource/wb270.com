<p>I welcome, out of personal interest,&nbsp; comments from readers
about
any of the girls they have met, and reviews of wrestling sessions in
particular (as opposed to muscle worship, posing, dmination, beat down
and similar types of sessions) - (<a href="reviews.htm">go here for
more information on submitting reviews</a>
- but I now receive so many reviews, and have so little time to
maintain the list that I can't promise to use all of the reviews I get,
nor to
add them promptly. &nbsp;I do travel, and new additions &nbsp;to the
list ahead of &nbsp;most reviews. &nbsp;I generally don't post
complaints and negative
reviews. <br>
