				<p>When you log on to Outlook or Hotmail you will find several functions and features with a modern outlay. There are calendars and task functions as well as contact organization and webmail facilities which one can enjoy in the new Hotmail inbox. With Outlook and Hotmail merged as a new web based email platform, there is more accessibility provided and attracts more users across the world.</p>

<h2><span id="Login_features_of_Hotmail_in_yester_years">Login features of Hotmail in yester years</span></h2>
<p>The login steps for Hotmail account were simple in the initial days. The following steps were required to be completed to log into Hotmail accounts:</p>
<ul>
<li>One could access Hotmail domain by typing Hotmail.com or MSN.com</li>
<li>One could log on through the MSN home page or Hotmail main page.</li>
<li>The login panel only required one to key in their username and password.</li>
<li>One could check the option to stay logged in. This helped them to be able to access their inbox directly and was recommended for single user systems.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-61 aligncenter" src="http://hotmailloginmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/hotmail-old-login.png" alt="" width="274" height="238" /></p>
<p>The steps mentioned above helped users to log into their respective Hotmail accounts. However, often this simplified login process along with ordinary password choice and incorrect use of computers led to breaches in security of email accounts. Hence, today Microsoft introduced several features that will help to make logging into the account a more secure experience and ensure that your account does not get hacked easily.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-62 aligncenter" src="http://hotmailloginmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/organize-your-hotmail-world.png" alt="" width="571" height="258" srcset="http://hotmailloginmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/organize-your-hotmail-world.png 571w, http://hotmailloginmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/organize-your-hotmail-world-300x136.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px" /></p>
<h2><span id="Benefits_of_new_Outlook_domain">Benefits of new Outlook domain</span></h2>
<p>If you look at the features that Hotmail offers as part of Outlook there are several advantages to gain:</p>
<ul>
<li>The metro based interface design of Outlook can be enjoyed by Hotmail users as well.</li>
<li>One will enjoy unlimited storage as well as new calendar and contact management features.</li>
<li>It is easy to integrate one’s Hotmail account with the different Microsoft services. These include Office Online, OneDrive, Skype and others. These make it even more beneficial and attractive to the existing Hotmail users or new ones.</li>
<li>The account security aspects have been enhanced to ensure that users have a secure email experience as well as be able to log onto their account through mobile devices.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-63 aligncenter" src="http://hotmailloginmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/hotmail-login.png" alt="" width="575" height="460" srcset="http://hotmailloginmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/hotmail-login.png 575w, http://hotmailloginmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/hotmail-login-300x240.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" /></p>
<p>The login process of the new unified web mail platform of Hotmail provides access to a whole new inbox experience. One will find their old and existing correspondence here, which can be arranged with the new features and amenities that are provided on this platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are easy sweep features to organize clutter email as well as to organize emails in different folders.</li>
<li>There are several new features to enjoy as well, such as OneDrive, Skype, Office Online and other services that Microsoft provides. While OneDrive and Office Online are part of the inbox experience, there are other services that one can enjoy with the login details of Hotmail.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Hotmail_login_process">Hotmail login process</span></h2>
<p>The new login process comprises of visiting the new Outlook domain. For those who have not accessed their Hotmail account for long they can follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>One can simply type in Hotmail.com or MSN.com as they did before and they would be redirected to the new domain.</li>
<li>The front page displays a common login panel for all Microsoft services. This should not deter anyone as Hotmail is part of the offerings of Microsoft. One can start by keying in their username which is the email address in full.</li>
<li>The next page seeks your password information.</li>
<li>Once these details are correctly keyed in, you would get access to your existing Hotmail inbox with a new look and feel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-65 aligncenter" src="http://hotmailloginmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/hotmail-sign-up-login.png" alt="" width="372" height="290" srcset="http://hotmailloginmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/hotmail-sign-up-login.png 372w, http://hotmailloginmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/hotmail-sign-up-login-300x234.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px" /></p>
<h2><span id="New_Hotmail_account_features">New Hotmail account features</span></h2>
<p>For those who wish to create a new account in Hotmail, they will find a link to create a new account. The account creation form is common for all Microsoft services. All one needs to do is choose a unique username as well as a password. There are certain guidelines that need to be followed for password creation. These pertain to choosing a password that is at least eight characters long and is a combination of alphanumeric characters as well as special characters. There are additional details that are required as well. For instance, first and last name, an alternate email address, country of residence as well as a registered phone number, these details can also help to secure one’s account further and confirm identification in case one is logged out of their account.</p>
<h2><span id="Secure_login_features_of_Hotmail">Secure login features of Hotmail</span></h2>
<p>Security is another aspect that has been revamped for Hotmail users. There is the option of two step verification process which one can activate for their account. There are certain additional details that are required as input in the security settings of the account section of Hotmail. One needs to save additional details like an alternate email address as well as a registered phone number. Both details need to be verified.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-64 aligncenter" src="http://hotmailloginmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/enter-a-valid-email-addfress.png" alt="" width="361" height="268" srcset="http://hotmailloginmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/enter-a-valid-email-addfress.png 361w, http://hotmailloginmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/enter-a-valid-email-addfress-300x223.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" /></p>
<p>When these details are saved in the account, these can be used to retrieve lost password as well as verify one’s account access if Microsoft detects a login attempt from a different device.</p>
<p>In case one has forgotten their account password of Hotmail, there are different ways one can retrieve the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a link provided below the login panel. By clicking on this link, one is taken to the next page where one needs to key in the alternate email address provided or choose to get a text message with their registered number. Once the verification is done, one is provided access to create a new password for their account.</li>
<li>There is additional information that can be saved such as choosing two security questions and saving answers to them. At the time when one needs to retrieve their password these questions came to help.</li>
</ul>
<p>The two step verification process can be activated to make logging into your Hotmail account a more secure experience. This requires a code to be typed in, which is sent as a text message to the number you register on your account.

Today there are several users who have used Hotmail for several decades now. As it was bought by Microsoft soon, it was made part of the MSN platform through which, existing as well as new users could access Hotmail. Soon Microsoft decided to integrate the different email services that it owned. They were brought into the Live domain. Outlook was launched a few years back, freed from the desktop based email system that it represented in Windows. Today Microsoft has integrated Hotmail and Outlook on the same modern web mail interface.</p>

<h2><span id="Hotmail_sign_in_procedure_in_the_past">Hotmail sign in procedure in the past</span></h2>
<p>If you wished to create an account with Hotmail there were basic steps followed in the past such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to choose a username that is unique.</li>
<li>One had to choose a password which was not set by strict guidelines.</li>
<li>Personal details that were required were basic such as entering first and last name.</li>
<li>Optional information could be provided which were not mandatory.</li>
</ul>
<p>There were basic terms set for creating login details to a Hotmail account in the past. This led to the creation of multiple Hotmail accounts quite easily. The process was simpler as there were not adequate measures taken to ensure that malware attacks or spam infiltration were prevented as well as hacking attempts.</p>
<h2><span id="Changes_to_Hotmail_domain">Changes to Hotmail domain</span></h2>
<p>Soon Hotmail was acquired by Microsoft. This email service became associated with MSN. When one had to log onto MSN the login procedures were simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>The username and password were the fields that had to be filled in.</li>
<li>There was an option to save these details so that one could easily open their email account.</li>
</ul>
<p>The steps were basic and the process that existed for recovery of one’s account password was even simpler. There was a link provided for recovery of password below the login panel. All one needed to do was to ensure that they provided an alternate email address as well. Here the password would be sent as an email which allowed one to use the same to login into their Hotmail account.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-71 aligncenter" src="http://hotmailloginmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/opening-hotmail.png" alt="" width="391" height="198" srcset="http://hotmailloginmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/opening-hotmail.png 391w, http://hotmailloginmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/opening-hotmail-300x152.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" /></p>
<p>There were some problems that started to arise with member accounts with this basic sign in process. Many users found that their accounts were being hacked. There were also complaints of Hotmail addresses being given out due to which spam mails started to fill the inbox of members. For ensuring security of the accounts Microsoft took up several measures. One of the steps taken was to integrate the email services that it offered on a single platform. With Live domain being introduced, all Hotmail users came in this domain to log onto their accounts. There were several new measures introduced to ensure that users found it a safer experience to access their Hotmail account.</p>
<p>The Outlook web email service was then launched by Microsoft. Outlook had always been a desktop based mail server system for Windows users. It was recently launched as a free email service that one can access to the public web. With the integration of all email services under the Live domain, Outlook launched led to further integration. Microsoft integrated Hotmail as well under the same domain. Today the login panel for Outlook as well as Hotmail has been synonymous and one can use the same integrated login platform for gaining access to either of the web based email domains.</p>
<p>Hotmail account users might find it confusing as their email accounts have migrated several times. However the domain of Hotmail.com had been kept active for a long time and even today, if you type in Hotmail.com on your web browser, you would be redirected to Outlook.com. Even if you are unaware of the changes, you can be sure that finding Hotmail sign in link would be easy on Live or Outlook domain.</p>
