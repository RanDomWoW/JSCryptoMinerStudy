<p class="rt-txt"><b>Place: Seattle, Washington</b></p>
<div class="clearboth"></div>
<p class="m-top15">Like you, my eyesight has always been extremely important to me, but I never would have imagined that would lead to me becoming President and CEO of a leading eye health company.</p>
<p>It all started over 25 years ago as I watched my brother and best friend try to fulfill his dream of becoming a Navy fighter pilot. I remember sitting on our grandfather’s lap, listening to the stories of his life as a pilot. He described flying B-52s across the Atlantic, and how he’d shuttled the rich and famous around the world in their private jets. I could see how much my brother wanted to be just like him.</p>
<p>My brother did everything he could to prepare himself to become a fighter pilot. He played sports, was involved in student council, and volunteered in extra-curricular activities whenever he could. He went to college, got good grades, and stayed in shape. He even got his pilot’s license.</p>
<p>But there was one huge roadblock he could never overcome: perfect eyesight. At the time, the Navy required their pilot candidates to have perfect 20/20 vision in order to qualify – and my brother wasn’t even close.</p>
<p>You can imagine how heartbroken he was. And it broke my heart to watch him go through it. Fortunately, he eventually made his way to becoming an airline pilot (where they allow you to wear glasses), but the fact that he couldn’t fully achieve his dreams still ate away at him; and frankly, it did me too.</p>
<p>As we talked about it further, we began to look for ways to improve eyesight naturally. We researched what nutrients would support clear and healthy vision, and help protect against vision threatening eye diseases. We quickly became overwhelmed with the mountains of research that has been done on vision health and nutrition. But, we kept going. And we found some pretty awesome and seriously useful information.</p>
<p>So, <strong>if you are suffering from</strong> vision problems and deteriorating eyesight; trying to figure out what vitamins, minerals, and herbal supplements you need to maintain clear, crisp vision; looking for ways to ensure your eyes are getting the nutrients they need to function at 100%; or are concerned about cataracts, glaucoma, or macular degeneration and want to learn what vitamins may help to protect against these potentially blinding conditions… then you have come to the right place.</p>
<p>I’m going to show you exactly what vitamins, minerals, and herbal supplements research has not only shown to help improve your everyday vision and eye health, but may also help to protect against potentially blinding conditions such as glaucoma, cataracts and macular degeneration.</p>
<p>We are dedicated to the sole purpose of providing you with the information and resources you need to improve and maintain healthy and clear vision – naturally.</p>
<p>We’re not some large vitamin manufacturer or distributor that produces every nutritional supplement known to man. And we’re not a health food store that only carries the brands and types of supplements with the biggest markup or name.</p>
<p>Our single objective has been to comb through the tangles and <strong>piles of research</strong> pertaining to nutritional supplementation and your vision to provide you with the best, most comprehensive source of these nutrients. With this information you can finally&#8230;</p>
<h3 align="center">Ensure You&#8217;re Getting All the Vitamins, Minerals, and Herbal Supplements You Need for Your Eyes to Operate and Perform at Their Best.</h3>
<p>You see, we&#8217;ve discovered that there are actually <b>17 different vitamins</b>, minerals, and herbal supplements that have been linked to better vision health and protecting your eyesight from potentially blinding and all too common medical conditions.</p>
<p>And even if you eat like a fitness model and take your daily vitamins, it&#8217;s very likely that you&#8217;re still not getting these nutrients, or at least enough of these nutrients, in your daily diet.</p>
<p>But without adequate amounts of these 17 vitamins, minerals, and herbal supplements, your vision health could be <u>suffering</u>.</p>
<p>You could also be significantly increasing your chances of being diagnosed with a potentially blinding condition like cataracts, glaucoma, and macular degeneration.</p>
<p>Now before I tell you what we found to be the single best source of these vitamins, minerals, and herbal supplements, I want to tell you what each of them are and what, specifically, they can do for you&#8230;</p>
<h3 align="center">Here&#8217;s a List of the 17 Vitamins, Minerals, and Herbal Supplements that Research Shows Are Essential for Optimum Vision and Eye Health&#8230;</h3>
<div class="t-box">
<p>The following list is in alphabetical order and not in any order of importance&#8230;</p>
<h3 align="center">Essential Nutrient #1:  Alpha-Lipoic Acid</h3>
<p>There’s an army in our body that helps prevent cellular destruction caused by toxins and environmental factors or free radicals. That army goes by the name of antioxidants and you can find them everywhere – in the darkly pigmented fruits like grapes, hiding in yummy chocolates, and in juicy red meats too!</p>
<p>Alpha-lipoic acid is so healthy for your body that some people refer to it as the perfect antioxidant. It’s special because it is so versatile in that it helps to deactivate all sorts of different potential damage from free radicals. It also helps your body to effectively reuse vitamins C and E so that you get more oomph from your vitamins!</p>
<p>Alpha-lipoic acid can help <u>prevent</u> and deactivate potential damage from free radicals caused by inadequate diets, smoking, and sunlight.</p>
<h3 align="center">Essential Nutrients #2 &amp; #3: Bilberry and Bioflavonoids</h3>
<p>Bilberry is long-thought to be a fruit that <strong>helps improve your night vision</strong>. It is closely related to the cranberry and is high in a bioflavonoid that helps your eyes have more of the purple pigment rhodopsin, which helps you to see better. A flavonoid is a pigment, like purple, that has an excellent antioxidant quotient to help your body fight off free radical damage.</p>
<p>Bilberry and Bioflavonoids are so well-regarded as a way to help night vision that British pilots in World War II are said to have consumed bilberry jam in order to improve their night vision! Consuming flavonoids like bilberry has been linked to a reduction in heart disease, macular degeneration, legal blindness, and even cancer.</p>
<h3 align="center">Essential Nutrient #4: Chromium</h3>
<p>Chromium is an important trace mineral that assists your body in breaking down proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, as well as aids your metabolism in converting glucose to energy.</p>
<p>Chromium is important for your eyes too – folks who are low in this important mineral have been shown to be at a greater risk of developing increased intraocular eye pressure. Intraocular eye pressure is more and more common these days as so many people strain to look at computer screens all day long, tiring out those overused eye muscles and putting unnecessary stress upon them. If you include more chromium-rich foods in your diet, you may find that you’re straining to see and read less and less.</p>
<p>Foods high in chromium include  beef, liver, eggs, spinach, and wheat germ.</p>
<h3 align="center">Essential Nutrient #5:  Copper Gluconate</h3>
<p>Copper is an important trace element that your body needs in order to form collagen, which builds our connective tissues. Copper helps our blood produce oxygen-producing hemoglobin, which helps our bodies enjoy greater circulation and increased oxygen levels. Without enough copper, hemoglobin levels in your bloodstream may fall and this can lead to vision loss. Liver, seafood, and beans are all foods that are high in copper.</p>
<h3 align="center">Essential Nutrient #6: Eyebright</h3>
<p><strong>Eyebright is an herb long said to help eye inflammation.</strong> Eyebright can be useful as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory herb, and as an astringent, as it helps to tighten the membranes around your eyes while improving circulation around them. The tannins in Eyebright help reduce inflammation and bring more vitamins A and C to your eyes. Eyebright is truly an herb with a fitting name.</p>
<h3 align="center">Essential Nutrient #7: Ginkgo Biloba</h3>
<p>The ancient herb ginkgo, an antioxidant, has been confirmed by numerous studies to increase blood flow to your retinas. This increased blood flow to your retinas can help to delay retinal deterioration and damage, <strong>improving your visual acuity!</strong> Ginkgo has been shown in some studies to be particularly useful to those suffering from macular degeneration and retinas damaged by diabetes.</p>
<h3 align="center">Essential Nutrient #8: Glutathione</h3>
<p>Like alpha-lipoic acid, glutathione is another important amino acid that helps your eyes. This amino acid has been linked to <strong>preventing retinal disease, diabetes-induced blindness, cataracts, and even glaucoma.</strong> Glutathione helps to protect the important tissue surrounding the lenses of your eyes.</p>
<p>If you want to get more glutathione in your diet, look to sulfur-heavy foods such as eggs, garlic, and asparagus, as well as watermelon and grapefruits.</p>
<h3 align="center">Essential Nutrient #9: Lutein (containing Zeaxanthin)</h3>
<p>Lutein, and its companion zeaxanthin, are found within the eye’s retina. They are a yellow pigment and this yellow pigment helps protect our eyes, almost like sunglasses! Lutein and zeaxanthin have been shown to <strong>lower your risk of cataracts and macular degeneration.</strong> In fact, folks with low levels of lutein have been linked with greater incidences of age-induced macular degeneration. Because blue-eyed beauties have less natural pigments in their eyes, it’s been shown that they need even more lutein and zeaxanthin in their diets.</p>
<p>To get more of these important nutrients in your life, look to the yellow, orange, and red fruits and vegetables for help. Tomatoes, carrots, and squash are all rich in lutein.</p>
<h3 align="center">Essential Nutrient #10: N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC)</h3>
<p>NAC, as N-Acetyl Cysteine is abbreviated, is another amino acid your body needs. NAC is essential in helping your body build up proteins and helps refresh your body with more of the essential glutathione amino acid that we discussed. Important to the immune system, NAC has been shown to <strong>help prevent the loss of vision</strong> and even has aided mice in not losing their ability to see in color!</p>
<h3 align="center">Essential Nutrient #11: Quercetin</h3>
<p>An antioxidant, antihistamine, and anti-inflammatory, flavonoid Quercetin is a wonderful natural substance that can help protect your capillaries and prevent bruising! Quercetin has been shown to improve how your body processes vitamin C and makes it more effective for you. It has been shown to <strong>lower your risk of developing cataracts.</strong> Members of the blueberry family, like blueberries, blackberries, and cherries, are all high in superpower Quercetin.</p>
<h3 align="center">Essential Nutrient #12: Rutin</h3>
<p>Plant-based Rutin helps to strengthen your capillaries and is thought to successfully treat retinopathy. Have some buckwheat pancakes for breakfast then, because Rutin is especially found in the buckwheat plant! You can also get your intake of Rutin from black or green tea as well as citrus fruits.</p>
<h3 align="center">Essential Nutrient #13: Selenium</h3>
<p>Selenium is another trace mineral necessary for our bodies to defend against infections and boost immunity. As an antioxidant, selenium can neutralize free radical damage in your eye’s lens and macula. Studies have linked low selenium levels with development of cataracts. Selenium is important to your body’s absorption of vitamin E as well. Chicken, liver, wheat germ, and garlic are all great sources of selenium.</p>
<h3 align="center">Essential Nutrient #14: Vitamin A</h3>
<p>Eat your carrots! It’s true: vitamin A may as well be called vitamin EYE. <strong>Vitamin A is essential to our eye health and vision.</strong> Our retinas need vitamin A to properly function and produce the pigment rhodopsin. Vitamin A is so key to healthy eyes that poor night vision can actually be caused by a deficiency in this vitamin. Foods rich in vitamin A include spinach, cantaloupes, and sweet potatoes.</p>
<p><strong>Vitamin A can help:</strong></p>
<p class="indent2"><img src="https://www.rebuildyourvision.com/wp-content/themes/canvas/images/ncheckmark2.gif" width="24" height="23" align="left" />  your eyes adjust to changes in light</p>
<p class="indent2"><img src="https://www.rebuildyourvision.com/wp-content/themes/canvas/images/ncheckmark2.gif" width="24" height="23" align="left" />  prevent blindness caused by macular degeneration</p>
<p class="indent2"><img src="https://www.rebuildyourvision.com/wp-content/themes/canvas/images/ncheckmark2.gif" width="24" height="23" align="left" />  prevent the formation of cataracts</p>
<p class="indent2"><img src="https://www.rebuildyourvision.com/wp-content/themes/canvas/images/ncheckmark2.gif" width="24" height="23" align="left" />  keep your eyes moist</p>
<h3 align="center">Essential Nutrient #15: Vitamin C</h3>
<p>Vitamin C is a superpower antioxidant that has been linked to preventing cataracts by as much as 70 percent, according to one study. Vitamin C has also been shown to reduce macular degeneration and eye pressure issues in glaucoma sufferers. Though orange juice has lots of this important nutrient, you can also find vitamin C is leafy green vegetables such as kale, collards, and brussel sprouts.</p>
<h3 align="center">Essential Nutrient #16: Vitamin E</h3>
<p>Another superpower vitamin, vitamin E helps to lower your risk of macular degeneration and cataracts. One study suggests that daily consumption of vitamin E can <strong>reduce your risk of cataracts by as much as half!</strong></p>
<p>Vitamin E has also been shown to protect against damage from free radicals. In fact, one of the symptoms of a vitamin E deficiency is impaired vision. Wheat germ is your first stop when you want to eat foods that are rich in vitamin E, but don’t ignore your greens like spinach, kale, and collard greens.</p>
<h3 align="center">Essential Nutrient #17: Zinc</h3>
<p>Zinc is important in helping your eyes convert the beta-carotene in carrots and other veggies into usable vitamin A. Your eyes have the most amount of zinc in your whole body and need zinc to function properly. Oysters and red meat are highest in zinc, but vegetarians can get zinc from soy, beans, and grains.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see, these 17 vitamins, minerals, and herbal supplements are absolutely essential to your eye health. They play a critical role in the support of your eyesight, as well as protecting against potentially blinding conditions like glaucoma, macular degeneration, and cataracts.</p>
<p>Now the thought of trying to take a pill for each of these nutrients probably seems a bit overwhelming, to say the least. Besides having to spend a small <u>fortune</u>, you&#8217;d spend half of your day doing nothing but swallowing pills!</p>
<p>And if you tried to get <strong>adequate amounts</strong> of these nutrients in your diet, you&#8217;d have to consume about 10,000 calories a day!</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s got to be an <strong>easier way</strong> to get these 17 vitamins, minerals, and herbal supplements that your eyes need, right?</p>
<p>Pay close attention&#8230;</p>
<p>After sorting through the masses of research and determining what nutrients you really need for clear and healthy vision, we went to one of the nation&#8217;s top supplement manufacturers and developed&#8230;</p>
<h3 align="center">A Formula that Contains All 17 of These Vitamins, Minerals, and Herbal Supplements in One Pill!</h3>
<div align="center"><img class="f-right" src="https://www.rebuildyourvision.com/wp-content/themes/canvas/images/VitaminLabel_80.jpg" alt="Vision Supplement" width="138" height="268" align="right" hspace="10" /></div>

<h3 class="indent-colored" align="center">&#8220;I no longer have any need for my eyeglasses or need them to drive.&#8221;</h3>
<p class="indent-colored">I began using Ocu-Plus late last year and the difference it has made in my vision has been astounding. I went to renew my license and when they checked my vision the agent said I no longer have any need for my eyeglasses or need them to drive. I was so happy. I have used glasses since I was around 10. I can sing the praises of your Ocu-Plus. Thank you Tyler for introducing me to them. My family is very surprised that at my age that I don’t need my eyeglasses anymore. I rest my eyes occasionally as you indicate as I work on a computer for a living. Thanks again!</p>

This morning I went in to see Dr. Reynolds (I have only been seeing him for about 2 years now) and I told him how I wanted him to go through the records and see if Ocu-plus is helping my vision.</p>
<p class="indent-colored">I then described Ocu-plus from what I knew and asked him to verify if he could discern improvement in vision from the records. He was a little amused at first, but as he went through all the records his attitude changed. I didn&#8217;t completely understand all his descriptions and technical words but the gist of it was definitely, whatever you were taking has helped, especially in the last year.”</p>

<h3 class="indent-colored" align="center">&#8220;The symptoms have considerably lessened. I feel a great deal of improvement compared to when I first learned that I have glaucoma.&#8221;</h3>
<p class="indent-colored"><img style="padding: 0 10px;" src="https://www.rebuildyourvision.com/wp-content/themes/canvas/images/Perla.jpg" alt="eye vitamins" width="120" height="126" align="right" hspace="12" vspace="5" />&#8220;I am a QA analyst and my job requires me to work on computers 7.5 hours a day. Last November, I was having blurry vision, headache and dizziness for days, so I decided to go to an optometrist after work. I was thinking that maybe he would only prescribe glasses, but I was shocked to find out that I have glaucoma. He said that the back of my eye was three times larger than normal and that my eyes were overstrained. He prescribed the use of reading glasses whenever I work on the computer.</p>
<p class="indent-colored">I could not readily go to a specialist as it takes months to get an appointment. I was feeling really frustrated, so I tried to find a remedy that I think would alleviate my condition. Luckily, I discovered Ocu-Plus Formula and decided to give it a try.</p>
<p class="indent-colored">I started taking Ocu-Plus only last December 14th upon receipt of my first bottle. After that, I noticed that my condition started to improve. My eyes don&#8217;t look and feel 100% normal anymore, but in such a short period of time, the symptoms have considerably lessened. I feel a great deal of improvement compared to when I first learned that I have glaucoma. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Tyler Sorensen for sharing this great product, the Ocu-Plus Formula.&#8221;</p>
