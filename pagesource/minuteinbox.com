					<h2>What is E-mail</h2>
<p>The acronym E-mail stands for Electronic Mail. This service has been one of the major means of communication and was made famous by the internet and the world wide web. The very first email was sent over 40 years ago and ever since, has become imbibed into the everyday life, most especially for businesses and organizations.</p> 
<h2>How E-mailing works</h2>
<p>Initially, email was set up for text, mostly brief and informal communication over a computer network. Over time, the functionalities of the email service grew, and it allowed for attachment of additional data such as image files and spreadsheets in email messages as well as the option for sending to multiple recipients at the same time.</p>
<p>When an email message is sent, it goes to the outgoing mail server through a Simple Mail-Transfer Protocol popularly called SMTP.  The SMTP serves as a post office which checks for addresses and then sends the email message to the provided email address or addresses as the case may be. The sent email message is fetched using the POP or IMAP client, when this happens, the email message is available for viewing.</p>
<h2>The importance of Emails.</h2>
<p>Even though there are many email service providers and a couple of functionalities vary depending on the vendor, e.g., the 10 minute mail, there are a few of the key features of email services that have led to its continual growth. Some of the features include the fact that they allow for easy and quick communication, are flexible and not limited by time zones, they permit the filtering of emails, are useful in one-to-many communications. Emails addresses are also used to set up accounts on other Internet platforms such as social media sites and -commerce websites.</p> 
<h2>Uses of the Emails and Email Addresses.</h2>
<p>Over time, with the increased use of emails and email technologies, there has become more and more uses of the email services that have made them form an integral part of our daily lives. Emails have become essential tools of communication, marketing, promotion. The vast reach and quick accessibility also make it one of the most used internet service. From sending documents, links, other attachments to any part of the world; the email comes in very handy and the best part, it is instantly delivered. Businesses use emails for internal and external correspondence.</p> 
<p>Also, the email allows for flexible communication that permits the sender and the receiver to communicate effectively irrespective of their varying schedules.</p>  
<p>The email address has also come to play critical roles; they serve as means of identification and as a post office system. We receive all forms of communication through them, and a lot of the time, our email boxes serve as a storage volt which holds personal information such as card detail. Since the email box can be used as a storage volt and the email address as means of identification, it is necessary that access to them is carefully managed. In the event of unwanted access, either through hackers or spammers, the information could be misused.  Temporal email addresses such as the 10 minute mail help bring a solution to this problem.</p>
<h2>Temporary Email and Email Addresses</h2>
<p>The temporary emails like the 10 minute mail have brought about a more innovative use to email service provision. Even though email addresses and mailboxes have been known to last forever, the temporal emails have extended this functionality and still inculcate in them all the other features of permanent emails. With this service, the user gets to have more power and control over who gets to access to the email box. With the growing online security risks, it is vital that we pay attention to who we give our email addresses to, the kinds of information we have in our email boxes as well as the platforms we use our emails to register in.  Apart from the security concerns, there are other concerns such as maintaining a properly managed mailbox. To have a properly maintained mailbox we have to try as much as we can to limit who has access to that particular mailbox.</p> 
<p>Not all messages can be considered spam; there are promotional messages which are part of the email marketing scheme used by businesses. The promotional messages aren’t meant to cause harm but when there are too many of them in a mailbox, the mailbox appears cluttered and disorganized, and this can cause readability issues for the owner/user.  To all these problems, the temporary email and email addresses can provide solutions and help the user maintain and manage his/her email box correctly. Since the email can be called the user’s online identity, it is advisable to keep a level of animosity.</p>
