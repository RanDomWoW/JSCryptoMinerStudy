<p>The vast majority of Philadelphia&rsquo;s vibrant community of restaurants, bars, delis and other eateries share one often overlooked trait: they cook with natural gas. To celebrate that, we&rsquo;re getting ready to launch Flame to Table, a web series that shares the diversity and quality of Philadelphia&rsquo;s chefs and cooks, and the food they cook. Watch the trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zPkHq9WvmI&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
