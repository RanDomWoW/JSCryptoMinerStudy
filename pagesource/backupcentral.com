			<p>If you haven&#8217;t looked into how your data protection vendors are preparing for the General Data Protection Regulation (GPDR), you&#8217;re already behind the power curve.Â  It goes into effect May 25, 2018. Hopefully this article can get you up to speed so you can start pressuring your vendors about how they are going to help you comply with this incredibly big regulation.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I&#8217;m not a lawyer or a GDPR expert. My goal of this blog is to get you thinking and maybe scare you a little bit.Â  Nothing in this blog should be construed as legal advice.</p>
<p>Disclaimer #2: There is no such thing as a GDPR-compliant product, and definitely no such thing as GDPR-certified. A product can help you comply with GDPR.Â  A product can say &#8220;we are able to help you comply with articles 15 and 17,&#8221; but a product alone will not make you GDPR compliant.Â  And there is no certification body to provide a GDPR certification. Anyone who says that is making it up.</p>

<p>Although this is a European Union (EU) regulation, you are subject to it if you are storing personally identifiable information (PII) (referred to by GPDR as &#8220;personal data&#8221;) about European citizens (referred to by GDPR as &#8220;data subjects&#8221;) living within the EU. Where your company is headquartered is irrelevant.</p>
<p>A business transaction is not required.Â  A marketing survey targeting EU residents appears sufficient to require your company to comply with GDPR.Â  An EU resident (who was not targeted specifically) filling out a form on your US website that does not have an EU domain might not trigger GDPR protection for that person.Â  My non-legal advice is that you should look into how you&#8217;re preparing for the requirements.</p>

<p>Companies not complying with the data privacy aspects of GDPR can be fined 4% of annual revenue, or 20 million Euros, <em>whichever is greater</em>.Â  It hasn&#8217;t gone into effect yet, and no one has been fined yet, so we don&#8217;t yet know just how tough the courts are going to be. But that&#8217;s what the regulation allows.</p>
<h2>How does GDPR affect data protection?</h2>
<p>There are several aspects to GDPR protection, but only a few of them affect your data protection system. For example, there is a requirement to gain consent before storing personal data. That responsibility falls way outside the data protection system. But let&#8217;s look at some parts that many systems are going to have a really hard time with.</p>

<p>GDPR has articles that talk about general data security, but I think any modern backup system should be able to comply with those articles. The things about GDPR that I think data protection people will struggle with are articles 15, 16 and 17: the right to data access by the subject, the right to correction, and the right to erasure (AKA &#8220;right to be forgotten&#8221;).</p>
<p><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-15-gdpr/">Article 15: Right to data access by subject</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you have data on a data subject (i.e. EU citizen), and assuming that data is subject to GDPR, the subject has a right to see that data. This includes any and all data stored on primary storage, snapshots, backup storage, and archives.Â  Try to think about how you would comply with that request today and you see where my concern is. Archive software might be ready for this, but most backup systems are incapable of delivering information in this manner.</p>
<p><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-16-gdpr/">Article 16: Right to correction</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A data subject has the right to have incorrect data corrected. This may not directly affect the backup and archive systems, but it might.</p>
<p><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/">Article 17, Right to erasure (AKA &#8220;the right to be forgotten&#8221;)</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This one is the one that truly scares me as a data protection specialist.Â  If a company cannot prove they have a legitimate business reason for continued storage of a particular data subject&#8217;s personal data, the data subject has the right to have it deleted. And that means all of it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As previously mentioned, we don&#8217;t have any case law on this yet, and we don&#8217;t yet know the degree to which the EU courts will order a company to delete someone&#8217;s data from backups and archives. But this is article that has me the most worried.</p>
<h2>I told you so</h2>
<p>The customers that are in real trouble are those that use their backup systems as archive systems, since most backup systems are simply incapable of doing these things. They will be completely incapable of complying with Articles 15-17 of GPDR.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been telling customers for years to not use their backup system as an archive system. If you are one of the ones who listened to me, and any long term data is stored in an archive system, you&#8217;re pretty much ready for GDPR.Â  A good archive should be able to satisfy these requirements.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;ve got data from five years ago sitting on a dedupe appliance or backup tapes, you could be in a world of hurt. There simply isn&#8217;t a way to collect in one place all data on a given subject, and there&#8217;s definitely no way to delete it from your backups. Each record is a tiny record inside a filesystem backup stored in some kind of blog, such as tar file or the equivalent for your backup system.</p>
<h2>What are your vendors saying?</h2>
<p>Has anyone had any conversations about this with their data protection vendors?Â  What are they saying?Â  I&#8217;d really love to hear your stories.</p>

<h2>The expensive way: 24&#215;7 VMs and pre-provisioned block storage</h2>
<p>Running one or more VMs in the cloud 24&#215;7 (like you would in a datacenter) is a great way to drive up your costs. It&#8217;s generally going to be more expensive than running the same VMs in house (if you&#8217;re running them 24&#215;7).Â  It&#8217;s difficult to come up with the incremental cost of an individual VM, as <a href="http://gabrielchapman.com/price-per-vm-calculations-an-exercise-in-crazy/">this article</a> attests. But generally speaking, you should be able to run a VM onsite for less than the cost of running that same VM in the cloud. It makes sense; it&#8217;s called markup.</p>
<p>Storage can also be more expensive in the cloud for the same reasons.Â  If you&#8217;re provisioning large chunks of block storage (e.g. EBS in AWS) before you actually consume it, your costs are going to be higher than if you only pay for storage as you use it. This is really only possible with object storage.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also important to note that moving a VM to the cloud doesn&#8217;t get rid of all the typical system administration tasks associated with said VM. The OS still needs updating; the applications still need updating.Â  Sure, you don&#8217;t have to worry about swapping out the power supply, but most people let a vendor do that part anyway. But it&#8217;s important to understand that moving a VM to the cloud doesn&#8217;t make it magically start caring for itself.</p>

<p>In the public cloud, your costs are directly tied to how much storage, network and compute you use.Â That means that if you have an application that can dynamically scale up and down its use of cloud resources, you might be able to save money in the cloud, even if the per-hour costs are higher than those you would have onsite. This is because generally speaking, you don&#8217;t save money in the datacenter by turning off a VM. The resources attached to that VM are still there, so your costs don&#8217;t do down. But if you have an app that can reduce its compute resources â especially to the point of turning off VMs, you can save a lot of money.</p>
<p>This also goes true for storage. If you are using object storage instead of block storage, you pay only for what you use as you use it.Â  As backups expire and objects are deleted out of the object store, your costs decrease.Â  This is very different than how pre-provisioned block storage behaves, where deleting files doesn&#8217;t save you money.</p>
<h2>Use the cloud the way its meant to be used.</h2>
<p>If your backup software is just running software in 24&#215;7 VMs in the cloud, and if they require you to provision block storage for said VMs, then they&#8217;re using the cloud in the way that cloud experts generally agree is a great way to drive up costs and not add a lot of value.</p>
<p>Your costs will go up and your manageability stays the same. You&#8217;re still dealing with an OS and application that needs to be updated in the same way it would be onsite. You still have to increase or decrease your software or storage licenses as your needs grow.</p>

<h2>Don&#8217;t use APFS images for backups</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve never liked these disk images that Apple makes ââ as a backup method.Â  This is just another example of why.Â  For those unfamiliar with them, they&#8217;re like a fancy .ISO image.Â  It&#8217;s one big file that you can mount as a file system. The &#8220;sparse&#8221; part is what the industry would call a thin-provisioned version of this image.Â  That is, you tell it how big it&#8217;s allowed to grow, but it will only consume the amount of space that is actually put into the image.</p>
<p>The problem that was recently discovered is that if the APFS sparse image runs out of virtual space, it will just keep writing the files like nothing&#8217;s wrong.Â  Even worse, the files will appear to have been copied, as they&#8217;ll be in RAM.Â  Unmount the disk image and remount it and you&#8217;ll find that the files were never copied.Â  Surely Apple needs to fix this.</p>
<p>The one place you&#8217;ll see a disk image is if you buy a Time Capsule Time Machine backup appliance.Â  I&#8217;m not sure why, but they chose to do it this way, instead of just mirroring the filesystem, the way Time Machine does on a local machine.Â  I&#8217;m sure they had their reasons, but this is where you&#8217;ll see disk images.Â  (Actually, I haven&#8217;t looked into the details of the Time Capsules in a while, so they could have changed.Â  But I can&#8217;t think of any other place where you&#8217;d see such a beast.)</p>

<p>Nine years ago I wrote <a href="https://www.backupcentral.com/time-machine/">an article about how I wasn&#8217;t a huge fan of Time Machine</a>, and how I really didn&#8217;t like Time Capsules because of their disk images &#8212; and how they can get corrupted. Time Machine is nice for upgrades or a local copy, but I don&#8217;t think you should rely on it as your only backup.</p>
<p>This is why we do real backups.Â  Real backups are scheduled and happen all the time without you having to do anything. Their data is stored somewhere else, which today typically means the cloud. I simply can&#8217;t think of another viable way to backup mobile users and home users.</p>

			<p>Don&#8217;t get your backup advice from security people.

<p>Windows-based backup products that store data in a directory are a huge security risk. In fact, many customers of such products have already reported my worst fears: their backups were encrypted with the same ransomware that infected their servers.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t an anti-Windows rant, or an anti-BackupProductX rant. It&#8217;s simply acknowledging the elephant in the room.</p>
<ol>
<li>If your backup server is accessible via the same network your computers are on, it can be attacked via the same things that attack your computers.</li>
<li>If your backup server runs the same OS as your computers â especially if it&#8217;s the OS that most ransomware attacks happen on (Windows) â it can be infected with the same ransomware</li>
<li>If your backups are stored in a directory (as opposed to a tape drive, an S3 object, or a smart appliance <em>not</em> accessible via SMB/NFS), they can be infected if your backup server is infected.</li>
<li>If your backups are stored on a network mount via NFS/SMB, you&#8217;re giving the ransomware even more ways to attack you.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to be guilty of doing what the security guy did, so I&#8217;ll say this: research what you can do to protect your systems from ransomware. But I&#8217;ll do my best to give some general advice.</p>
<p>I know the best advice I&#8217;ve read is to keep up-to-date on patches and to disable Remote Desktop Management on Windows.Â  There are also default SMB shares in Windows that should be disabled.</p>
<p>You can also make sure that your backups aren&#8217;t just stored in a directory. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s the default setup for most inexpensive backup software products. You need to investigate if the software you&#8217;re using supports another way to store backups.Â  If not, it&#8217;s time to think about a different product.</p>
<p>The same goes true for those currently storing backups on an NFS/SMB share. Investigate if your backup software has the ability to store backups on that device without using NFS/SMB. If not, make sure you lock down that share as much as you can. Again, if not, it&#8217;s time to think about another backup product.</p>

<p>A <em>true</em> cloud-based data protection service might be the best way to do this.Â  In a true cloud-based system, you never see the backup servers. You don&#8217;t know what they are and never login to them. You login to a web-based portal, and the actual servers that make this happen are completely invisible to you.Â  (Similar to the way the servers that make salesforce.com happen are invisible to you.)</p>
<p>If your backup servers are invisible to you, they&#8217;re invisible to your attackers. If there&#8217;s no way to directly access your backup â unless you&#8217;ve specifically setup such access for a recovery or DR test â then ransomware can&#8217;t get to those backups either.</p>
<p>It should go without saying that this recommendation does not apply if your &#8220;cloud&#8221; data protection vendor is just putting backup software on VMs that you manage in the cloud â what many have dubbed &#8220;cloud washing.&#8221; If you&#8217;re seeing your backup servers as VMs in the cloud, they&#8217;re just as much of a risk as they are if they were in your data centers. It&#8217;s on the reasons why these cloud washing vendors aren&#8217;t really giving you the full benefit of the cloud if all they&#8217;re doing is putting VMs up there.</p>

<p>Yes, Iron Mountain has had many very public incidents of losing tapes. You can do a google search for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=iron+mountain+loses+tapes&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS690US690&amp;oq=iron+mountain+loses+tapes&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l2.4575j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Iron Mountain Loses Tapes</a> to see what I&#8217;m talking about.Â  When all these stories started hitting the news back in 2005 (thanks to California&#8217;s new law requiring you to report such things), Iron Mountain&#8217;s official response was, &#8220;Iron Mountain performs upwards of five million pickups and deliveries of backup tapes each year, with greater than 99.999% reliability. Nevertheless, since the beginning of the year, four events of human error at Iron Mountain resulted in the loss of a customer&#8217;s computer backup tapes. While four losses is not a large number in comparison to an annual rate of five million transportation events, any loss is important to customers and to Iron Mountain &#8230; Iron Mountain is advising its customers that current, commonly used disaster recovery processes do not address increased requirements for protecting personal information from inadvertent disclosure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tape vaulting company I used to use back in the day lost one or two of our tapes a year.Â  We gave them about 50 tapes a day, and retrieved 50 more back.Â  We tracked each individual tape, and were linked into their system to show when the tapes made it into the vault.Â  Every once in a while, there would be a discrepancy where one of the tapes would not show up in the vault.Â  This resulted in a search, and inevitably the tape would be found somewhere along the way.Â  Good times.</p>
<p>I remember one vaulting customer that received a box of tapes that weren&#8217;t theres.Â  When they called their rep, they had him read the bar codes off the tapes.Â  They couldn&#8217;t figure out whose they were, so the vaulting company said they should keep the tapes!</p>
<p>As long as media vaulting companies employ humans to be the &#8220;man&#8221; in the van, this problem will continue.Â  Humans do dumb things.Â  Humans make mistakes. So until these companies start hiring robots to pick up and deliver tapes, we will continue to see these problems.Â  However, I think much of the world will have moved to electronic vaulting by then.</p>
<h2>I&#8217;ve always liked electronic vaulting</h2>

<p>If you&#8217;re not going to use tapes to get your data offsite, you can use electronic vaulting.Â  This can be accomplished via a few different methods.</p>
<p>Onsite &amp; Offsite Target Dedupe Appliance</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are a number of vendors that will be happy to sell you an appliance that will dedupe any backups you send to it. Those deduped backups are then replicated to another dedupe appliance offsite. This has been the primary model for the last 15 years or so to accomplish electronic vaulting. The problem is that these appliances are very expensive, and you have to buy two of them â as well as power, cool, and maintain them. It&#8217;s the most expensive of the three options mentioned here.</p>
<p>Source dedupe to offsite appliance</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It makes more sense to buy backup software that will dedupe the data before it&#8217;s sent to an appliance. This appliance can be offsite, so that data is immediately sent offsite.Â  It can even be a virtual appliance running as a VM in the cloud.Â  Most people exploring this option opt for an onsite copy that replicates to the offsite appliance or VM.Â  Most vendors selling this type of solution tend to want to charge you for both copies.</p>
<p>Source dedupe to a cloud service</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you are backing up to a true cloudÂ <em>service</em> (not just backup software running in some VMs in the cloud), and you are deduping data before it is sent to the cloud. Vendors that use this model tend to only charge you for the cloud copy. If they support a local appliance for quick recoveries, they tend not to charge for that copy. That makes this option the least expensive of the three</p>
<h2>Fire the man, get a plan</h2>
<p>Wow, I like that!Â  There are a number of ways you can now have onsite and offsite backups without ever touching a tape or talking to a man in the van down by the river.Â  Look into them and join the new millennium.</p>

			<p>No one likes hardware; they only like what they can do with it.Â  And I say this as a geek who has built plenty of PCs in my house, including a <a href="https://hackintosh.com/">Hackintosh</a>.Â  What kind of sick weirdo builds their own Mac?Â  Well, you know what? ThatÂ Hackintosh illustrates the perils of hardware in three ways.</p>
<h2>Hardware gets marked up</h2>
<p>The first peril of hardware is why I did this: Apple&#8217;s crazy markup on hardware. Why did I go through the difficulty of finding and buying components that were compatible with MacOS?Â  Why did I go through the rigmarole necessary to fool the MacOS installer into installing on something that wasn&#8217;t a real Mac?</p>

<p>I wanted to run MacOS on a server powerful enough to run Adobe Premier Pro well, and the MacPro I wanted was something like $4-5000.Â  But I could build a Hackintosh for around $1500, so I did.</p>
<p>This is why storage customers revolted against traditional proprietary storage vendors in favor of software-defined startups that allowed them to use off-the-shelf hardware that wasn&#8217;t ridiculously marked up.Â  People started realizing that hardware is hardware, and rarely is hardware special enough to warrant a huge markup.</p>
<h2>Hardware must be maintained</h2>
<p>Hardware breaks.Â  Power supplies die, disks stop spinning, and fans stop blowing. This is why every production piece of hardware typically comes with a service agreement specifying how quickly the vendor should respond when a problem occurs.</p>

<p>At no time is this peril more acute than the last few weeks. The spectre of the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities is wreaking havoc on hardware land. First Intel came out with a new microcode version to address the vulnerabilities, then Microsoft, RedHat, and other Linux vendors came out with OS patches.Â  Then people that installed them started seeing spontaneous reboots. So they all started pulling their patches, and Microsoft even released an out-of-band update that disabled the microcode patches if you installed them.Â  It&#8217;s been a tough couple of weeks for those that must maintain hardware.</p>
<p>Meanwhile customers who are using services like Salesfore.com, Office365, Gmail, and yes, the <a href="http:www.druva.com">Druva Cloud Platform</a>, didn&#8217;t have to worry about maintaining the hardware underneath those systems. The service providers had plenty of work to do, for sure. The cloud is not magic. There is no such thing as the cloud; it&#8217;s only someone else&#8217;s datacenter. But people who were using true cloud services simply didn&#8217;t have to worry about maintaining the hardware behind the services they were using.</p>
<p>This brings me to the point of the companies in the data protection space who have now certified that their product runs in AWS. Yes, this allows them to say that they work &#8220;in the cloud.&#8221; But it&#8217;s important to distinguish this from a cloud <em>service offering</em>, where hardware is not your problem. Customers of such backup solutions that are &#8220;running in the cloud&#8221; are having just as many problems with their cloud backup servers as they are with their onsite servers.Â  Because even virtual hardware has to be maintained. It may be someone else&#8217;s hardware (i.e. you don&#8217;t own the server your cloud VM is running on), but you still have to maintain it.</p>
<h2>Hardware is a capital expense</h2>
<p>The Hackintosh I built was only $1500, but what if it had been $100,000?Â  Hardware of all kinds requires a significant amount of capital outlay.Â  Maybe you can finance it and maybe you need to come up with the actual cash to buy it outright.Â  Either way, it&#8217;s going to stay on your books for years.</p>

<p>Capital expenses can be really difficult to get approved. I remember working at a place where every single item over $1,000 was a capital expense, and getting capital expenses approved took months â even years.Â  I remember doing all sorts of things to work around that issue.</p>
<p>Real hardware also <em>exists</em>.Â  If you bought it for a project that changed directions, you&#8217;re stuck with that hardware.Â  If your project needs faster hardware, you have to upgrade â leaving the old hardware in the dust (literally). This is perhaps the most compelling thing about moving apps to the cloud.Â  If you change your mind, you just delete the VM.</p>

<p>This brings me full circle. The hardware isn&#8217;t what&#8217;s important; the service is what&#8217;s important. Consider my opening story of the Hackintosh. My need was to edit video. The solution to that need was Adobe Premiere Pro â which I already owned.Â  But I owned the MacOS version, so I needed a Mac.Â  I couldn&#8217;t afford a MacPro, so I built one. (I just found out the Hackintosh I built is running fine, BTW.)</p>
<p>But what if I was able to find a cloud service to do my video editing? Yes, I realize there are rules of physics that might get in my way, since raw video can be huge. But just work with me.Â  What if I could meet all of my business needs with a service that runs in the cloud?</p>
<p>Would I need the Mac?Â  Would I need the Hackintosh? Would I need Premiere Pro? No, i wouldn&#8217;t.Â  A Chromebook would probably do just fine.</p>
<p>But if I went to Apple and told them my business requirements, their answer to my questions would most certainly be a MacPro. That&#8217;s what happens when you ask a hardware vendor to help solve your problem. It&#8217;s like going into a hardware store and telling him you need a place to live. The first thing they&#8217;re going to do is sell you a hammer, nails, and wood.Â  Because that&#8217;s what they sell.</p>
<h2>Why would you want hardware?</h2>

<p>This entire blog post was inspired by another blog post by a blogger and writer I respect. The title also started with &#8220;The Perils of&#8230;&#8221; He used the hammer analogy, too. He suggested that you shouldn&#8217;t go to vendors who just sell &#8220;backup,&#8221; as there is an entire continuum of data protection requirements not met by that term.Â  I agree with that part.Â  The days of backup only are over.</p>
<p>But then he suggested that his company, a very large hardware and software vendor, was the right way to go because they sell all types of solutions. That&#8217;s where I&#8217;m going to have to disagree. Because almost all of their solutions are just more hardware &amp; software.Â  Hardware &amp; software get marked up.Â  It has to be maintained. And hardware is a large capital investment.Â  Why would you want to do any of that if you could meet your data protection needs with a service where none of that is an issue?Â  Just a thought.</p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instant recovery is the modern-day equivalent of what we used to call a hot site, as it allows you to recover immediately after some type of incident. I have personally advocated for this concept, as I strongly believe that in a true disaster (or ransomware event), time is of the essence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned in my previous article, one companyâs lack of an instant recovery system caused them to pay the ransom when they were infected with ransomware. They said recovering their entire datacenter using their backup system would have taken several days, and paying the ransom would cost less than several days of downtime. I explain in the article why I completely disagree with this reasoning, but I understand I have the luxury of Monday morning quarterbacking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to being able to easily recover from a large disaster or ransomware attack is to be able to instantly spin up your entire datacenter in a hot site or an instant recovery system. This allows you to take your time addressing the cause of the incident, such as identifying and removing the ransomware itself, putting out actual fires, or replacing hardware damaged in the incident. If you can run your entire environment in a public or private cloud, you can continue your business â almost without interruption â regardless of how bad the incident is.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dedupe is not instant recoveryâs friend</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instant recovery is great, as it is allowing many to recover much quicker and better than they ever could before. Deduplication is also great, as it is the technology that enables so many wonderful things, like disk-based backup and recovery, offsite replication of backups without human intervention, and significant reductions in bandwidth usage. Itâs the marriage of deduplication and instant recovery that usually doesnât work.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deduplication systems are very good at many things, but usually are not very good at random reads and writes. Just ask anyone who has attempted to run one or more VMs using their deduplicated backup data as the datastore. The performance might be enough to handle a single server that doesnât require a lot of random I/O, but running several servers or an entire datacenter simply isn&#8217;t possible from a deduplicated datastore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why post-process deduplication backup appliances make such a big deal about their native landing zone where recent backups are stored in their native, non-deduplicated format before they are deduplicated for replication or long-term storage. They advise customers who are interested in instant recovery to turn off any backup software dedupe. Â Backups are sent to disk in their full, native format and are stored that way in the landing zone until they are pushed out by newer backups. This yields much better performance if you have to run multiple VMs from your backups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But most people using the instant recovery feature tend to be using modern backup packages that already have deduplication integrated as a core part of their product. This means they are typically performing their instant recovery using a deduplicated datastore. This means that they should be able to recover one or two VMs at a time. However, they will probably be very disappointed if they try to recover their entire datacenter.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other ways to do instant recovery</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are going to use instant recovery to run your entire datacenter in a disaster, the latest copy of your VM backups needs to be in native format on storage that can support the performance that you need. There are a couple of ways of accomplishing that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuous data protection (CDP) products are essentially replication with a back button. Some of these companies describe themselves as a TiVo for your backups. They store your backups in native format, and also store the bits needed to be able to change portions of the latest version in order to move it back in time. (A good example of such a product would be Zerto.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These types of products tend to do well at disaster recovery, but not at operational recovery. They&#8217;re good at recovering an entire datacenter, usually not so good at recovering a single file. Â The DR functionality of these products can be quite advanced, as it is their specialty. Another upside of this approach is you only have to pay for one copy of your backup â plus the versioning blocks of course. One downside to this approach is most people also purchase another product for operational recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, you can use a backup product that uses its backups to update an image stored in native format as a DR image. Â (Druva offers this as part of their Data Protection as a Service offering.) Instant recoveries â especially large scale recoveries of an entire datacenter â would run from this DR image. The advantage of this approach is you get operational recovery and disaster recovery in a single system. This is both simpler and less expensive than maintaining two systems. One disadvantage is that you will need to pay for the storage the DR copy of your data uses, equivalent to one full backup. Â This cost is offset by the fact that you would be able to do both operational recovery and disaster recovery with a single product.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donât pay ransoms! Get a better backup product!</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I mentioned in my previous blog post, please prepare now to be able to recover from a ransomware attack or other disaster. Investigate the DR plans of your company, as you might need to activate them for something you might not consider a disaster. Your entire datacenter may be fully functional, but you wonât be able to get to your data if itâs all encrypted. Â So make sure you have a solid plan for how you would recover from this scenario, because the likelihood that this will happen to your company goes up every day.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don&#8217;t negotiate with terrorists, and you don&#8217;t pay ransom unless you have no other choice. Even then, you should try every available avenue before you decide to pay money to the company holding your data for ransom. Â Itâs just a bad idea. Last week there was a news story of a company that paid several BitCoin (each of which was worth roughly $15K) to get their data back. (I am not putting the exact amount or link to the story for reasons I will explain later.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This kind of thing has become all too common, but this time things were a little bit different. The company disclosed that they had backups of the data that they could have used to restore their environment without paying the ransom. They chose to pay the ransom because they felt that it would restore their data quicker then their backup system would be able to do. I have two observations here: that was a really bad idea, and they should have had a better backup system.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">You donât pay ransom or blackmail!</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest reason you do not pay ransom or blackmail is that it says you&#8217;re open to paying ransom or blackmail. There is absolutely nothing stopping the entity who attacked you from doing it again in a few days or weeks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just ask Alexander Hamilton. Yes, that Alexander Hamilton. He had an affair with a married woman and was subsequently blackmailed by her husband. Mr. Reynolds started out asking for small figures, amounting to a few hundred dollars in today&#8217;s money. Â But by paying a few hundred dollars, Hamilton showed that he was open to paying ransom. If he was open to paying a few hundred, he would pay a few hundred more. Reynolds came back for money several times. Â By the time the event came to a conclusion, Hamilton had paid Reynolds roughly $18,000 in today&#8217;s money. (And the affair eventually came out anyway.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By paying the BitCoins to the black hat, this company has shown that they will pay the ransom if they are attacked. What makes matters even worse is that the event was published in the news. Now everyone knows that this company will pay a ransom if they are attacked. they might as well have put a giant âHACK US!â sign on their website. (The first version of this story included the name of the hospital and a link to the story. I took it out so as not to add insult to injury.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They didnât just paint a target on their back; they painted a target on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">every</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> companies back. The more companies that pay the ransom, the more black hats will attack other companies. If we all collectively refuse to pay the ransom â after ensuring that we can recover from a ransomware attack without paying the ransom â these black hats will find some other way to make money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another reason that you do not pay ransomware companies any money is that you are dealing with unscrupulous characters, and there is no assurance that you will get your data back. I am personally aware of multiple companies who paid the ransom and got nothing.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">They need a better backup system</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The backup system must not have been designed with the business needs of the company, or it would have been able to help them recover from this attack without paying the ransom. According to the story, the company felt that restoring from a backup would take too long, and paying the ransom would be quicker. What this tells me is that the recovery expectation was nowhere near the recovery reality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This company must have done a cost-benefit analysis on the cost of a few days of downtime, and decided that the amount of lost revenue was much greater than the cost of paying the ransom. Let&#8217;s say, for example, they calculated that everyday of downtime would lose them one million dollars. If they used their backup system to restore their data center, they would lose more than three million dollars, since they said it would take 2-3 days. $55,000 is peanuts when compared to three million, so they paid the ransom. I do not agree with this logic, as I discussed previously in this article. Â But this is the logic they apparently used.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they knew that their company would lose a million dollars a day, then they should have designed their backup or disaster recovery system to be able to recover in less than a day. Technology certainly exists that is capable of doing that, and it usually costs far less than the amount of money that would be lost in an outage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if the system cost similar to the amount of money that would be lost in an outage, it still might make sense to buy such a system. The reason for this is the impacts to the business go beyond a straight loss of revenue due to downtime. If your business suffers a sustained outage, you may lose more business than just the business you lost while you were down. You might lose some customers for good, and the lost revenue from that would be difficult to calculate.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being ready for a disaster</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If minimizing downtime is the key, the only way to truly be ready for a disaster is to be able to boot instantly after an outage. There are a variety of products that advertise such functionality today, but very few of them would be able to recover an entire datacenter instantly. I will discuss the various instant recovery options in my next blog post.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, I just want to remind you of two things: be ready for ransomware, and never pay the ransom. Make sure you are able to recover all of your critical data in a time frame that your business would find acceptable, so that you can tell any ransomware black hats to go pound sand if they come knocking on your door. </span></p>

			<p>Your backup server might be the biggest vulnerability in your datacenter, as I already discussed in my <a href="http://www.backupcentral.com/your-onsite-backup-server-is-a-security-risk/">previous blog post</a>.

<p>This includes bare-metal Linux &amp; Windows servers, and backup servers running in VMs in the cloud. You need to find the appropriate patches for your backup server&#8217;s OS, test them, andÂ install them.Â  Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://blog.barkly.com/meltdown-spectre-patches-list-windows-update-help">good list of those patches</a>. I&#8217;m guessing you probably don&#8217;t have the time to test them to see what kind of performance impact they might have on your backup system.</p>
<p>Reports of the performance impact of various patches include everything from &#8220;no noticeable impact&#8221; to &#8220;50% performance loss.&#8221;Â  Unfortunately for you, it seems that the more I/O intensive your workload, the greater the impact on performance. So you might install (or have installed) the patches and then run/ran your next set of backups &#8212; only to find out that they don&#8217;t complete anywhere nearly as fast as they used to.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s the case for you, then you&#8217;re having to figure out how to respond to this performance loss. If your backup server is running in a VM, you might be able to just upgrade to a bigger VM.Â  You&#8217;ll have a little downtime, but that&#8217;s a small price to pay.</p>
<p>If you have a bare metal server, which is far more likely, you might find yourself in a situation of needing to do an emergency upgrade to the backup server.Â  Some systems run in a cluster and can be scaled by just buying another node in the cluster, but others will require a forklift upgrade of the backup server.Â  Either way, you may be looking at an emergency order of a new server or two. In short, you might be having a very difficult week.Â  It&#8217;s a good week to be a server vendor, though.</p>
<h2>Virtualized Backup Server</h2>
<p>If your backup server is running inside a VM, you&#8217;ve had even more interesting week. In addition to everything mentioned above, you also need to deal with microcode updates from VMware or Microsoft.</p>
<p>VMware got a lot of credit for responding to Spectre/Meltdown very quickly, as they issued patched pretty quickly. Unfortunately, the patches were apparently causing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7qjnfx/vmware_pulled_spectre_patches_on_friday/">spontaneous reboots</a>, so they pulled them almost as fast. Check out <a href="https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/52345">this page</a> for the latest info on this.</p>

<p>Once these patches are available again, you&#8217;ll need to test and install them. And, of course, you will also need to patch the guest operating systems just as you would if they were bare metal.</p>
<p>Hyper-V customers need to do the same thing.Â  Here&#8217;s the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4072698/windows-server-guidance-to-protect-against-the-speculative-execution">latest information from them</a>.</p>
<p>The performance impact of these patches is no more known than the performance impact of the previously mentioned OS patches. Which means you might find yourself having to upgrade the underlying hardware, or at the very least increasing the power of any VMs to compensate for the performance loss.Â  Again, it&#8217;s a good week to sell servers, not such a good week for those buying them.</p>

<p>If you are using a cloud-native backup <em>service</em>, you don&#8217;t have to do anything.Â  A cloud native service means you are not responsible for the VMs offering such a service. Those VMs are not your problem.Â  The most you might want to do is contact your backup service vendor and ask them if they have patched their systems to address any vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>When the backup service installs the appropriate patches in the backend, there might indeed be an impact to the performance of each VM. But if it&#8217;s a scalable cloud service, it should be able to easily compensate for any performance loss by adding additional compute resources.Â  This should not be something you should have to worry about.</p>
<h2>Cloud means never having to say you&#8217;re sorry</h2>
<p>A true cloud service should not require you to have to worry about the infrastructure.Â  (Which is why I feel the word &#8220;cloud&#8221; <em>does</em> mean something, <a href="https://twitter.com/paulrteich/status/951515781954719745">@mattwbaker</a>.) There are other backup systems out there that are actually quite good â but they&#8217;re not cloud native. If your backup app requires you to create VMs in the cloud to install your backup server software in, they&#8217;re not really a cloud app.Â  They&#8217;re cloud washing. (Honestly, taking a product designed for physical nodes in a datacenter and installing it in VMs in the cloud is a perfect example of how <em>not</em> to use the cloud.)</p>
<p>If your backup service is actually a cloud backup service, you should not have to worry about the security of your backup system â it should be automatically taken care of.Â  If you&#8217;re having to take care of it, perhaps you should consider a different system.</p>

			<p>Did you know there have been <a href="https://www.privacyrights.org/data-breaches">7870 public data breaches</a> since 2005?Â  Your company&#8217;s data is under attack. Like terrorism, the attackers only have to be successful once. You have to be successful 100% of the time.</p>
<p>Which is why its important to patch your systems regularly and keep abreast of any security vulnerabilities your company&#8217;s backup product may have.Â  But have you ever thought about how much of a security risk the backup server is? It&#8217;s a risk for three reasons: the value of what it has, the typical experience level of its admins, and lack of attention.</p>
<h2>The backup system has all the marbles</h2>
<p>Did you ever think about the fact that the backup system is the most sensitive server in your environment? It&#8217;s sensitive because it has everything <em>and</em> it can do everything.</p>
<p>First, the backup system has a copy of everything! All the data in your environment resides on disks or tapes it controls. While some data may be stored offsite and is effectively out of reach, most current data is immediately available via a few simple commands. Sometimes the backup data is available via other mechanisms, such as a web or NFS server, which is why a vulnerability in those products could give a malicious user access to anything he/she wants.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">The backup system can read and write every piece of data in your datacenter. In order to backup data, it must be able to read it.Â  To be able to read it, the backup system is given superuser privileges.Â  Unix/Linux backup software runs as root, and Windows systems tend to run as Administrator. That means it can read or write any file in the environment.</span></p>
<p>Most backup software also has the ability to run scripts before and after the backup, and those scripts run as the privileged user. Combine that with the ability to backup and restore files, and you have a scary situation.Â  A malicious user that gains backup admin privileges can write a malicious script, back it up, restore it to the appropriate location, then execute the script using a privileged user.Â  Just let that sink in for a minute.</p>
<h2>The backup admins are often very junior</h2>
<p>My first job in tech was the &#8220;backup guy&#8221; for a huge credit card company. I barely knew how to <em>spell</em> Unix, and a few days into my job I was given the keys to the kingdom: the root password to the backup system and every server in the datacenter.Â  (We didn&#8217;t have the concept of role-based admin in those days, so anything you did with backups, you did as root.)</p>
<p>My story is not unique.Â  Backups are often given to the FNG. He or she takes the gig because it gets them the job, but it&#8217;s the job that nobody wants. As soon as you get some experience under your belt, they do their best to pass off this very difficult job to anyone else.Â  This has been true of backups for years, and this revolving door usually results in very junior people running the backup system.</p>
<p>I know I wanted to get out of backups back then, but I went from being the backup guy to being in charge of the backup team.Â  Three years later, I was still the main point of contact for the backup system.Â  Working for me were several people who were just as junior as I was when I started, all of whom had root privileges to the entire bank. Without going into details, I&#8217;ll just say that not everyone that worked for me should have been givenÂ the keys to the kingdom like that.</p>
<p>The most sensitive system in your environment is being handed over to the most junior person you have.Â  Again&#8230; let that sink in a little bit.</p>
<h2>The backup server doesn&#8217;t receive enough attention</h2>
<p>The security team always made sure the database servers &amp; file servers were patched. But I don&#8217;t recall ever getting a call from them about the backup server. That meant it was up to the most junior person in the environment to make sure the most sensitive server in the environment was being regularly patched and secured against attacks.Â  That makes perfect sense. Not.</p>
<p>Another way this manifests itself is in the backup software. Many companies making backup products rely on external products (e.g. Apache) to augment their functionality (e.g. web access to your backup server). The thinking is to use publicly available tools instead of building their own. They&#8217;re a backup company, after all, not a web server company.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, embedded software like this often gets patched later than it should.Â  When an Apache vulnerability is discovered, people who know they are running Apache tend to patch it.Â  But what if it&#8217;s inside your backup software?Â  You rely on the backup vendor to know that and to patch it appropriately. But the inattention I&#8217;m referring to also sometimes applies to embedded components inside a backup system. It make take weeks or months before the vulnerability is patched in the backup software. This <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/01/emc-vmware-security-bugs-throw-gasoline-on-cloud-security-fire/?comments=1&amp;start=40">ArsTechnica article</a> discusses a recently patched vulnerability in a backup software package where there was a three month delay between the initial discovery of the vulnerability and the creation of a patch for all related systems.</p>
<h2>Choice 1: Secure your onsite backup system</h2>
<p>You can do a number of things to secure your onsite system, starting with recognizing how much of a vulnerability it is. You can harden the system itself, patch the backup system, and do your best to limit the powers of your backup admin.</p>
<p>Harden the backup system</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Firewall it off, using a software firewall running in the system or an actual firewall in front of the system &#8212; preferably the latter. Make it so that you can only administer the system via a particular VPN, and that admins must authenticate to the VPN prior to administering the backup system. This also addresses another vulnerability, which is that some backup systems send their commands in plain text.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Make sure that the backup server is running the most secure version of the operating system you have.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Run the backup software via a separate privileged account, not <em>the</em> privileged account.Â  Run it with an account called backupadmin with userid 0, or with Administrator privileges.Â  Do not run it as root or Admininistrator.Â  Then use your ITD software to watch that account like a hawk.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If your backup admin needs root privileges on Unix systems, force them to use sudo.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Require Windows backup admins to use their non-privileged account, and &#8220;Run as administrator&#8221; when they need to do something special.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Make sure the backup system is continually updated to the latest patch level. It should be the first system you patch, not the last.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If your backup software supports two-factor authentication, use it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you are writing backup data to a deduplication appliance across Ethernet, you need to harden and separate that interface as well. For example, do not allow direct access to any of its data via NFS/SMB. A physically separate Ethernet connection between the backup server and any backup storage would be preferred.</p>
<p>Limit backup admin powers</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If your backup system supports the concept or role-based admin, do whatever you can to limit the power of the backup admin.Â  Maybe give them the power to do backups but not restores.Â  Or they can run backups, but not configure backups.Â  Restores and configuration changes could/should be done by a separate account that requires a separate login with strong two-factor authentication.</p>
<h2>Choice 2: Get rid ofÂ  your backup server</h2>
<p>What if you got rid of your backup server altogether?Â  There&#8217;s nothing more secure than something that doesn&#8217;t exist!Â  You could do this by using a backup system with a service-based public cloud architecture. Backup services that backup directly to the cloud offer a number of security advantages over those that use backup servers.</p>
<p>Front end designed for direct Internet access</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Traditional backup systems are designed to be run inside an already-secure datacenter, where there is an expectation that direct attacks will be lower. Cloud backup systems are designed with harder front ends because they acknowledge they will be directly connected to the Internet. A lot of the basic security changes suggested above would be considered table stakes to any Internet-facing service.</p>
<p>Continuous security monitoring</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Backup services run in a cloud like AWS are continually monitored for attempted intrusion.Â  (Again, this is table stakes for such a service.)Â  You get best of breed security simply by using the service.</p>
<p>Any embedded systems constantly &amp; automatically patched</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The operating systems and applications supporting any backup service are automatically and immediately patched to the latest available patches. The infrastructure is so huge that this has to be automated; you don&#8217;t have to do anything to make it happen.</p>
<p>Backup data not exposed to anyone</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A good cloud backup system also segregates your actual backup data from the rest of the network, just like I was suggesting for your onsite backup server. But in this case, that&#8217;s already one. No one is getting to your backup data except through the authorized backup system.</p>
<h2>Summary: Lock it up or give it up</h2>
<p>Once you recognize what an incredibly vulnerable thing your backup server is, your choices are simple: lock it up very tight or get rid of it. I think most companies would be served well by the latter.Â  Given the advent of <a href="http://www.backupcentral.com/why-good-dedupe-is-important-and-hard-to-do/">really good dedupe</a> and replication, only the biggest companies are not able to take cloud-based backup systems.</p>

I am now Chief Technical Architect at <a href="http://www.druva.com">Druva</a>, the leading provider of cloud-based data protection and data management tools for endpoints, infrastructure, and cloud applications.  These posts reflect my own opinion and are not necessarily the opinion of my employer.  </p>					</div><!-- .entry-content -->
