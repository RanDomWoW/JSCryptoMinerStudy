                     Functioning of restructuring cell of BSNL corporate office New Delhi It is a big fun that the restructuring cell of BSNL corporate office has notified to hold meeting of PLI on 09-03-2018 as per decision taken in the last meeting held on 15-02-2018, and it is confirmed on 07-03-2018. But we surprised to see that as per letter No.-1-5/2018/Restg, dt-08-03-2018. The notified meeting is postponed.</br> 

This practice is viewed regularly at the part of restructuring cell in corporate office. We strongly oppose such type of irresponsible functioning of the restructuring cell. We hope higher management in BSNL corporate office will take note of it. If it happens like this who will monitor the functioning of field units.

A meeting is held at the Sanchar Bhawan today the 24.02.2018, between Shri Manoj Sinha, Hon’ble Minister of State for Communications and the All Unions and Associations of BSNL. Together with the Minister, Secretary, DoT, Special Secretary, DoT, Joint Secretary (Admn.), DoT, OSD to the Hon’ble Minister, CMD BSNL and Director (HR) BSNL were present. From the All Unions and Associations of BSNL, Com. P. Abhimanyu, GS, Com. Chandeswar Singh, GS, NFTE, Com. K. Sebastin, GS, SNEA, Com. Prahlad Rai, GS, AIBSNLEA, Com. K. Jayaprakash, GS, FNTO, Com. N.D. Ram, GS, SEWA BSNL, Com. Ravi Shil Verma, GS, AIGETOA, Com. Mallikarjuna, President, BSNL MS and Com. S.D. Sharma, GS, BSNL ATM, participated in the discussions. The representatives of the AUAB heartily thanked the Hon’ble Minister for taking out time to meet them. Detailed discussions took place on the memorandum submitted to the Hon’ble Minister, the details of which are as follows:-</br>

(1)	3rd Pay Revision.</br>
So far, the DoT has been maintaining that BSNL employees are not eligible for 3rd Pay Revision. In today’s meeting the Hon’ble Minister agreed that the issue of 3rd Pay Revision of BSNL employees would be processed and would be taken for the approval of the DPE and the Cabinet. This is a great achievement. We have broken the stalemate that prevailed in the Pay Revision issue. At the same time we have to be vigilant, till the final approval is given by the Cabinet.</br>

(2)	Formation of Subsidiary Tower Company.</br>
The AUAB representatives expressed their apprehension that in the name of formation of the Tower Company, the 66,000 mobile towers of BSNL are being snatched away from BSNL. They also pointed out that the decision of the Cabinet that, the Subsidiary Tower Company would remain under the control of BSNL Management, has been violated, through the appointment of an IAS officer as the CMD of Subsidiary Tower Company. They further pointed out that even BSNL Management was not taken in to confidence in the appointment of an IAS officer as the CMD of the Subsidiary Tower Company, which clearly shows that the Subsidiary Tower Company would not be under the control of BSNL Management. The reply given by the Hon’ble Minister in this regard is not satisfactory. The AUAB has to find ways and means to ensure the rolling back of the Subsidiary Tower Company.</br>

(3)	Pension Revision.</br>
The representatives of AUAB strongly argued that pension revision should be done to the BSNL pensioners. It was pointed out that the BSNL pensioners and the Central Government pensioners are covered by the same rules. They argued that when pension revision is settled for the Central Government pensioners, the same should not be denied to the BSNL pensioners. The Hon’ble Minister assured that needful action would be taken to settle this issue.  </br>

(4)	Calculation of Pension Contribution.</br>
It was strongly argued that pension contribution in respect of BSNL employees cannot be calculated on the basis of maximum of the pay scale, when the same is calculated on the basis of actual basic pay, in the case of Central Government employees. It was pointed out that as per the DoP&T order issued in 2006, pension contribution of the Central Government employees is being deducted on the basis of actual pay only. The Hon’ble Minister directed the Secretary, DoT, that this issue should be settled as per Government orders.</br>

(5)	Allotment of 4G spectrum to BSNL.</br>
The AUAB representatives pointed out that it will be extremely difficult for BSNL to compete with the private operators, without providing 4G service. They strongly argued that the proposal of the BSNL Management, for the allotment of 4G spectrum by the Government, should be accepted. The Hon’ble Minister replied in the positive and assured that needful action would be taken.</br>

(6)	Reduction of retirement age from 60 to 58.</br>
The AUAB representatives strongly argued that the retirement age of the BSNL employees should not be reduced from 60 to 58, as a measure for the revival of BSNL. The Hon’ble Minister told that the government is not having any proposal to reduce the retirement age from 60 to 58.</br>

(7)	Left out issues of the 2nd PRC.</br>
The AUAB representatives pointed out that this issue is lingering on very long time and needs to be settled. The Hon’ble Minister stated that this issue would be looked into by the Secretary, DoT.</br>

At the end of the meeting, the Hon’ble Minister stated that the representatives of AUAB could meet him again, as well as the Secretary, DoT, in continuation of today’s meeting. The representatives of AUAB heartily thanked the Minister for his positive response to most of the issues. </br>

After the meeting with the Hon’ble Minister, a meeting of the AUAB was held in the FNTO’s office. All the General Secretaries expressed their satisfaction with regards to the progress in the issues. They also expressed the view that all these have happened only because of the united struggles and massive mobilisations by the entire Non-Executives and Executives, for which they deserve appreciation. </br>

DoT vide letter number 24-1/2018/SR communicated CMD, BSNL with respect to the agitation notice by All Unions and Associations of BSNL - Massive March to Sanchar Bhawan on 23.02.2018. Through this letter DoT has apprised the status of demands wherein all the demands have been denied which is the most frustrating situation. DoT instead of settling the issues in the interest of BSNL's viability and its employees denying the settlement of the legitimate demands. The reply of the DoT only shows it’s high handedness as well as anti-BSNL stand.

As per the call of the All Unions and Associations of BSNL, the employees of BSNL are observing ‘Work According to Rule’ from 30.01.2018. This struggle was reviewed in the meeting of All Unions and Associations of BSNL, held yesterday the 06.02.2018, as well as in the Steering Committee meeting held today. After detailed discussion, it has been decided to observe Non-cooperation to NOFN and other government projects.

The All Unions and Associations of BSNL is writing to the Secretary, DoT and to the CMD BSNL, about the struggle of Non-cooperation to NOFN and other government projects.</br>
As a part of the ongoing ‘Work According to Rule’ programme, Non-Executives and Executives are requested to perform their duties strictly according to rules.

CMD BSNL convened a meeting of the members of steering committee of All Unions and Associations of BSNL. He apprised that BSNL’s net worth is about 35,000 Crore. The operational profit of BSNL last year was about 4000 Crore that was significant to other private operator. The EBITDA of BSNL was positive of Rs. 1684 Crore. BSNL’s asset reserves is Rs. 91684 Crore, land value is about 789 Crore. The loss of BSNL has gone down. BSNL is having only 4200 Crore’s loan which is insignificant comparison other Telecom Operators. In view of this BSNL is a very strong organization, neither SICK nor incipient SICK.<br/>

 
CMD further mentioned that 4G spectrum and technology is a must in BSNL for the public perception and its requirement. In view of that BSNL Board has already taken a decision in its last Board meeting held on 21.12.2017 to get allocated 4G spectrum from DoT and DPR has been sent to DoT for approval. BSNL needs to pay Rs. 16000 Crore to get allocated 4G spectrum from DoT for next 10 years. BSNL has decided to launch 4G mobile service on 31st January 2018 by improving its existing mobile network in some of the Circles. After allocation of 4G spectrum from DoT, the 4G service will be rolled out throughout the county. We have requested DoT to utilize 5000 Crore remaining equity of BSNL in allocation of the 4G spectrum. Rs. 17500 Crore was Govt. equity in BSNL at the time its formation. Out of which equity of about Rs. 12500 Crore has already been utilized. 50% spectrum charges can be adjusted against equity and remaining amount will be paid in 10 installment in 10 years. In this manner BSNL is trying to get 4G allocation from DoT at the earliest. <br/>

Also discussed the issue of cancellation of the free calling from landlines on Sundays, as well as change in the timing of the night free calling. <br/>

On the issue of creation of Tower Subsidiary, CMD mentioned that in case the Tower Subsidiary 100% control remains with BSNL than it is beneficial to BSNL otherwise it may not be beneficial. The appointment of CMD Tower Subsidiary Company has been decided by DoT which was not in his notice. All the representatives expressed their resentment against the creation of Tower Subsidiary.<br/>

Regarding wage revision , we expressed our serious concern against delay in constituting bilateral committee for Non Executive employees. We explained that revision of pay of BSNL employees is a must to keep them motivated and in the interest of BSNL’s viability.

 DOT vide its letter no.79-51/2017 -SU dated 21.12.2017, has appointed Shri Amit Yadav (IAS) ,Joint Secretary (Admin), DOT as CMD of tower subsidiary company of BSNL. It is surprising that as per Union Cabinet decision the tower subsidiary will be fully owned by BSNL , but after seeing the DOT order it is difficult to understand that whether tower subsidiary will be controlled directly by DOT or through BSNL. We strongly oppose such active move of Government to fragment BSNL assets.

Amit Yadav IAS officer has been appointed as CMD of Tower Company (so called subsidiary of BSNL). It is a calculated move to dismantle BSNL by taking away vital and potential earning assets- towers- of BSNL. It is surely a sinister and deadly move to disintegrate BSNL and facilitate other service providers to these towers of BSNL to enable them deeper penetration in wireless segment without any capital investment. BSNL has made incredible capital investment in building mobile tower infrastructure which is its greatest strength as of now. <br>

It is not going to end here- very shortly govt. will go ahead with creation of land assets Company by taking away premier and highly potential land assets of BSNL throughout Country and allow Private entrepreneurs to build commercial complexes on this gold mine of BSNL. <br>

If this is allowed to continue, in due course of time, BSNL will be consigned to flames and get buried deep down the ground. <br>

Comrades you understand the grave seriousness of the situation and the immediate massive organisational response that is needed to force the govt. to reverse its decision of creating subsidiary tower Company which is fraught with deadly consequences. If we do not act and succeed now, then we have to forget about BSNL.

(1) Revamping of committee for 3rd pay revision of non-executive employees:- The union demanded that the present committee be revamped and joint committee consisting of staff side and Management side be formed for bilateral discussions. The Director (HR) told that the guidelines from DPE have not been received in this respect. The union replied that there is no guideline of DPE in respect of executives also. Why management is processing for executives only. It is blanket discrimination being meted out to non-executives employees. The exercise of pay revision should commence in respect of non-executive staff akin to executives Director (HR) was convinced with the arguments and agreed that there should not be discrimination.
	(2) Concessions and facilities to disabled employees:- Union told in clear terms to Director (HR) that the services of disabled personnel can neither be dispensed with nor reduced as per DOP guidelines. The DOT has not endorsed DOP communications to BSNL HQR. The Director (HR) agreed to the union’s plea and said the DOP guidelines will be followed even if these are not endorsed to BSNL by DOT.
	(3) Filling up of resultant vacancies in the Cadre of JAO from qualified personnel at Telangana:- The issue was explained and Director (HR) responded positively in the matter.
(4) Formal meeting to union:- Union explained that at many circles and SSAs councils meeting are not taking place despite instructions from corporate office. The councils meeting cannot take place unless agenda are not received by the management at respective levels. The staff grievances are not being redressed on account of this. In this situation orders be issued for grant of formal meeting at the places where councils meetings are not taking place.
	Director (HR) agreed to get the matter considered.

C. Singh G.S. along with GS of BSNLEU, GS AIBSNLEA and GS SNEA has attended the meeting convened by CMD BSNL today at 1530 hrs to discuss the present condition of BSNL. CMD apprised about the Indian Mobile congress (IMC) on 25-26 September 2017 at Pragati Maidan wherein many private operators CEOs visited BSNL . Best stall there is of BSNL. Current market scenario CMD informed that positive side for BSNL is that the market share of BSNL has increased from 8.6 in March,2017 to 8.84 in July 2017 in mobile segment despite of tough competition. Media has also reported that BSNL has challenge the Reliance Jio in the ongoing tariff war. Whole credit goes to the BSNL employees and we are proud of it. However BSNL has suffered on financial front. Revenue in July impacted huge due to GST implementation. In the month of Aug the realisation was 98.9% and in September till date 55%. Due to this cash crunch in the month of July the salary was disbursed on OD. Earlier IUC charges benchmark was 0.14 paisa which is now reduce to 0.6 paisa. In our opinion it should be minimum 0.22 paisa. Now BSNL has to launch aggressive tariffs in view of this BSNL in collaboration with micromax is launching bundled feature phone having Smartphone features on the price of Rs 2,200 and Rupees 97 sim with unlimited voice and Data. It will be matching brand with Jio. This product will save customers in rural and medium class. BSNL is subsidising Rs 1200 out of 2200 and this product will be named Bharat-1. BSNL has also tied up with Vodafone on prepaid service for free roaming now customer of BSNL may roam on Vodafone network freely . post-paid will also take place soon. Recently BSNL has received Rs 1500 crores from NFS amount which will help immediately. Further any suggestion may be given by unions and association within one week time in this regard. BSNL has also applied for 4G spectrum allocation (2100 MHz band) which will cater 3G also. The spectrum charges will be paid on yearly basis up to ten years. 2G phase VIII order need to be reviewed. 3rd PRC implementation in BSNL with 15 % fitment benefit: CMD informed that BSNL MC has approved the 3rd PRC report with 15% fitment benefit and it has been sent to DOT for clearance. Simultaneously it will be placed in the next Board meeting for approval shortly.

(i)	Imposing  CRS to an employee due to lost in vision while in service – Case of   M.P. circle. 
In this regard the Director(HR) instructed the GM(SR), C.O. New Delhi to intervene immediately to search out the legal and administrative position in the matter. The leaders submitted that the notice has been served on 14-09-2017 for compulsory retirement of the employee with effect from 30-09-2017. Which is not proper and the issue should be resolved in light of Supreme Court order as well as in light of PWD act. The Director(HR) reciprocated positively and assured extension of justice in the matter.
(ii)	Payment of PLI to the staff working in “TERM CELL” at Raipur (CG), in this issue of payment of PLI to 3 employees who are posted in “TERM Cell” at Raipur and getting salaries from BSNL, due to the indifferent attitude of establishment as well as restructuring section the issue is still pending. We recalled the version of the Director(HR) of 18-08-2017, where the Director (HR) instructed the GM(SR) to arrange to issue order for the payment. Director (HR) told that the file did not come with proper noting.
(iii)	The leaders invited the Director(HR) and requested to address the NEC scheduled to be held on 12th & 13th October, 2017 at Vijayawada. Madam assured to spare time on 13th October, 2017.

	In this connection we may clarify that the CHQ has done a lot in this matter before it was taken as an agenda in National council. We are aware that the same issue was discussed by the SEWA (BSNL) in their three periodical meetings with management. We are glad that the issue has been resolved and several SC/ST candidates have got benefit. SEWA (BSNL) is our alliance partner and it is our joint achievement. NFTE has always played a vital role to protect the interest of SC/ST employees and due to this, the SEWA (BSNL) has joined hand with NFTE. Dear Comrades, NFTE is never run for undue credit but works hard to protect the interest of employees.

Some Comrades went to Court against this and Hon’ble Court has directed the BSNL management to grant upgradation to such regularized officials who were granted TSM on or before 01-10-2000 and regularized after formation of BSNL only from 01-10-2004 as it is done for other observed employees. On this verdict of Hon’ble Court the officials who were went to the Court got their upgradation revised with retrospective effect, now the management wants to extend it for others. (This issue was raised in Nation Council). This issue was discussed in BSNL management committee and the committee has directed the establishment branch to seek views of recognized unions in the matter as the management wants to implement this award of Court but they want to give it with prospective effect that is the pay fixation will be done notionally w.e.f. 01-10-2004 but the actual benefit will be from the date of approval of BSNL Board of this issue. Kindly send your suggestions within a week time to enable CHQ to take a decision in this regard and to convey, it to BSNL management by 18-08-2017.

Dear Comrade, as you are well aware of the fact that, the National Forum of BSNL Unions and Associations has taken initiative for settling the issue of 3rd PRC by holding its 1st meeting on 24th May 2017 and calling their members to hold the lunch hour demonstration all over Nation on 14th June 2017 and relay hunger fast on 3rd and 4th July 2017.  Simultaneously we have written series of letters to PMO, Secretary DOT and DPE including Minister of heavy industries. At the same time BSNL management including CMD himself met Minister of IT and Communication to secure 3rd PRC for their work force. 
Now based on Cabinet approval the DPE notification has to be seen that whether the Administrative Ministry/Board of the PSUs have been empowered by the Cabinet to allow dispension of the “Affordability Clause" of 3rd PRC report. In case Board/Administrative Ministry is empowered then BSNL Board and DOT Administration should implement the 3rd PRC in BSNL in the interest of its Viability otherwise, we have to fight organisationally.
National Forum of BSNL unions/associations are committed for 3rd PRC implementation and in case the BSNL Board/DOT Administration do not implement it, in that case national forum of BSNL unions and association will never hesitate to go on indefinite Strike as decided in 4th July 2017 meeting.  
	After taking the stock of the situation an emergent meeting of National Forum of BSNL unions/association met today in Delhi under the Chairmanship of Com. V. Subburaman G.S. TEPU and decided to hold Lunch Hour Demonstration on 26-07-2017 at all levels for securing 3rd PRC to BSNL employees. And also decided to wear the black badges, while on duty on 27-07-2017 to extend moral support and focus our demand. – C. Singh, Convener National Forum of BSNL unions/associations.

The employees are making frequent and anxious enquires about their 3rd Pay revision. The guidelines of DPE and DOT for wage revision are still awaited by BSNL. The union has sought the intervention of honorable Prime Minister for early issuance of guidelines and it is moving step by step on the vital issue. 
The employees need not be alarmed over the situation but should remain watchful. Undoubtedly big challenge is before us. The NFTE is committed to ensure wage revision as in the case of PLI. We will not leave any stone unturned to secure 3rd wage revision for the BSNL Staff  .
Keep on educating and mobilising the workers to thwart attempt of any mischief. BSNL management has already taken responsibility  to find out the resources to meet the expenditures of the pay Revision.
