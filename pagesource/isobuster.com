Thanks. Your product help me out A LOT when I had a deadline and the disk I used became corrupt. Your product was a life saver!</p> <p class="italic blue">Malcolm McNair, Valparaiso, Florida, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>Thank you so much! IsoBuster was the only application that worked!!! I tested maybe 5 or so other programs to get my files out of a damaged dvdr and only ISOBuster was able to retrieve them!!!! I'm so happy. Awesome software and well worth the purchase.</p> <p class="italic blue">Jay Padua, Makati, Philippines</p> </li> <li> <p>Just wanted to say THANK YOU! I was able to rescue home video from 2 very damaged DVD-R's that appeared unreadable to every device I tried them in.  IsoBuster was able to salvage 99% of what was on them.</p> <p class="italic blue">Amy Bellows, North Richland Hills, Texas, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>I just wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart for this program. Tonight I lost all of the videos and pictures from my son's first three months of life that I had saved on a DVD. I was crying like I had lost a family member. I was a mess and my husband was beside himself. I tried a few of the free programs and was getting nowhere. Isobuster found the files in seconds and the $39.95 I paid to extract the files to my computer was worth every penny. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU !!!! </p> <p class="italic blue">Jennifer Loudin, Pennsylvania, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>After a morning of tears when I realised a disc full of my daughters baby photos wasn't working, I found your site. I used the trial to make sure it worked (so many free recovery programs didn't) and yep yours did so without hesitation I bought the license. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU for having a wonderful program that gave me back my precious memories. I think that will be the best $ spent this year!</p> <p class="italic blue">Carley Cain, Southport BC, QLD, Australia</p> </li> <li> <p>I just wanted to say how much I appreciate your program. I was able to recover files that I thought were gone forever because other programs could not recover them. Your program recovered over 3gb of files on a DVD, over three years of Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, Access databases, and Adobe Acrobat files. Thank you for creating and maintaining this software it is wonderful. Keep up the good work and I will continue to upgrade the software because it is so valuable and priced reasonably. Yes, I did upgrade to your newest version as soon as I saw an email from you announcing the upgrade. Thank you again and keep up the good work, your program works as advertised and more than expected.</p> <p class="italic blue">Jim Specht, Stockbridge, Georgia, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>I record family video footage from my camera on to DVD. I have had two DVDs which gave me the message 'disc error' as I came to finalise them and were no longer playable not even on the recorder they had been created on. They couldn't be read by a PC either. As these contained footage which had been gathered over a long period of time the original was no longer available and I thought I had lost it completely. Visits to local IT firms produced no joy and every where I went it was a case of 'sorry can't help'. I downloaded IsoBuster on Sunday as a last resort and within two hours I had successfully got the files from the corrupted discs and burnt them onto new DVDs. Many thanks for a great program.</p> <p class="italic blue">John Baxter, Andover, Hampshire, UK</p> </li> <li> <p>I just wanted to start by saying THANK YOU SO MUCH for your program. I lost pictures extremely important to me, it turns out they were on a DVD that did not finalize properly. With your program I was able to recover every picture (multiple different formats)with no problems. This program is as easy as 1 2 3 to use. Thanks again, you have relieved so much of my stress. I will recommend this program to everyone and post on my facebook.</p> <p class="italic blue">Shelly Ganger, Mishawaka, Indiana, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>I have just downloaded you product as I had a CD that the data could not be accessed, I want to say thank you, you product is great all my data is restored and usable. Thank you. I am delighted at how easy and quick it was to recover the files.</p> <p class="italic blue">Graeme Petersen, Tauranga, New Zealand</p> </li> <li> <p>The files tested as no read errors so we went ahead and purchased what I will now call a wonderful product. IsoBuster helped recover video we thought we lost. We had family visting from 1500 miles away and was depressed to think we lost footage. Thanks to IsoBuster we were able to find the VOB files which we already knew what to do with as far as editing. Thanks again for helping us recovering our family videos!</p> <p class="italic blue">Jay Perkinson &amp; Wendy Murphy, West Islip, New York, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>Would just like to message you and say how pleased I am with your software. I had corrupted dvds with footage of my daughter growing up which as you could imagine is priceless to me. Nothing I could do could retrieve the information on the dvd disks. I had virtually given up until I came across your software ISOBuster and it retrieved all the information and I now have all my footage back. I would just like to give you this feedback and also will be recommending to everyone I speak to how great your software is. Keep up the excellent work. Also thankyou for your quick response to my problem with the security key.</p> <p class="italic blue">Brett Harder, Perth, WA, Australia</p> </li> <li> <p>I have a dvd video camera and a corrupt dvd disk. It was recorded at christmas time and I was so upset at the thought I had lost these precious memories forever. Isobuster successfully read the disk and found the video files and I will be forever grateful to you for this fabulous product!!!!</p> <p class="italic blue">Tina Karlsson, Hassall Grove, NSW, Australia</p> </li> <li> <p>Your program is a lifesaver. I had mistakenly put all of my family pictures from over the years onto a CD-R disc and then deleted them from the pc. I thought they were lost to me. I purchased your software and in just a few minutes I had them all back. So easy to use!</p> <p class="italic blue">Brenda Durrington, Suffield, CT, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>I just purchased your product and it is awsome!!! I used it to recover VOB files from a DVD RW that I initialized on DVD desktop recorder. After I initialized the disc for a new project I realized that I did not make a hard copy of my home movies that were on it. I checked out some of the other CD\DVD recovery softwares but they only supported certain file formats. I needed to recover VOB (and IFO) files on an already newly initialized disc. Your software did it! Thanks for making my day! PS. This was a DVD that was initialized on a home stand alone desktop DVD recorder. The unit spent about 3 minutes initializing the DVD-RW for a new project. After this the  recorder said the disk was empty. My PC said the disc was empty. Your product brought back the files that were on the disc and they were in tact (they play)!</p> <p class="italic blue">Jeff Hirschfeld, Santa Monica, California, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>I ran it for the first time in almost year and it informed me of an update. It installed pretty much automatically and no re-registering was necessary. Great stuff. And once again it save months of work on a DVD I was making. I use a stand-alone HD/DVD recorder to save old TV shows and movies that do not exist on DVD and I don&#39;t close or finalize the DVD until it is nearly full, so a DVD may contain up to 8 hours of material. On this one it was my fault - I filled it a tad over full and the last file would not record so I knew I was in trouble. I tried to finalize it but it failed. Using your program, in about an hour I recovered all 24 "half-hour" shows, copied the VOBs over to my Mac, renamed them and Toasted them to a new DVD. All in a few hours. I really appreciate what your software can do - extracting data from a DVD that has not been finalized is quite miraculous. Thanks for the great software</p> <p class="italic blue">Gerry Dorman, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>Hello, I bought the program a few days ago. Even though I paid for it, I just wanted to tell you how much this program is appreciated. I was able to extract files from a personal "back up" DVD that had not closed properly so I could not open it with any dvd player/burner. I backed up the files before reinstalling my OS. This back up was all my photos, programs (exe), utilities, documents, etc. Irreplaceble! Thanks a lot for a great program. :)</p> <p class="italic blue">Bonnie Collins, Burbank, CA, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>Thanks to isobuster a major problem I had tried to solve for three weeks was solved immediately. I have a data base to which I add weekly and each week I copy the updated file to a cd-r using the Microsoft program. With each update I replaced the existing file on the cd. A module failure occurred which corrupted the file on the hard drive which meant the file on the cd-r was also corrupted. The file could not be opened and I was facing the prospect of reinstating my 2007 archive then inputting nearly six months of data. Fortunately it occurred to me finally that since I was using a cd-r I might be able to recover a previous good version of the file. Typing &#39;multisession&#39; into Google and going through some of the results found me IsoBuster. Downloading the free version got me my file back immediately so by way of thanks for saving me many hours of work I have today purchased Isobuster.</p> <p class="italic blue">George Harrison, Perth, Western Australia</p> </li> <li> <p>Brilliant software. Tried lots of alternatives none of which came anywhere close to IsoBuster. My camcorder completely messed up the disk but IsoBuster recovered almost all of the video. Thanks.</p> <p class="italic blue">David Ferguson, Cambridge, UK</p> </li> <li> <p>FYI - I was able to get my video from my disc! I can&#39;t believe it. I had spent three - four hours trying to get something to even recognize the disc, let alone get the information. I searched on the internet for other people who couldn&#39;t get information from a disc and someone recommended IsoBuster. It is the only program that actually found the information and now, thanks to IsoBuster, I was able to recover the video. This video was taken of two public works employees that spent all day with me while I videotaped them doing their work. I was sure the video was gone and I would have to redo the whole day. This would not have gone over well with the employer. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Great product!</p> <p class="italic blue">Ann Pudoff, Folsom, CA, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>Just wanted to say thank you so much for your wonderful product! I had a cd containing over 100 pictures which I foolishly hadn&#39;t copied anywhere else. Murphy&#39;s Law the disk got corrupted &amp; I thought that was that.... valuable pictures gone forever. I Google&#39;d the web for any solution that might be out there &amp; came across your website. Within 10 minutes of purchasing your product I had my pictures back!! Absolutely wonderful &amp; so easy to use. Highly recommend it to anyone with similiar problems.</p> <p class="italic blue">Richard O&#39;Connor, Dublin, Ireland</p> </li> <li> <p>We purchased Isobuster yesterday to recover data from two dvds that both had the same files. We make two copies of all dvds and our dvd drive could not read either one, which is rare. We searched the internet for data recovery software and looked at many programs. The ones that were totally free could not read our dvds. Isobuster read them instantly. We paid for the full version and recovered our files easily. We are very pleased with Isobuster.</p> <p class="italic blue">Mark Peterson, Peterson Aerial Photography Inc., Minnetonka, MN, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>I&#39;d just like to express my gratitude for this excellent product. I had the first year of my daughter&#39;s life (including the birth!) all stored on a DVD. When I came to finalise the disk in my recorder last week the machine broke down during the finalise. The disk became unreadable and I started to panic. I tried a number of applications which failed to recognise any data on the disk until Isobuster was recommended to me. It found the data within seconds and I was able to extract the .VOB files and reconstruct the DVD.</p> <p class="italic blue">Patrick Martin, London, UK</p> </li> <li> <p>WOW!!! What an absolute LIFE SAVER! I just reformatted my laptop&#39;s hard drive and installed my operating system from scratch. I thought I was smart, having backed up all of my document files to DVD and I even	verified that the discs worked in my dvd drive. However, after the OS reinstall, the discs appeared empty. I then tried two other machines and the discs still looked empty. I know data was burned onto them...I could even see the "burn marks" on the back of the discs. I scoured the internet for help and almost all answers pointed to faulty burns or bad discs. I amost gave up but found a reference to trying ISO Burner. Voila! It took ISO Buster all of 30 seconds to restore ALL of my missing data that NO other drive or computer could read. What an absolute Life Saver!!!! A huge thank you to Peter and ISO Buster. That was the best $39.95 I&#39;ve ever spent!</p> <p class="italic blue">Chris Martin, Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina, United States</p> </li> <li> <p>Friend had a knowledgeable "PC Doctor" back up his computer, burning a DVD of all the files covering many years of personal and business related documentation and family photographs. The photos had been gathered for a 65th birthday event for the wife. The computer was then reformatted to solve a persistent problem. Guess what... the backup DVD was unreadable in any PC. As a fairly savey PC user I had used ISOBUSTER 1.0 to solve a problem andupgraded to 2.0 in appreciation for it having saved me from a disaster with an unreadable photo archive disk. And as you would expect ISOBUSTER 2.0 saved my friend as well. I was able to recover all the data. This is a problem godsend.</p> <p class="italic blue">Patrick G Whittingham, Stouffville, Ontario , Canada</p> </li> <li> <p>This isn&#39;t a problem, it&#39;s a big THANKS! Isobuster really saved my butt last night. I know I shouldn&#39;t depend on packet-writing programs, but I&#39;ve never (before) had the slightest problem and the one I use (DLA) is so convenient....
Well, something happened somewhere with Windows Updates and now the program is crashing when I try to eject a disc, making the disc unreadable. I have this one DVD filled with tons of archival programs, updates, etc. I thought it was toast, but Isobuster retrieved EVERYTHING, even though Windows said it couldn&#39;t access the disc (and therefore the 4 GB were "empty"). I bought the program a while ago just as one of the safety tools I keep on my rig. In one night Isobuster completely paid for itself. Thanks!</p> <p class="italic blue">Christian B. Hart, Los Angeles, CA, United States</p> </li> <li> <p>I just wanted to make a comment on your product. All I can say is this. I BOW-DOWN TO THE MASTERS. Thank You for the best dang software that has ever been invented. I had HP Pavillion PC I never sealed my disc to use on another OS and by doing that My OS XP couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t read the information on the files (CD&#39;s) I knew they where there. But now thanks to ISOBuster I have every single disc back and there all readable again. All 455 family vid and Pic&#39;s disc are back and the joy of being able to see my mother again was worth every penney. I would of paid 8 times the amount I did for this program it&#39;s that Dam Good. Your Customer for Life</p> <p class="italic blue">Charles T. Werenczak, Jamestown, NY, United States</p> </li> <li> <p>We are at the beginning of a very important project with a tight time frame. Our client sent us a DVD that we needed to review and choose video clips to include in a "Walk-In" video that we are creating for their National Sales Conference. On Friday, we took the DVD, put it in our duplicator and created two copies. Much too our chagrin the copies AND the original were corrupted. After checking the discs on numerous players we got very worried. Today I downloaded your software, located the instructions and EASILY recovered the DVD. What a lifesaver!!! We can continue on schedule and won&#39;t be embarrassed by going back to the client and saying we had a problem with "the only copy" of their DVD. THANK YOU for creating a fantastic product.</p> <p class="italic blue">Peter Gordon, Kay MultiMedia, New York, NY, United States</p> </li> <li> <p>I just wanted to say that your program saved almost 1000 pictures that me and my friends took on our vacation in Florida. Thank YOU for making this awesome program!!! Regards from 4 happy Swedes...</p> <p class="italic blue">Patrick Gottlieb, Uddevalla, Sweden</p> </li> <li> <p>ISOBuster is the best. One of my users erased a DVDRW that she had family photo&#39;s on.  Using your program we were able to recover all the photos off the dvd. We found your program by doing a google search for "DVD Recovery". I will say I was skeptical about the product at first but I have no problems in saying "ISOBuster WORKS!!!" and if you need to recover a DVD or CD, stop looking and click the buy now. You can&#39;t go wrong for the price of the program.</p> <p class="italic blue">JR Williams, Senior Systems Engineering Architect, Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, United States</p> </li> <li> <p>Just wanted to say THANKS. I found your software sometime in &#39;99 then lost it in a HDD crash later that year. Anyway I just found it again and realized that this is by far the best and fastest data recovery software out there! Keep up the great work! Thanks.</p> <p class="italic blue">Steve, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>I have a cd camera and during use the cd became currupted (file error) I had a few pictures that I wouldnt be able to do again. The cd was unsable in any computer. Product worked great. Thanks for a wonderful product. You saved a few good memories on that disk. THANKS AGAIN</p> <p class="italic blue">Connie Owens, Dundee Michigan, United States</p> </li> <li> <p>Just bought IsoBuster 30 minutes ago after intensive search on the internet, trying other products that didn&#39;t work. Haven&#39;t been able to sleep for 2 days after losing important and unique pictures on a CD-RW that became unreadeable on any machine. Oh my God: you saved my life... everything came back... THANKS AGAIN! Great team, great technicians, great software...</p> <p class="italic blue">Andr&#233; Barri&#232;re, Sherbrooke (Quebec), Canada</p> </li> <li> <p>Thanks for including my suggestion of a sort option like Windows Explorer in the new IsoBuster update. I back up my data to DVD-R and DVD+R using Nero multisessions with these options: replace files with changed date or size, add new files, and remove deleted files. I name each session with the date. Windows Explorer sees only the latest versions of the files in the folders, but with IsoBuster I can go back in time to any of the preceding sessions. It&#39;s the perfect way to get old versions out. I set Nero to the UDF file system for the best compatibility with long file names and paths. With the new sort options in IsoBuster it&#39;s easy to find what I&#39;m looking for in folder and file lists. It&#39;s also great to know that if a disk should deteriorate, IsoBuster will probably read it!</p> <p class="italic blue">Ed, Eureka, California, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>Wow, Your ISO buster saved my data. I had 3.5gig of very sensitive data that I couldn&#39;t read. Months of scans and hundreds, maybe thousands of hand scanned documents. I learned a valuable lesson. BACKUP THE BACKUPS! I now have 4 duplicate copies of this data. Thanks for making this software.</p> <p class="italic blue">Scott Oberst, IA, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>Thanks for your quick assistance and a great program. I can&#39;t tell you how many clients that I have who use UDF packet writing software who can&#39;t seem to close out their disks. No matter how many times I explain it, they never seem to be able to do it. Your program is a life saver....</p> <p class="italic blue">John W. Harrison, Victoria TX, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>I was able to successfully install IsoBuster with your help. The first time I used it was a miracle. I had a CD backup of an old DOS program that I had on my old WIN98 computer and when I had first tried to read it, it showed as a blank disk. Using Isobuster I could immediately read the data and transfer it in usable form to my new XP computer. That has saved me several hundred hours of work since the data represents 30 years of collecting my family geneologic data that would have had be re-entered, Thanks for your fine product.</p> <p class="italic blue">John C. Speaks, Williamsville New York, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>I just want to let you know that I purchased Isobuster 1 hour ago. It helped me to restore 350 digital-fotos from an old CD which could not be read by any equipment. Isobuster was an easy way to get all of them back, and these fotos were important for me. Thank you very much for being helpful with Isobuster. Such a good Shareware!</p> <p class="italic blue">Dr. Dieter Giese, Heppenheim, Germany</p> </li> <li> <p>I am writing to extend my thanks to your excellent piece of software, truly excellent. A couple of years ago, I had Windows ME with Easy CD creator platinum 5, My PC was showing signs of trouble so I backed my files up using the drop files in CD facility, however I failed to close the CD, anyway I decided to upgrade to XP, only to my horror that my computer would say that the CD are blank..I sought advice I got told on many occasions that it was a lost cause.. after being referred by the Computer Upgrade magazine in the UK I have now managed to recover all my files, thanks to your software.</p> <p class="italic blue">Bilal khalifa, Warwickshire, UK</p> </li> <li> <p>I purchased a new computer recently. With it came new software and hardware. My CD-ROM would not read a cd containing 3 years worth of newsletters from my bicycle club. To say the least I was frantic. The cd burning software support referred me to a program called IsoBuster. It was like a knight in shining armor came along. All my data was saved. I was very pleased. Then when it happened again with another cd I was prepared. Thank you IsoBuster. You saved the data.</p> <p class="italic blue">Phil Renaud, Brantford, Ontario, Canada</p> </li> <li> <p>Hello! Just to tell you how glad I am! Yesterday evening, I downloaded IsoBuster and made a short evaluation, and came back for buying the license. Less than one hour later, a great problem I had with a scratched DVD for about 16 months (lost of a big amount of critical data and photos) was finally solved. I recovered ALL data, still considered as unrecoverable by lot of other programs. Info: this DVD had been UDF formatted using DirectCD. So, thank you.</p> <p class="italic blue">Michel Schmit, France</p> </li> <li> <p>I'm writing because my case might be slightly different or mildly interesting. Basically I was able to use IsoBuster to extract the data I needed from a DVD which was burnt by a fancy DVD-Recorder product in Japan. It was a just-released machine with a hard-disk, tape recorder and DVD-RW all in one. Someone recorded a family video for me from VHS-tape to DVD-R and then sent it to me in Australia. The DVD-R firstly wasn't recognised by Windows at all - and certainly not by any DVD player. Of course, IsoBuster was able to find data on there and retrieve a.VOB file which I was then able to convert and edit and a family video was saved! Thank you.</p> <p class="italic blue">Peter van der Woude, Australia</p> </li> <li> <p>To Smart Projects, With your IsoBuster Pro, I was able to access unreadable CDs where I kept a great many family pictures. With this program, I quickly and easily transferred the recovered data from these unreadable CDROMs on my computer hard disk. Whereas my computer was not able to read these disk, IsoBuster enabled a reading of these picture disks. What a relief! My family pictures saved!! It was well worth the $39.95, and a lot more!! Thank you.</p> <p class="italic blue">Alain C. de la Brousse, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>Thank you; thank you; thank you!!! I was able to recover all my business e-mails from the last year. Your software is phenomenal!! When I first loaded the CD, there was nothing showing. I had to use the option, "Find lost files and folders" and it worked like a charm. I used to be fearful of backing up anything onto a CD but, not anymore.</p> <p class="italic blue">Garth Palanuk, Canada</p> </li> <li> <p>Your program works so well that I am completely amazed. Programs like this usually only live up to about half of their expectations. Yours exceeded mine by 100% (a first). Question: I also need a similar utility for NTFS hard drive recovery. do you know of one that works as well as yours does on DVD's?</p> <p class="italic blue">Mike Cook, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>A testimony to a great product. Thanks for helping me save the DVD+R disc that my Lite On LVW-5007 had erased. Best $39.95 US I ever spent on any software.</p> <p class="italic blue">Kenneth Otto, Cocoa, Florida, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>Just wanted to let you know that IsoBuster is the greatest software I have ever used. Being an indie musician I keep a lot of my files on CD. 2 of my CDs were unreadable until I used IsoBuster. It not only found my files, but brought them back in their original format so I could use them with the original software. THANKS A BUNCH!!!!! I have been trying to pull these files off the discs forever. The only software that came close to it was xxx. But it would not pull up the file names, did not recognize midi or orc files, and cost $89, which I wasn't really ready to part with yet. IsoBuster not only recognized the file names, but brought them back in their entirety. </p> <p class="italic blue">Jeff "Tink" Tincher - Music Label: NiteLife Music</p> </li> <li> <p>Thanks for this tool, saved my neck. I managed to corrupt an important project file I had been working on for days and days. Being an engineer I am almost always in the habit of keeping multiple backups of files like this, this is perhaps the first time I broke that habit... And of course I have never had a corrupt CD before now. So after a few hours of panic, I was relieved to find your tool has recovered my file. I now have several backup copies,...</p> <p class="italic blue">Stuart Goggin, Melbourne Australia.</p> </li> <li> <p>A Ulead movie making product recently trashed half a DVD-RAM disk without me even writing anything to it (That is insane, these things should only happen during a write, not a read) and I thought I had lost all my important data. Thanks to your product, I was able to recover the other half of the DVD intact. Their driver clashed with the native BHA corp DVD-RAM disk driver for my hardware and didn't even warn me!! Your product was a worthwhile purchase and saved my software and my sanity.
Thank you.</p> <p class="italic blue">Mikl&#243;s G Bolv&#225;ry, Australia</p> </li> <li> <p>I just wanted to thank you for the excellent way your program recovered my CD data. This CD contained all my companies receipts from 1997 / 2000 and was irretrievable in any cd reader. I needed this cd for an audit, you're a life saver...</p> <p class="italic blue">Bob N. Pres.CCW Inc., Canada</p> </li> <li> <p>I just wanted to tell you that your program made me look like a hero recovering data in a UDF CD that XP couldn't read. Thanks for writing it. It was happily paid for and that is rare indeed.</p> <p class="italic blue">Michael Mccormack, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>I want to congratulate with you for you excellent job! I just succeeded today in recovering an audio cd, in mp3 format, I recorded for myself with my preferred songs; the cd had been cracked, in the physical meaning, I ' ve been able to read it and recover. I must admit that I had first to use a product for nails I stole from my wife, (it is a transparent for nails that helped masking the cracked area, helping refraction. By the way only Isobuster was able to read it, nor Windows XP, nor Win Rip</p> <p class="italic blue">Roberto, Italy</p> </li> <li> <p>Just want to let you know that I tried 3 different software solutions presumably "best of all" AND "pay before you do something" that didn't do any thing good about may missing files on CD before I finally tried your great Iso-Buster software. Your program recovered these files in a second. I was absolutely astonished! Wished I didn't throw away those CD's that I thought were un-recoverable.</p> <p class="italic blue">Christian Charbonneau, Montr&#233;al Qu&#233;bec, Canada</p> </li> <li> <p>I bought IsoBuster today at the suggestion of the Nero support team. I have a CD, very precious, which I have been unable to open. I can hardly believe it, but your amazing program was able to read it!! It was also able to open a CD of my Mother's which was corrupted while it was being closed on her computer. This contained her entire hard drive back-up. We didn't know it was corrupt till we tried to reinstall the data on her formatted hard drive! IsoBuster managed to read and save it for me. I am so grateful - thank you so much. I will tell everyone I know about it; it is worth every penny! Thanks again.</p> <p class="italic blue">Christina Carpenter </p> </li> <li> <p>I keep all my data backed up on rewritable DVDs (DVD+RW), and recently I was writing a file to the disk using Sonic Record Now software and got a disk corruption message. I then rebooted and reinserted the disk, only to find that it was completely blank. So I had almost given up hope until someone told me about IsoBuster. I then eagerly tried it, and it saved all my data!!!!!! I had over 3.5 GB of irreplaceable data on the disk, and I just wanted to thank you for the truly fine piece of software you created.</p> <p class="italic blue">Bob, Portland, OR, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>I just have to THANK YOU for a great program. A couple months ago I lost my life's savings of files (probably a few thousand, literally). My DVD backups (I thought I covered my butt by having two copies) for some reason would not read or show my directory/files. How depressing!!!!! Last night I bought your program and did a full scan ("Find Missing Files or Folders") on a disk that I had "quick formatted" a couple of times and re-copied my copy onto (in an earlier unsuccessful attempt to recover my files). ISOBuster recovered ALL of my files!!! ALL OF THEM!!! I'm so happy =0)</p> <p class="italic blue">Roberta E. Traw, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>I'm a Tech. Support Manager for a fortune 500 company and thought I had seen it all until a corrupt program wiped out a critical directory for a side business on my personal CD. All other files were there except one directory. After trying several other recovery programs (one couldn't even see the CD at all), I was amazed and thrilled that IsoBuster recovered all of my data! And it was sooooo easy to use. I can't thank you enough!</p> <p class="italic blue">Sherry Balice, Rockford, IL, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>Peter, you are a genius! The files not only show up, they extract and they all appear to be good! I've used other recovery tools in the past and had extremely disappointing results. IsoBuster not only recovered the files, it got the filenames right and was *super* easy to use. I have been trying to get this data back literally for years. Thank you!!</p> <p class="italic blue">Robert Kesterson, Dallas, TX, USA</p> </li> <li> <p>I have just purchased IsoBuster on line. I had a couple of CDs of family photos that were no longer readable on my PC and which were irreplaceable. IsoBuster retrieved every file quickly and easily with the minimum of input by me. Thanks for a brilliant product, even if I never use it again it has already been more than worth the price. Even the purchasing and registration processes were rapid and fault free.</p> Cheers
      <p class="italic blue">John Moss</p> </li> <li> <p>Hi Peter. must congratulate you for your program. Absolutely awesome! I could recover 100% of all the files I thought I had lost!!! Magnificent! I have tried many other applications in the past but no one came even near yours...some couldn't even read the CD, others would charge me crazy fees and had to send them the CD because their software couldn't do the job..!! And your price tag, absolute value for money!!! Keep up your excellent work! All the very best.</p> <p class="italic blue">Alessandro (An extremely happy customer)</p> </li> <li> <p>Hi Peter, I just wanted to say thanks for a great programme which has enabled me to recover lots of lost data due to problems with my Toshiba CR-R/RW combo. Hopefully my new Plextor will be more reliable! Once again, thanks very much. Regards</p> <p class="italic blue">Colin</p> </li> <li> <p>Nero froze my laptop while burning the lead-in/lead-out at the end of a second session on a CD-R. After reboot, only the second session was available when the CD was in the built-in laptop CD-ROM, while freezing the system when in the USB CD-R/RW writer. This excellent program enabled the CD-ROM to read and recover the lost data. Excellent! Highly Recommended!</p> <p class="italic blue">VT, Vancouver, Canada</p> </li> <li> <p>I purchase you recovery program and I am amazed with your program. I had one CD that my computer didn't recognized anymore and you program really works great. I was able to recover 10.7 MB of images in just a few minutes. I was also amazed how fast and easy it was to use.</p>  Thank you
