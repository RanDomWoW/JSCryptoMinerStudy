<h1>Welcome!</h1>


<p>
PlanetMath is a virtual community which aims to help make mathematical knowledge more accessible. PlanetMath's content is created collaboratively: the main feature is the mathematics encyclopedia with entries written and reviewed by members (<a href="msc.html">subject index</a>, <a href="alphabetical.html">alphabetical index</a>).
</p>

<p>
The entries are contributed under the terms of the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons By/Share-Alike License</a> in order to preserve the rights of authors, readers and other content creators in a sensible way.  Entries are written in LaTeX, the lingua franca of the worldwide mathematical community.  Articles are then rendered for presentation on the web using <a href="https://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/">LaTeXML</a>, and links between them are added using <a href="https://github.com/dginev/nnexus">NNexus</a>.
</p>

<p>
As of 2018, source files are editable via <a href="https://github.com/planetmath">planetmath's repositories on Github</a>: acceptable <a href="https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr++archived%3Afalse+user%3Aplanetmath+">pull requests</a> will be merged by one of our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/planetmath/people">Editors</a>.
</p>

<p>
Along with this change to the way editing works, the legacy forums have been decommissioned, and we have created <a href="https://gitter.im/planetmath/home">Gitter discussion channels for each mathematics subject category</a>, in order to facilitate real-time discussion.
</p>

<p>
The PlanetMath.org website is hosted by the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/">University of Waterloo Faculty of Mathematics</a>.   PlanetMath.org, Ltd., is a 501(c)3 nonprofit, incorporated in Alexandria, Virginia, USA.
