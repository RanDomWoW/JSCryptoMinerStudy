Is that worrying? Hard to tell &a;ndash; that figure is too big to contemplate. That is why we have scaled it and a few other debt-related figures down to human proportions, at the level of a household budget. This instructional video will &a;ndash; quite literally &a;ndash; bring the debt problem home to you:&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;div style=\&q;position: relative; height:0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\&q;&g;&l;iframe allowfullscreen=\&q;\&q; frameborder=\&q;0\&q; height=\&q;450\&q; mozallowfullscreen=\&q;\&q; src=\&q;//player.vimeo.com/video/193865286\&q; style=\&q;position:absolute; top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%;\&q; webkitallowfullscreen=\&q;\&q; width=\&q;770\&q;&g;&l;/iframe&g;&l;/div&g;\n\n&l;p&g;Translating the amount of tax revenue and government outlays to the ins and outs of your family budget, our video gives you an idea of the size of the issue by presenting the debt amounts as graspable figures. Those figures might not be as astronomical as the real amounts, but they are better at conveying the core of the problem.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;ul&g;\n\t&l;li&g;The annual &l;a href=\&q;https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/52152-mbr.pdf\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;U.S. Tax Revenue amounts to more than three trillion dollars&l;/a&g;.&a;nbsp;That&a;rsquo;s $3,267 billion, to be exact. Both figures dazzle the mind, but if we lop off eight zeroes, we have an amount that could well be your household&a;rsquo;s annual income: $32,670.&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;The U.S. Federal Government plans to spend close to four trillion dollars. Total outlays are close to of $3,854 billion. Again, translated to a normal-sized family budget, that amounts to an annual spend of $38,540.&a;nbsp;&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;&l;strong&g;There is an obvious hole in the budget here, and on federal level, it corresponds to $587 billion&l;/strong&g;. Scaled down to family size, that becomes new credit card debt of $5,870.&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;Unfortunately, it&a;rsquo;s not the first year the U.S. Federal Government is running a deficit. This year&a;rsquo;s debt is added to the outstanding debt, which now totals over $19 trillion, or $19,333 billion. Eliminate the right amount of zeroes, and your household owes a total of $193,338.&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;That&a;rsquo;s enough to knock the stuffing out of any budget planner. &l;a href=\&q;https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2016/assets/ccs.pdf\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;There is a silver lining: budget cuts of $24 billion&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;. Sounds like a lot, but to put that in perspective: it&a;rsquo;s as if you managed to cut your annual household spend by no more than $243.&l;/li&g;\n&l;/ul&g;\n\n&l;p&g;The actual amount of U.S. federal debt is world-record-breaking, and almost beyond comprehension. But that doesn&a;rsquo;t mean the problem isn&a;rsquo;t real, or indeed very serious. As indicated by a &l;a href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/articles/per-capita-debt\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;previous article on our website&l;/a&g;, the U.S. has one of the world&a;rsquo;s highest per-capita public debt rates in the world. Scaling down the problem to a level everyone can understand &a;ndash; we all have household budgets &a;ndash; serves as a much-needed wake-up call.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Please feel free to&a;nbsp;leave your comments below!

Although gas prices may seem low now, Americans are still very budget conscious when it comes to filling their tanks. The miles per gallon (MPG) rating on a car is an important measure for American consumers, as this tells smart shoppers how many miles they&a;rsquo;ll get out of every full tank, and how far their dollar will stretch on the road. To illustrate this, we&a;rsquo;ve made a graphic of the distance America&a;rsquo;s top 10 vehicles can travel on only $50 of fuel.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;&l;img alt=\&q;\&q; class=\&q;img-responsive ng-isolate-scope\&q; facebook-text=\&q;This GIF Shows Which of America’s Best Selling Cars Stretch the Most Miles for $50 of Gas\&q; facebook-title=\&q;How Far do America&s;s Top 10 Cars Get on $50 of Fuel?\&q; share-buttons=\&q;\&q; share-cropbox=\&q;0,0,1271,665\&q; share-image=\&q;https://cdn.howmuch.net/content/images/top-selling-cars-distance-with-50-dollars-63b0-cb5f.gif\&q; share-image-original=\&q;https://cdn.howmuch.net/content/images/top-selling-cars-distance-with-50-dollars-63b0.gif\&q; sizes=\&q;100vw\&q; src=\&q;//cdn.howmuch.net/content/images/top-selling-cars-distance-with-50-dollars-63b0.gif\&q; srcset=\&q;//cdn.howmuch.net/content/images/1600/top-selling-cars-distance-with-50-dollars-63b0.gif\&q; text=\&q;This GIF Shows Which of America’s Best Selling Cars Stretch the Most Miles for $50 of Gas\&q; twitter-text=\&q;GIF Shows Which of USA&s;s Best Selling #Cars Stretch the Most Miles for $50 of Gas pic.twitter.com/Huz6rN1f9X http://bit.ly/2rPoL5j #dataviz\&q; /&g;The graphic above shows the top-selling vehicles in America placed on a graph. The graph the vehicles lie on represents a maximum travel distance of 800 miles, with 100-mile intervals. The vehicles travel along the graph and stop when each vehicle has reached the distance it can travel using only $50 of fuel. The data for each vehicle was collected from the&l;a href=\&q;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16Xps3SSoOUG93qi23KkaDneEEAzXa-YaOa0AeDbJex8/edit#gid=2127268296\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; U.S. Energy Information Administration&l;/a&g; and&l;a href=\&q;https://www.kbb.com/car-reviews-and-news/top-10/best-selling-cars-2016/2100000978-1/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Kelley Blue Book&l;/a&g;. Their distance traveled, based on MPG, was calculated using methods described by the&l;a href=\&q;https://www.fueleconomy.gov/mpg/MPG.do?action=calcMPG\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; U.S. Department of Energy&l;/a&g;.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;The 3 top vehicles that travel the farthest on $50&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;ul&g;\n\t&l;li&g;Honda Civic - 722 miles&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;Toyota Corolla - 639 miles&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;Honda CR-V - 598 miles&l;/li&g;\n&l;/ul&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;The 3 top vehicles that travel the least distance on $50&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;ul&g;\n\t&l;li&g;Chevrolet Silverado - 392 miles&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;Ram Truck - 413 miles&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;Ford F-Series - 413 miles&l;/li&g;\n&l;/ul&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;As the graphic changes over time, the first visible trend is the three vehicles that travel the least distance on $50 of fuel. These three vehicles, some of the most popular in America, are all trucks; the Chevrolet Silverado, the Ram Truck, and the Ford F-Series. Trucks and similar vehicles tend to perform worse on MPG tests because they are larger and bulkier compared to standard cars. These three trucks have the lowest MPG and therefore travel the least distance on the graph and on the road. Another trend clearly displayed by the graphic is the &l;strong&g;prevalence of Japanese automakers&l;/strong&g;. &l;strong&g;Seven of the 10 best selling cars of 2016 are Japanese auto brands&l;/strong&g;, according to the Kelley Blue Book report cited above. Toyota and Honda each have three of the top selling automobiles, while Nissan has just one. Japanese manufacturers are well known for their efficiency and the report above proves it. The car that travels the farthest on $50 of fuel is the Honda Civic, with a maximum of 722 miles on $50 of fuel and an MPG rating of 35.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;More than anything, this graphic shows that the top selling cars in America do not necessarily have the same level of fuel efficiency. Americans frequently buy trucks, but these trucks travel drastically less distance on $50 of fuel compared to smaller vehicles. Japanese cars, which are known for their efficiency, can travel quite a distance on just $50. Opinions on the colors, bodies, and even hauling capacity of popular cars can be debated, driving distance and MPG are hard facts. Looking at the numbers, one thing is clear; while you are free to buy any car you like, your mileage will undoubtedly vary.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;Sources: &l;a href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/sources/top-10-cars-usa-with-50-dollars-fuel\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Table 1.1&l;/a&g;&a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/top-10-cars-usa-with-50-dollars-fuel&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;GIF Shows Which of USA&s;s Best Selling #Cars Stretch the Most Miles for $50 of Gas pic.twitter.com/Huz6rN1f9X http://bit.ly/2rPoL5j #dataviz&q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;How Far do America&s;s Top 10 Cars Get on $50 of Fuel?&q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;This GIF Shows Which of America’s Best Selling Cars Stretch the Most Miles for $50 of Gas&q;,&q;publishDate&q;:&q;2017-05-24T00:00:00.000Z&q;,&q;readableDate&q;:&q;24 May 2017&q;,&q;author&q;:&q;Raul&q;,&q;view&q;:&q;default&q;,&q;firstName&q;:&q;raul&q;,&q;ogImage&q;:null,&q;ogImageUrls&q;:[&q;https://cdn.howmuch.net/content/images/top-selling-cars-distance-with-50-dollars-63b0-cb5f.gif&q;],&q;pageUrl&q;:&q;/articles/top-10-cars-usa-with-50-dollars-fuel&q;,&q;canonicalUrl&q;:&q;https://0.0.0.0:8081NaN&q;,&q;pageMetaTitle&q;:&q;How Far do America&s;s Top 10 Cars Get on $50 of Fuel?&q;,&q;pageMetaDescription&q;:&q;This GIF Shows Which of America’s Best Selling Cars Stretch the Most Miles for $50 of Gas&q;,&q;pageId&q;:&q;591190c73c58526055b2f746&q;,&q;shareCopy&q;:null,&q;embeddedTweetHtml&q;:null,&q;thumbnail&q;:&q;//cdn.howmuch.net/content/images/top-selling-cars-distance-with-50-dollars-63b0.gif&q;,&q;unbrandedImage&q;:&q;//cdn.howmuch.net/unbranded/top-selling-cars-distance-with-50-dollars-63b1.png&q;,&q;category&q;:&q;Personal Finance&q;,&q;categoryId&q;:&q;personal-finance&q;,&q;tag&q;:&q;Visualization&q;,&q;excerpt&q;:&q;Gas prices have always been a huge concern for the American driver.

Is that worrying? Hard to tell &a;ndash; that figure is too big to contemplate. That is why we have scaled it and a few other debt-related figures down to human proportions, at the level of a household budget. This instructional video will &a;ndash; quite literally &a;ndash; bring the debt problem home to you:&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;div style=\&q;position: relative; height:0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\&q;&g;&l;iframe allowfullscreen=\&q;\&q; frameborder=\&q;0\&q; height=\&q;450\&q; mozallowfullscreen=\&q;\&q; src=\&q;//player.vimeo.com/video/193865286\&q; style=\&q;position:absolute; top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%;\&q; webkitallowfullscreen=\&q;\&q; width=\&q;770\&q;&g;&l;/iframe&g;&l;/div&g;\n\n&l;p&g;Translating the amount of tax revenue and government outlays to the ins and outs of your family budget, our video gives you an idea of the size of the issue by presenting the debt amounts as graspable figures. Those figures might not be as astronomical as the real amounts, but they are better at conveying the core of the problem.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;ul&g;\n\t&l;li&g;The annual &l;a href=\&q;https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/52152-mbr.pdf\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;U.S. Tax Revenue amounts to more than three trillion dollars&l;/a&g;.&a;nbsp;That&a;rsquo;s $3,267 billion, to be exact. Both figures dazzle the mind, but if we lop off eight zeroes, we have an amount that could well be your household&a;rsquo;s annual income: $32,670.&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;The U.S. Federal Government plans to spend close to four trillion dollars. Total outlays are close to of $3,854 billion. Again, translated to a normal-sized family budget, that amounts to an annual spend of $38,540.&a;nbsp;&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;&l;strong&g;There is an obvious hole in the budget here, and on federal level, it corresponds to $587 billion&l;/strong&g;. Scaled down to family size, that becomes new credit card debt of $5,870.&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;Unfortunately, it&a;rsquo;s not the first year the U.S. Federal Government is running a deficit. This year&a;rsquo;s debt is added to the outstanding debt, which now totals over $19 trillion, or $19,333 billion. Eliminate the right amount of zeroes, and your household owes a total of $193,338.&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;That&a;rsquo;s enough to knock the stuffing out of any budget planner. &l;a href=\&q;https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2016/assets/ccs.pdf\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;There is a silver lining: budget cuts of $24 billion&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;. Sounds like a lot, but to put that in perspective: it&a;rsquo;s as if you managed to cut your annual household spend by no more than $243.&l;/li&g;\n&l;/ul&g;\n\n&l;p&g;The actual amount of U.S. federal debt is world-record-breaking, and almost beyond comprehension. But that doesn&a;rsquo;t mean the problem isn&a;rsquo;t real, or indeed very serious. As indicated by a &l;a href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/articles/per-capita-debt\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;previous article on our website&l;/a&g;, the U.S. has one of the world&a;rsquo;s highest per-capita public debt rates in the world.

It is the basis of what other coverages are built on and should be the first coverage considered for your protection. Whether your business is a one-person operation, Mom and Pop, or an established corporation with 50 employees, General Liability should always be included in your insurance portfolio.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Your general liability is what will financially protect your business in the event that you or your employees cause bodily injury or property damage to a third-party (customer). Typically known as “slip and fall” insurance, your general liability coverage goes much further in the event of a loss (claim). Every General Liability policy consists of a core group of coverages, but can be endorsed (added to) to design an insurance solution that will meet the needs of your particular type of business.&l;/p&g;&l;h3&g;What is Covered under General Liability Insurance?&l;/h3&g;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;Bodily Injury Liability&l;/strong&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;This coverage&a;nbsp;pays when you are found liable for injuries to a third party as a result of your business activities.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;em&g;For example, an employee of your flower shop is watering plants within the store and gets the floor wet. If a customer walks by and slips and falls because of the wet floor, your general liability would pay if an action is brought against you. Your insurance would pay for settlement costs or a judgment awarded by the court.&l;/em&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;Property Damage Liability&l;/strong&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The property damage coverage in your general liability policy pays for damages you or your employees cause to third party as a result of your business activities.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;em&g;As an example, consider a roofing business that is repairing an area of a roof damaged by a fire. While your employee is on the roof of a customer’s home, a large piece of equipment slides off the roof and goes through the roof of your customer’s luxury convertible. Rather than having to pay out-of-pocket to repair the car, your property damage coverage would reimburse your customer for repairs to their vehicle.​&l;/em&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;Personal and Advertising Injury Liability&l;/strong&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Personal and Advertising Injury is not about injuries to a person. This policy provides coverage if you or your employees cause a financial loss as a result of your advertising efforts. Personal and Advertising Injury&a;nbsp;applies if your business is found liable for financial loss to a third party (your customer) because of slander, libel, copyright infringement, or invasion of privacy.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;Medical Payments&l;/strong&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Medical Payments coverage provides coverage for injuries to a third party at your business location or any other location where you or your employees are conducting business activities. The medical payments coverage differs from bodily injury liability because proof of liability is not required. Typically this coverage will pay in the event of a &a;nbsp;non-serious injury and funds will be distributed quickly without the need for a lawsuit.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;Defense costs&l;/strong&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;One of the greatest expenses associated with a lawsuit is the cost of your legal defense. Every action brought against your business must be responded to by legal counsel even if it appears to be frivolous and without merit. Your general liability insurance provides for legal counsel that is assigned by and paid for by your insurer.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;Optional Coverages (Endorsements)&l;/strong&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Many insurance carriers will allow the policyholder to add optional coverages to the basic general liability policy that are normally excluded in order to deliver a more comprehensive insurance solution.&l;/p&g;&l;ul&g;&l;li&g;Liquor Liability endorsement&l;/li&g;&l;li&g;Employment Practices Liability endorsement&l;/li&g;&l;li&g;Manufacturers and contractors liability&l;/li&g;&l;/ul&g;&l;h3&g;How Much Does General Liability Insurance Cost?&l;/h3&g;&l;p&g;The cost for General Liability insurance averages &l;strong&g;$500-$600&l;/strong&g; and is always determined by the amount of risk exposure (what can go wrong) being accepted by the insurer. For example, a home contractor is going to pay significantly more than an accountant because of the risk associated with each industry. Although there are many exposures that affect the price of a policy, insurers are typically most concerned about the following:&l;/p&g;&l;ul&g;&l;li&g;The industry you are working in, such as contractors, service, hospitality, retail, or professional.&l;/li&g;&l;li&g;Years in business.&l;/li&g;&l;li&g;Number of customers.&l;/li&g;&l;li&g;Annual revenue.&l;/li&g;&l;li&g;History of claims.&l;/li&g;&l;/ul&g;&l;p&g;Your cost for General Liability insurance is going to be determined by your answers to several underwriting questions, many which are listed above. To provide a price indication by industry, you can consider the following amounts as a basis for a $1 million General Liability policy:&l;/p&g;&l;ul&g;&l;li&g;Hair Salon/Barber Shop:&a;nbsp;&l;strong&g;$450 annually&l;/strong&g;&l;/li&g;&l;li&g;Cable/Satellite Dish Installer: &l;strong&g;$550 annually&l;/strong&g;&l;/li&g;&l;li&g;Small Retail Store: &l;strong&g;$750 annually&l;/strong&g;&l;/li&g;&l;li&g;Computer Repair Service: &l;strong&g;$400 annually&l;/strong&g;&l;/li&g;&l;/ul&g;&l;p&g;As you may have noticed, the most expensive policy is for the retail store. This is primarily because retail stores have a continuous flow of traffic coming in and out each day which translates into a higher exposure than the other industries listed.&l;/p&g;&l;h3&g;Coverage Consideration&l;/h3&g;&l;p&g;Although the general liability policy is considered the foundation of small business insurance, it is a limited policy and there are many risks that are not covered. Some of the other policies that should be considered by every business owner are:&l;/p&g;&l;ul&g;&l;li&g;&l;a data-cke-saved-href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/costs/workers-compensation\&q; href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/costs/workers-compensation\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;Workers’ Compensation&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;: If you have at least one employee, your business is responsible to pay for the costs associated with an injury or illness that is work related.&l;/li&g;&l;li&g;&l;strong&g;Professional Liability&l;/strong&g;: If you are a professional in your industry or required to be licensed to operate, your general liability will not pay for losses associated with your professional services to a customer.&l;/li&g;&l;li&g;&l;a data-cke-saved-href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/costs/commercial-auto-insurance\&q; href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/costs/commercial-auto-insurance\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;Commercial Auto&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;: Most personal auto policies exclude coverage on vehicles while they are being used for business.

Data breaches have become common and are very expensive for any victimized business. In today’s technological environment, it’s no longer a matter of IF you suffer a data breach, but WHEN you suffer a data breach.&l;/li&g;&l;/ul&g;&l;p&g;For most consumers, commercial insurance is a confusing and even intimidating product that must be dealt with in order to operate your business safely. If you are unsure of your options and are looking for advice, contact an insurance professional who can provide you with the information you need to make an informed decision about transferring your everyday risks to a highly rated insurance company.&l;/p&g;&q;,&q;costGuideAction&q;:&q;&q;,&q;mediumCost&q;:&q;$550 (annually, $1 million basis)&q;,&q;fixrTasks&q;:&q;general_liability_insurance&q;,&q;category&q;:&q;704&q;,&q;categoryName&q;:&q;Business Insurance&q;,&q;group&q;:4,&q;relatedCostGuides&q;:[],&q;cities&q;:[],&q;averagePrice&q;:&q;$550&q;,&q;averagePriceDescription&q;:&q;(annually, $1 million basis)&q;,&q;lowerPrice&q;:&q;$250&q;,&q;lowerPriceDescription&q;:&q;&q;,&q;upperPrice&q;:&q;$2,000&q;,&q;upperPriceDescription&q;:&q;&q;,&q;seoId&q;:&q;general-liability-insurance&q;,&q;costAction&q;:&q;&q;,&q;layout&q;:&q;2-columns&q;,&q;verticalType&q;:&q;2&q;,&q;pricesRangeDescription&q;:&q;Price ranges from $250 to $2,000 and also varies depending on the industry you are working in, years in business, number of customers, annual revenue and history of claims.&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/costs/general-liability-insurance&q;,&q;summaryPicture&q;:&q;https://cdn.howmuch.net/costguide/rest-of-insurance-guides.jpg&q;,&q;pageMetaTitle&q;:&q;General Liability Insurance Cost - Estimates and Prices at Howmuch&q;,&q;pageMetaDescription&q;:&q;General liability insurance cost are about $550 (annually, $1 million basis).

It is the basis of what other coverages are built on and should be the first coverage considered for your protection. Whether your business is a one-person operation, Mom and Pop, or an established corporation with 50 employees, General Liability should always be included in your insurance portfolio.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Your general liability is what will financially protect your business in the event that you or your employees cause bodily injury or property damage to a third-party (customer). Typically known as “slip and fall” insurance, your general liability coverage goes much further in the event of a loss (claim). Every General Liability policy consists of a core group of coverages, but can be endorsed (added to) to design an insurance solution that will meet the needs of your particular type of business.&l;/p&g;&l;h3&g;What is Covered under General Liability Insurance?&l;/h3&g;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;Bodily Injury Liability&l;/strong&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;This coverage&a;nbsp;pays when you are found liable for injuries to a third party as a result of your business activities.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;em&g;For example, an employee of your flower shop is watering plants within the store and gets the floor wet. If a customer walks by and slips and falls because of the wet floor, your general liability would pay if an action is brought against you. Your insurance would pay for settlement costs or a judgment awarded by the court.&l;/em&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;Property Damage Liability&l;/strong&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The property damage coverage in your general liability policy pays for damages you or your employees cause to third party as a result of your business activities.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;em&g;As an example, consider a roofing business that is repairing an area of a roof damaged by a fire. While your employee is on the roof of a customer’s home, a large piece of equipment slides off the roof and goes through the roof of your customer’s luxury convertible. Rather than having to pay out-of-pocket to repair the car, your property damage coverage would reimburse your customer for repairs to their vehicle.​&l;/em&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;Personal and Advertising Injury Liability&l;/strong&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Personal and Advertising Injury is not about injuries to a person. This policy provides coverage if you or your employees cause a financial loss as a result of your advertising efforts. Personal and Advertising Injury&a;nbsp;applies if your business is found liable for financial loss to a third party (your customer) because of slander, libel, copyright infringement, or invasion of privacy.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;Medical Payments&l;/strong&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Medical Payments coverage provides coverage for injuries to a third party at your business location or any other location where you or your employees are conducting business activities. The medical payments coverage differs from bodily injury liability because proof of liability is not required. Typically this coverage will pay in the event of a &a;nbsp;non-serious injury and funds will be distributed quickly without the need for a lawsuit.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;Defense costs&l;/strong&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;One of the greatest expenses associated with a lawsuit is the cost of your legal defense. Every action brought against your business must be responded to by legal counsel even if it appears to be frivolous and without merit. Your general liability insurance provides for legal counsel that is assigned by and paid for by your insurer.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;Optional Coverages (Endorsements)&l;/strong&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Many insurance carriers will allow the policyholder to add optional coverages to the basic general liability policy that are normally excluded in order to deliver a more comprehensive insurance solution.&l;/p&g;&l;ul&g;&l;li&g;Liquor Liability endorsement&l;/li&g;&l;li&g;Employment Practices Liability endorsement&l;/li&g;&l;li&g;Manufacturers and contractors liability&l;/li&g;&l;/ul&g;&l;h3&g;How Much Does General Liability Insurance Cost?&l;/h3&g;&l;p&g;The cost for General Liability insurance averages &l;strong&g;$500-$600&l;/strong&g; and is always determined by the amount of risk exposure (what can go wrong) being accepted by the insurer. For example, a home contractor is going to pay significantly more than an accountant because of the risk associated with each industry. Although there are many exposures that affect the price of a policy, insurers are typically most concerned about the following:&l;/p&g;&l;ul&g;&l;li&g;The industry you are working in, such as contractors, service, hospitality, retail, or professional.&l;/li&g;&l;li&g;Years in business.&l;/li&g;&l;li&g;Number of customers.&l;/li&g;&l;li&g;Annual revenue.&l;/li&g;&l;li&g;History of claims.&l;/li&g;&l;/ul&g;&l;p&g;Your cost for General Liability insurance is going to be determined by your answers to several underwriting questions, many which are listed above. To provide a price indication by industry, you can consider the following amounts as a basis for a $1 million General Liability policy:&l;/p&g;&l;ul&g;&l;li&g;Hair Salon/Barber Shop:&a;nbsp;&l;strong&g;$450 annually&l;/strong&g;&l;/li&g;&l;li&g;Cable/Satellite Dish Installer: &l;strong&g;$550 annually&l;/strong&g;&l;/li&g;&l;li&g;Small Retail Store: &l;strong&g;$750 annually&l;/strong&g;&l;/li&g;&l;li&g;Computer Repair Service: &l;strong&g;$400 annually&l;/strong&g;&l;/li&g;&l;/ul&g;&l;p&g;As you may have noticed, the most expensive policy is for the retail store. This is primarily because retail stores have a continuous flow of traffic coming in and out each day which translates into a higher exposure than the other industries listed.&l;/p&g;&l;h3&g;Coverage Consideration&l;/h3&g;&l;p&g;Although the general liability policy is considered the foundation of small business insurance, it is a limited policy and there are many risks that are not covered. Some of the other policies that should be considered by every business owner are:&l;/p&g;&l;ul&g;&l;li&g;&l;a data-cke-saved-href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/costs/workers-compensation\&q; href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/costs/workers-compensation\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;Workers’ Compensation&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;: If you have at least one employee, your business is responsible to pay for the costs associated with an injury or illness that is work related.&l;/li&g;&l;li&g;&l;strong&g;Professional Liability&l;/strong&g;: If you are a professional in your industry or required to be licensed to operate, your general liability will not pay for losses associated with your professional services to a customer.&l;/li&g;&l;li&g;&l;a data-cke-saved-href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/costs/commercial-auto-insurance\&q; href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/costs/commercial-auto-insurance\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;Commercial Auto&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;: Most personal auto policies exclude coverage on vehicles while they are being used for business.

In today’s technological environment, it’s no longer a matter of IF you suffer a data breach, but WHEN you suffer a data breach.&l;/li&g;&l;/ul&g;&l;p&g;For most consumers, commercial insurance is a confusing and even intimidating product that must be dealt with in order to operate your business safely.

Although gas prices may seem low now, Americans are still very budget conscious when it comes to filling their tanks. The miles per gallon (MPG) rating on a car is an important measure for American consumers, as this tells smart shoppers how many miles they&a;rsquo;ll get out of every full tank, and how far their dollar will stretch on the road.

The graph the vehicles lie on represents a maximum travel distance of 800 miles, with 100-mile intervals. The vehicles travel along the graph and stop when each vehicle has reached the distance it can travel using only $50 of fuel. The data for each vehicle was collected from the&l;a href=\&q;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16Xps3SSoOUG93qi23KkaDneEEAzXa-YaOa0AeDbJex8/edit#gid=2127268296\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; U.S. Energy Information Administration&l;/a&g; and&l;a href=\&q;https://www.kbb.com/car-reviews-and-news/top-10/best-selling-cars-2016/2100000978-1/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Kelley Blue Book&l;/a&g;.

These three vehicles, some of the most popular in America, are all trucks; the Chevrolet Silverado, the Ram Truck, and the Ford F-Series. Trucks and similar vehicles tend to perform worse on MPG tests because they are larger and bulkier compared to standard cars. These three trucks have the lowest MPG and therefore travel the least distance on the graph and on the road. Another trend clearly displayed by the graphic is the &l;strong&g;prevalence of Japanese automakers&l;/strong&g;. &l;strong&g;Seven of the 10 best selling cars of 2016 are Japanese auto brands&l;/strong&g;, according to the Kelley Blue Book report cited above. Toyota and Honda each have three of the top selling automobiles, while Nissan has just one. Japanese manufacturers are well known for their efficiency and the report above proves it. The car that travels the farthest on $50 of fuel is the Honda Civic, with a maximum of 722 miles on $50 of fuel and an MPG rating of 35.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;More than anything, this graphic shows that the top selling cars in America do not necessarily have the same level of fuel efficiency. Americans frequently buy trucks, but these trucks travel drastically less distance on $50 of fuel compared to smaller vehicles. Japanese cars, which are known for their efficiency, can travel quite a distance on just $50. Opinions on the colors, bodies, and even hauling capacity of popular cars can be debated, driving distance and MPG are hard facts. Looking at the numbers, one thing is clear; while you are free to buy any car you like, your mileage will undoubtedly vary.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;Sources: &l;a href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/sources/top-10-cars-usa-with-50-dollars-fuel\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Table 1.1&l;/a&g;&a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/top-10-cars-usa-with-50-dollars-fuel&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;GIF Shows Which of USA&s;s Best Selling #Cars Stretch the Most Miles for $50 of Gas pic.twitter.com/Huz6rN1f9X http://bit.ly/2rPoL5j #dataviz&q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;How Far do America&s;s Top 10 Cars Get on $50 of Fuel?&q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;This GIF Shows Which of America’s Best Selling Cars Stretch the Most Miles for $50 of Gas&q;,&q;publishDate&q;:&q;2017-05-24T00:00:00.000Z&q;,&q;readableDate&q;:&q;24 May 2017&q;,&q;author&q;:&q;Raul&q;,&q;view&q;:&q;default&q;,&q;firstName&q;:&q;raul&q;,&q;ogImage&q;:null,&q;ogImageUrls&q;:[&q;https://cdn.howmuch.net/content/images/top-selling-cars-distance-with-50-dollars-63b0-cb5f.gif&q;],&q;pageUrl&q;:&q;/articles/top-10-cars-usa-with-50-dollars-fuel&q;,&q;canonicalUrl&q;:&q;https://0.0.0.0:8081NaN&q;,&q;pageMetaTitle&q;:&q;How Far do America&s;s Top 10 Cars Get on $50 of Fuel?&q;,&q;pageMetaDescription&q;:&q;This GIF Shows Which of America’s Best Selling Cars Stretch the Most Miles for $50 of Gas&q;,&q;pageId&q;:&q;591190c73c58526055b2f746&q;,&q;shareCopy&q;:null,&q;embeddedTweetHtml&q;:null,&q;thumbnail&q;:&q;//cdn.howmuch.net/content/images/top-selling-cars-distance-with-50-dollars-63b0.gif&q;,&q;unbrandedImage&q;:&q;//cdn.howmuch.net/unbranded/top-selling-cars-distance-with-50-dollars-63b1.png&q;,&q;category&q;:&q;Personal Finance&q;,&q;categoryId&q;:&q;personal-finance&q;,&q;tag&q;:&q;Visualization&q;,&q;excerpt&q;:&q;Gas prices have always been a huge concern for the American driver.

We took the 30 most politically active companies on the Fortune 500 and ranked them in order of their campaign contributions over the last ten years. The bars represent the total contributions ($B) given to candidates in each party. We added the total figures and the percentage breakdown for Democrats and Republicans for easy reference. Several fascinating trends immediately jump out from our visual.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;First off, there&a;rsquo;s a lot more blue than red on the graph, indicating that Democrats rake in most of the political cash from corporate America. Keep in mind that these contributions are coming from employees who work at these companies, not the corporations themselves.

Republicans received more than 50% of the donations from only nine of the 30 companies, most of which tend to be grouped toward the bottom. Additionally, almost all of the bars include a tiny sliver of green, representing contributions to independent candidates. These contributions are there but they definitely don&a;rsquo;t amount to much overall. Ultimately, it is fair to say that employees of these big companies have spent the bulk of their political cash on Democrats over the last decade.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Let&a;rsquo;s take a closer look at the top of the list. Financial institutions dominate the marketplace for political donations, making up six of the top ten companies. Goldman Sachs is in first place by a long shot, shoveling $11.5B to members of both parties. The bank&a;rsquo;s money is split almost evenly across the aisle&a;mdash;possibly showing an effort to hedge against whichever party controls the levers of power. Charles Schwab provides an interesting contrast with Goldman in that the discount broker spends almost 70% of its political donations on Democrats. Microsoft and Apple also crack the top ten, but both companies clearly favor Democrats a lot more than Republicans, pumping 80% and 88%, respectively, of their political money into candidates on the left.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Perhaps the most interesting fact about our visual is what it doesn&a;rsquo;t show. Where is Walmart, the top ranked company on the&l;a href=\&q;http://fortune.com/fortune500/list/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Fortune 500&l;/a&g;? Or Berkshire Hathaway, McKesson, United HealthGroup, or CVS? What about other behemoths like Google or Amazon? Maybe their business models aren&a;rsquo;t as reliant on politicians for their business models to work. On the other hand, if so many major companies are missing from the list, why do employees at these particular companies spend so much on political campaigns? A new piece of legislation or a change in the regulatory environment could drastically affect the bottom line for big banks.

There are currently 19 people in the world who own an equivalent of more than $350 million in crypto assets. The top owners of cryptocurrency in the world amassed their wealth in a variety of ways, but most are founders of large cryptocurrency projects and cryptocurrency exchange platforms. Others are either individual investors or part of investment groups and some have established very profitable cryptocurrency mining operations. The one thing that the richest in crypto have in common is that they are all the types to &a;ldquo;HODL&a;rdquo; (hold on for dear life), meaning that they hold on to their cryptocurrency through any downturns in the market and aren&a;rsquo;t quick to make crypto-to-crypto or crypto-to-fiat trades.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;&l;img alt=\&q;\&q; class=\&q;full-img img-responsive\&q; facebook-text=\&q;In the new era of cryptocurrency boom and bust, a few people have made astronomical profits.

No one else on the list even comes close to Larson&a;rsquo;s net worth. He personally owns 5.2 billion XRP. The amazing thing is that in early 2018 Ripple is only valued around $0.80 to $1.00 on average. If XRP rises to the price level of &l;a href=\&q;https://bitcoin.org/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;BTC&l;/a&g;, or even to the level of &l;a href=\&q;https://www.ethereum.org/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;ETH&l;/a&g;, Larson will very easily become the world&a;rsquo;s richest person and have the potential to be the world&a;rsquo;s first trillionaire.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;Demographics&l;/strong&g;&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Another notable thing to mention about this list is that not everyone made their fortunes early on. While some did invest in the early days of BTC (circa 2009 to 2012), lots of people won big by either working on the team at Ethereum or investing in ETH. This is significant because ETH&a;rsquo;s Initial Coin Offering (ICO) didn&a;rsquo;t take place until July 30, 2015.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;The world&a;rsquo;s largest owners of crypto are also very young. The average age of the 19 richest people in crypto is only 42; in contrast, the average age of the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans is 67. It&a;rsquo;s also interesting to note that there are only men on the crypto list, while two of the people at the top of the &l;a href=\&q;https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/richest-people-in-world-forbes/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;2018 list&l;/a&g; of the world&a;rsquo;s billionaires are women.&a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;Determining the Future of Crypto Wealth&l;/strong&g;&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;With price fluctuations and the rise of new cryptocurrencies, the rankings for the wealthiest people in crypto is likely to change a lot in the coming years. The crypto market price volatility in January and February 2018, for example, was much higher compared to blue chip stocks or commodities like gold. That means that the rankings could change drastically, even week to week.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;Promising new cryptos continue to emerge every day. Some have the technology and resources behind them to overtake the current breadwinners. On top of that, new, decentralized exchanges are emerging to compete with centralized exchanges like &l;a href=\&q;http://binance.com\&q;&g;Binance&l;/a&g; and &l;a href=\&q;https://www.coinbase.com/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Coinbase&l;/a&g;.

The real answer to why the banks&a;rsquo; dislike cryptocurrencies is most likely that they feel threatened. The rise of cryptocurrencies has exceeded all expectations and, while the concept is still very young, it does have potential to shake up the aging fiat system.

Using the &l;a href=\&q;https://www.bitstamp.net/\&q;&g;BitStamp&l;/a&g; Bitcoin-to-U.S.-Dollar (BTC/USD) pair, our team found the specific highs and lows of the past crashes dating back to January 2012. Utilizing a blue arrow, we highlight the percentage of value lost during each sell off. Lastly, we measured the length of each specific crash period by stating the number of days the correction ultimately lasted.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;This Is Not Bitcoin&a;rsquo;s First Rodeo, Top Crypto Has History Of Surviving Crashes&l;/strong&g;&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Despite the steep 70% losses during the latest cryptocurrency sell off, this is not an unusual event for Bitcoin. Since January 2012, there have been thirteen major corrections or crashes in Bitcoin, including this latest rout. Losses have been as minimal as 30% and as severe as 87% during these Bitcoin panics. Compared to its past events, this latest correction was not even as severe or painful as it has been in the past.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;The latest correction took place between December 17, 2017 and February 6, 2018, or 48 days, in which 70% of Bitcoin value was lost. However, if you look at the period between April 10, 2013 and April 12, 2013, Bitcoin lost an astounding 83% of its value over a three-day period. Talk about a panic! The point is that crashes have become relatively common throughout the cryptocurrency market, which is known for its swift volatility. It is important to turn to data and the facts in times of turmoil, rather than relying on one&a;rsquo;s emotions.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Here is a breakdown of the visual, showing each of the corrections in Bitcoin by date of occurrence. It will also include the percent of value loss and the length of the correction in number of days:&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1.

History shows that the top cryptocurrency has sustained much more rapid losses during a shorter period of time over the course of the past several years, yet it has not discouraged long-term investors. Regulatory crackdown fears seem to be main source of the latest crash, but the recent cryptocurrency regulatory hearing before the &l;a href=\&q;https://news.bitcoin.com/senate-releases-testimonies-ahead-of-crypto-hearing/\&q;&g;U.S. Senate&l;/a&g; struck a much brighter tone than crypto traders had anticipated. This shows that fears of regulators attempting to shut down the cryptocurrency market are overblown. In the end, cryptocurrency is still a very relatively new concept that will have its highs and lows, but its resilience in the face of uncertainty has been nothing short of incredible.&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/bitcoin-all-major-crashes&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;Visualizing the History of Bitcoin Crashes: Are Hodlers Prepared for the Next Bull Run? https://howmuch.net/articles/bitcoin-all-major-crashes via @howmuch_net #dataviz #Bitcoin #bitcoincrash #cryptocurrency #Crypto #cryptocurrencynews #HODL #HODLer &q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;Visualizing the History of Bitcoin Crashes: Are Hodlers Prepared for the Next Bull Run?&q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;While the latest crash has been painful, it is best to step back and assess the current state of Bitcoin relative to its past.

In order to more clearly depict the market cap growth during the time period, we used a green color scale ranging from light to dark shade. The darker the green background on each square, the larger the market capitalization. Conversely, lighter shades represent smaller market caps.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;Bitcoin Still Top Dog, But Market Cap Dominance In Downtrend&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;The &a;ldquo;grandfather of cryptocurrency,&a;rdquo; Bitcoin, has single-handed brought the crypto market to where it is today.

However, the &l;a href=\&q;https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;&a;ldquo;grandfather&a;rdquo;&l;/a&g; is getting old as other altcoins continue to see massive growth and influence within the emerging industry. In January 2014, Bitcoin&a;rsquo;s market cap was $10.20 billion, which represented 89% of the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies. As of January 2018, Bitcoin&a;rsquo;s market cap has skyrocketed to $192 billion, but now only represents 33.40% of the overall cryptocurrency industry&a;rsquo;s market cap.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;As cryptocurrencies were continuing to ride out the final stages of its first bull market in January 2014, only four coins were valued above $100 million dollars. By 2015, the market saw a steep crash, which resulted in only two cryptos above the $100 million mark in the top ten. The market reloaded in 2016 before leading to the start of the current bull run. In January 2017, the crypto market saw a record seven coins above the $100 million mark, but only Bitcoin was still in the billions club. After cryptos began going mainstream in late 2017, a face-melting rally began which propelled all top ten of the largest cryptocurrencies into the billion-dollar market cap club.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Here is a breakdown visual, based on the total size of market cap of the top ten cryptocurrencies between January 2014 and January 2018:&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;- January 2014: $11,356,979,703&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;- January 2015: $3,403,948,945&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;- January 2016: $6,283,781,652&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;- January 2017: $16,985,815,798&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;- January 2018: $455,573,149,014&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Overall, the total market cap of the top ten cryptocurrencies has risen from $11.36 billion to $455.57 billion between January 2014 and January 2018. This translates to an increase of $444.22 billion or 190.27% over the five-year period. Interestingly enough, the top three largest cryptocurrencies in January 2014 would be the only three to consistently make the top ten list each year: Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple. Ethereum busted onto the top ten scene by January 2016, and has surprised the entire community with its massive rise to be undisputed second largest cryptocurrency by market cap for the second year running.

There are currently 19 people in the world who own an equivalent of more than $350 million in crypto assets. The top owners of cryptocurrency in the world amassed their wealth in a variety of ways, but most are founders of large cryptocurrency projects and cryptocurrency exchange platforms. Others are either individual investors or part of investment groups and some have established very profitable cryptocurrency mining operations. The one thing that the richest in crypto have in common is that they are all the types to &a;ldquo;HODL&a;rdquo; (hold on for dear life), meaning that they hold on to their cryptocurrency through any downturns in the market and aren&a;rsquo;t quick to make crypto-to-crypto or crypto-to-fiat trades.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;&l;img alt=\&q;\&q; class=\&q;full-img img-responsive\&q; facebook-text=\&q;In the new era of cryptocurrency boom and bust, a few people have made astronomical profits.

No one else on the list even comes close to Larson&a;rsquo;s net worth. He personally owns 5.2 billion XRP. The amazing thing is that in early 2018 Ripple is only valued around $0.80 to $1.00 on average. If XRP rises to the price level of &l;a href=\&q;https://bitcoin.org/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;BTC&l;/a&g;, or even to the level of &l;a href=\&q;https://www.ethereum.org/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;ETH&l;/a&g;, Larson will very easily become the world&a;rsquo;s richest person and have the potential to be the world&a;rsquo;s first trillionaire.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;Demographics&l;/strong&g;&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Another notable thing to mention about this list is that not everyone made their fortunes early on. While some did invest in the early days of BTC (circa 2009 to 2012), lots of people won big by either working on the team at Ethereum or investing in ETH. This is significant because ETH&a;rsquo;s Initial Coin Offering (ICO) didn&a;rsquo;t take place until July 30, 2015.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;The world&a;rsquo;s largest owners of crypto are also very young. The average age of the 19 richest people in crypto is only 42; in contrast, the average age of the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans is 67. It&a;rsquo;s also interesting to note that there are only men on the crypto list, while two of the people at the top of the &l;a href=\&q;https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/richest-people-in-world-forbes/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;2018 list&l;/a&g; of the world&a;rsquo;s billionaires are women.&a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;Determining the Future of Crypto Wealth&l;/strong&g;&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;With price fluctuations and the rise of new cryptocurrencies, the rankings for the wealthiest people in crypto is likely to change a lot in the coming years. The crypto market price volatility in January and February 2018, for example, was much higher compared to blue chip stocks or commodities like gold. That means that the rankings could change drastically, even week to week.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;Promising new cryptos continue to emerge every day. Some have the technology and resources behind them to overtake the current breadwinners. On top of that, new, decentralized exchanges are emerging to compete with centralized exchanges like &l;a href=\&q;http://binance.com\&q;&g;Binance&l;/a&g; and &l;a href=\&q;https://www.coinbase.com/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Coinbase&l;/a&g;. These changes could catapult founders of new exchanges to the top of the crypto wealth rankings.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;As the cryptocurrency market continues to develop, it will be interesting to see which people emerge to become the wealthiest crypto owners of the future and who from the current Forbes list may fall out of the rankings.&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/the-richest-people-in-cryptocurrency&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;Meet the Wealthiest People in Crypto  https://howmuch.net/articles/the-richest-people-in-cryptocurrency via @howmuch_net @chrislarsensf @ethereumJoseph @CZ_BlNANCE @tylerwinklevoss @winklevoss @brian_armstrong @IOHK_Charles @VitalikButerin @novogratz @MatthewRoszak #dataviz #money #crypto #bitcoin #Billionaires #business&q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;Meet the Wealthiest People in Crypto&q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;In the new era of cryptocurrency boom and bust, a few people have made astronomical profits.

The real answer to why the banks&a;rsquo; dislike cryptocurrencies is most likely that they feel threatened. The rise of cryptocurrencies has exceeded all expectations and, while the concept is still very young, it does have potential to shake up the aging fiat system.

As of February 16, 2018, the total crypto market had a market cap of $470&a;nbsp;billion (as of February 16th, 2018), which exceeds the size of the United States&a;rsquo; largest bank, JPMorgan Chase.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Bitcoin&a;#39;s market cap alone is comparable to Bank of China&a;#39;s.&a;nbsp;The second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum, is comparable in size to Morgan Stanley.&a;nbsp;It is stats like these that have the global banking sector worried that cryptocurrencies are on track to make a serious impact on their operations.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;One of the most recent efforts to help slow the pace of crypto growth were announcements from several banks saying that customers could no longer &l;a href=\&q;https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2018/02/05/banks-banning-cryptocurrency-purchase-on-credit-cards-why/#744e8afd3cf9\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;purchase&l;/a&g; digital currency with their credit cards. &l;a href=\&q;https://cointelegraph.com/news/94-year-old-berkshire-hathaway-vp-its-disgusting-people-buy-bitcoin\&q;&g;Charlie Munger&l;/a&g;, the 94-year-old Berkshire Hathaway Vice President has called Bitcoin &l;em&g;&a;ldquo;totally asinine&a;rdquo; &l;/em&g;and says &l;em&g;&a;ldquo;it&a;rsquo;s disgusting&a;rdquo;&l;/em&g; that people buy cryptocurrency.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Overall, cryptocurrencies are seeing their size and value top even some of the largest financial institutions in the world.

Using the &l;a href=\&q;https://www.bitstamp.net/\&q;&g;BitStamp&l;/a&g; Bitcoin-to-U.S.-Dollar (BTC/USD) pair, our team found the specific highs and lows of the past crashes dating back to January 2012.

Since January 2012, there have been thirteen major corrections or crashes in Bitcoin, including this latest rout. Losses have been as minimal as 30% and as severe as 87% during these Bitcoin panics. Compared to its past events, this latest correction was not even as severe or painful as it has been in the past.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;The latest correction took place between December 17, 2017 and February 6, 2018, or 48 days, in which 70% of Bitcoin value was lost. However, if you look at the period between April 10, 2013 and April 12, 2013, Bitcoin lost an astounding 83% of its value over a three-day period. Talk about a panic! The point is that crashes have become relatively common throughout the cryptocurrency market, which is known for its swift volatility. It is important to turn to data and the facts in times of turmoil, rather than relying on one&a;rsquo;s emotions.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Here is a breakdown of the visual, showing each of the corrections in Bitcoin by date of occurrence.

History shows that the top cryptocurrency has sustained much more rapid losses during a shorter period of time over the course of the past several years, yet it has not discouraged long-term investors. Regulatory crackdown fears seem to be main source of the latest crash, but the recent cryptocurrency regulatory hearing before the &l;a href=\&q;https://news.bitcoin.com/senate-releases-testimonies-ahead-of-crypto-hearing/\&q;&g;U.S. Senate&l;/a&g; struck a much brighter tone than crypto traders had anticipated. This shows that fears of regulators attempting to shut down the cryptocurrency market are overblown. In the end, cryptocurrency is still a very relatively new concept that will have its highs and lows, but its resilience in the face of uncertainty has been nothing short of incredible.&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/bitcoin-all-major-crashes&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;Visualizing the History of Bitcoin Crashes: Are Hodlers Prepared for the Next Bull Run? https://howmuch.net/articles/bitcoin-all-major-crashes via @howmuch_net #dataviz #Bitcoin #bitcoincrash #cryptocurrency #Crypto #cryptocurrencynews #HODL #HODLer &q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;Visualizing the History of Bitcoin Crashes: Are Hodlers Prepared for the Next Bull Run?&q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;While the latest crash has been painful, it is best to step back and assess the current state of Bitcoin relative to its past.

Using January as the benchmark, we found the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap between the years of 2014 and 2018 from &l;a href=\&q;http://coinmarketcap.com/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;CoinMarketCap.com&l;/a&g;. In order to more clearly depict the market cap growth during the time period, we used a green color scale ranging from light to dark shade. The darker the green background on each square, the larger the market capitalization. Conversely, lighter shades represent smaller market caps.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;Bitcoin Still Top Dog, But Market Cap Dominance In Downtrend&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;The &a;ldquo;grandfather of cryptocurrency,&a;rdquo; Bitcoin, has single-handed brought the crypto market to where it is today. Without Bitcoin, there would be no cryptocurrency market. However, the &l;a href=\&q;https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;&a;ldquo;grandfather&a;rdquo;&l;/a&g; is getting old as other altcoins continue to see massive growth and influence within the emerging industry. In January 2014, Bitcoin&a;rsquo;s market cap was $10.20 billion, which represented 89% of the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies. As of January 2018, Bitcoin&a;rsquo;s market cap has skyrocketed to $192 billion, but now only represents 33.40% of the overall cryptocurrency industry&a;rsquo;s market cap.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;As cryptocurrencies were continuing to ride out the final stages of its first bull market in January 2014, only four coins were valued above $100 million dollars. By 2015, the market saw a steep crash, which resulted in only two cryptos above the $100 million mark in the top ten. The market reloaded in 2016 before leading to the start of the current bull run. In January 2017, the crypto market saw a record seven coins above the $100 million mark, but only Bitcoin was still in the billions club. After cryptos began going mainstream in late 2017, a face-melting rally began which propelled all top ten of the largest cryptocurrencies into the billion-dollar market cap club.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Here is a breakdown visual, based on the total size of market cap of the top ten cryptocurrencies between January 2014 and January 2018:&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;- January 2014: $11,356,979,703&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;- January 2015: $3,403,948,945&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;- January 2016: $6,283,781,652&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;- January 2017: $16,985,815,798&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;- January 2018: $455,573,149,014&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Overall, the total market cap of the top ten cryptocurrencies has risen from $11.36 billion to $455.57 billion between January 2014 and January 2018. This translates to an increase of $444.22 billion or 190.27% over the five-year period. Interestingly enough, the top three largest cryptocurrencies in January 2014 would be the only three to consistently make the top ten list each year: Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple. Ethereum busted onto the top ten scene by January 2016, and has surprised the entire community with its massive rise to be undisputed second largest cryptocurrency by market cap for the second year running. Overall, each year brings new revelations and insight into the state of the cryptocurrency market.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Data: &l;a href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/sources/top-10-cryptos-past-5-years\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Table 1.1&a;nbsp;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/top-10-cryptos-past-5-years&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;Visualizing The Meteoric Rise Of Cryptocurrency in the Past 5 Years  https://howmuch.net/articles/top-10-cryptos-past-5-years via @howmuch_net #cryptocurrency #cryptocurrencynews #Cryptocurrencies #dataviz $BTC #Bitcoin $ETH #Ethereum $ltc #Litecoin $XRP #Ripple $NEO #NEOcoin $ADA #Cardano $EOS #EOS &q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;Visualizing The Meteoric Rise Of Cryptocurrency in the Past 5 Years&q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;The cryptocurrency’s meteoric rise has stunned the world and defied traditional laws of market behavior.

Using circle sizes, we mapped out geographical locations where Bitcoin ATMs are in operation. The larger the size of the circle, the greater total number of Bitcoin ATMs there are within the country. In addition, we used a light-to-dark color scheme in order to measure the ratio of Bitcoin ATMs to population. The smaller the circle, the fewer number of Bitcoin ATMs per 1 million people. On the other hand, the darker Bitcoin logos represent the greater number of Bitcoin ATMs available per million individuals.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;U.S. Has Greatest Number Of Bitcoin ATMs, Austria Has Largest Concentration&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;According the visual, the United States is home to greatest number of Bitcoin ATMs with 1,330 machines. However, Austria has the greatest concentration of Bitcoin ATMs per million people, which makes the country have some of the greatest accessibility to crypto funds in the world. With that said, North America dominates the Bitcoin ATM market, which accounts for 76.10% of the world&a;rsquo;s cryptocurrency machines. Europe is home to the second most Bitcoin ATMs in the world with 18.80% of the total market. As Asian governments have continued to crackdown on cryptocurrency with imposing bans or strict regulations, the continent has fallen to the third largest region with 2.50% of the Bitcoin ATM market.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Making up the bottom half of the Bitcoin ATM market is Australia, Central &a;amp; South America, and Africa. Australia accounts for 1.20% and Central &a;amp; South America make up 1.30% of the world&a;rsquo;s operational Bitcoin ATMs. While Africa has essentially no Bitcoin ATM coverage, with a meager 0.05% thanks to one machine located in Nigeria.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;In the future, Africa will likely adopt Bitcoin ATMs as the continent further discovers the potential benefits that could help &l;a href=\&q;https://pctechmag.com/2017/01/bitcoin-atms-have-yet-to-take-off-in-africa-why/\&q;&g;unlock&l;/a&g; economic growth.

Others are either individual investors or part of investment groups and some have established very profitable cryptocurrency mining operations. The one thing that the richest in crypto have in common is that they are all the types to &a;ldquo;HODL&a;rdquo; (hold on for dear life), meaning that they hold on to their cryptocurrency through any downturns in the market and aren&a;rsquo;t quick to make crypto-to-crypto or crypto-to-fiat trades.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;&l;img alt=\&q;\&q; class=\&q;full-img img-responsive\&q; facebook-text=\&q;In the new era of cryptocurrency boom and bust, a few people have made astronomical profits.

No one else on the list even comes close to Larson&a;rsquo;s net worth. He personally owns 5.2 billion XRP.

The average age of the 19 richest people in crypto is only 42; in contrast, the average age of the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans is 67. It&a;rsquo;s also interesting to note that there are only men on the crypto list, while two of the people at the top of the &l;a href=\&q;https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/richest-people-in-world-forbes/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;2018 list&l;/a&g; of the world&a;rsquo;s billionaires are women.&a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;Determining the Future of Crypto Wealth&l;/strong&g;&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;With price fluctuations and the rise of new cryptocurrencies, the rankings for the wealthiest people in crypto is likely to change a lot in the coming years. The crypto market price volatility in January and February 2018, for example, was much higher compared to blue chip stocks or commodities like gold. That means that the rankings could change drastically, even week to week.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;Promising new cryptos continue to emerge every day. Some have the technology and resources behind them to overtake the current breadwinners. On top of that, new, decentralized exchanges are emerging to compete with centralized exchanges like &l;a href=\&q;http://binance.com\&q;&g;Binance&l;/a&g; and &l;a href=\&q;https://www.coinbase.com/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Coinbase&l;/a&g;. These changes could catapult founders of new exchanges to the top of the crypto wealth rankings.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;As the cryptocurrency market continues to develop, it will be interesting to see which people emerge to become the wealthiest crypto owners of the future and who from the current Forbes list may fall out of the rankings.&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/the-richest-people-in-cryptocurrency&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;Meet the Wealthiest People in Crypto  https://howmuch.net/articles/the-richest-people-in-cryptocurrency via @howmuch_net @chrislarsensf @ethereumJoseph @CZ_BlNANCE @tylerwinklevoss @winklevoss @brian_armstrong @IOHK_Charles @VitalikButerin @novogratz @MatthewRoszak #dataviz #money #crypto #bitcoin #Billionaires #business&q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;Meet the Wealthiest People in Crypto&q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;In the new era of cryptocurrency boom and bust, a few people have made astronomical profits.

The real answer to why the banks&a;rsquo; dislike cryptocurrencies is most likely that they feel threatened. The rise of cryptocurrencies has exceeded all expectations and, while the concept is still very young, it does have potential to shake up the aging fiat system.

On the left blue column, we have four banks listed from largest-to-smallest market caps: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of China, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley. Conversely, the right red column features the total cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, NEO, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, and Stellar.

As of February 16, 2018, the total crypto market had a market cap of $470&a;nbsp;billion (as of February 16th, 2018), which exceeds the size of the United States&a;rsquo; largest bank, JPMorgan Chase.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Bitcoin&a;#39;s market cap alone is comparable to Bank of China&a;#39;s.&a;nbsp;The second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum, is comparable in size to Morgan Stanley.&a;nbsp;It is stats like these that have the global banking sector worried that cryptocurrencies are on track to make a serious impact on their operations.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;One of the most recent efforts to help slow the pace of crypto growth were announcements from several banks saying that customers could no longer &l;a href=\&q;https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2018/02/05/banks-banning-cryptocurrency-purchase-on-credit-cards-why/#744e8afd3cf9\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;purchase&l;/a&g; digital currency with their credit cards. &l;a href=\&q;https://cointelegraph.com/news/94-year-old-berkshire-hathaway-vp-its-disgusting-people-buy-bitcoin\&q;&g;Charlie Munger&l;/a&g;, the 94-year-old Berkshire Hathaway Vice President has called Bitcoin &l;em&g;&a;ldquo;totally asinine&a;rdquo; &l;/em&g;and says &l;em&g;&a;ldquo;it&a;rsquo;s disgusting&a;rdquo;&l;/em&g; that people buy cryptocurrency.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Overall, cryptocurrencies are seeing their size and value top even some of the largest financial institutions in the world. This has caused banks to fight back and attempt to slow their growth. However, even banks clearly don&a;rsquo;t know what they really want.

Each box represents a specific time period in which the price of Bitcoin came under extreme selling pressure. Using the &l;a href=\&q;https://www.bitstamp.net/\&q;&g;BitStamp&l;/a&g; Bitcoin-to-U.S.-Dollar (BTC/USD) pair, our team found the specific highs and lows of the past crashes dating back to January 2012. Utilizing a blue arrow, we highlight the percentage of value lost during each sell off. Lastly, we measured the length of each specific crash period by stating the number of days the correction ultimately lasted.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;This Is Not Bitcoin&a;rsquo;s First Rodeo, Top Crypto Has History Of Surviving Crashes&l;/strong&g;&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Despite the steep 70% losses during the latest cryptocurrency sell off, this is not an unusual event for Bitcoin. Since January 2012, there have been thirteen major corrections or crashes in Bitcoin, including this latest rout. Losses have been as minimal as 30% and as severe as 87% during these Bitcoin panics. Compared to its past events, this latest correction was not even as severe or painful as it has been in the past.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;The latest correction took place between December 17, 2017 and February 6, 2018, or 48 days, in which 70% of Bitcoin value was lost. However, if you look at the period between April 10, 2013 and April 12, 2013, Bitcoin lost an astounding 83% of its value over a three-day period. Talk about a panic! The point is that crashes have become relatively common throughout the cryptocurrency market, which is known for its swift volatility. It is important to turn to data and the facts in times of turmoil, rather than relying on one&a;rsquo;s emotions.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Here is a breakdown of the visual, showing each of the corrections in Bitcoin by date of occurrence. It will also include the percent of value loss and the length of the correction in number of days:&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1.

November 30, 2013 &a;ndash; January 14, 2015, -87%, 411 Days&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;8. March 10, 2017 &a;ndash; March 25, 2017, -34%, 16 Days&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;9. May 25, 2017 &a;ndash; May 27, 2017, -33%, 3 Day&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;10. June 12, 2017 &a;ndash; July 16, 2017, -39%, 35 Days&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;11.&a;nbsp;September 2, 2017 &a;ndash; September 15, 2017, -40%, 14 Days&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;12.

History shows that the top cryptocurrency has sustained much more rapid losses during a shorter period of time over the course of the past several years, yet it has not discouraged long-term investors. Regulatory crackdown fears seem to be main source of the latest crash, but the recent cryptocurrency regulatory hearing before the &l;a href=\&q;https://news.bitcoin.com/senate-releases-testimonies-ahead-of-crypto-hearing/\&q;&g;U.S. Senate&l;/a&g; struck a much brighter tone than crypto traders had anticipated. This shows that fears of regulators attempting to shut down the cryptocurrency market are overblown. In the end, cryptocurrency is still a very relatively new concept that will have its highs and lows, but its resilience in the face of uncertainty has been nothing short of incredible.&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/bitcoin-all-major-crashes&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;Visualizing the History of Bitcoin Crashes: Are Hodlers Prepared for the Next Bull Run? https://howmuch.net/articles/bitcoin-all-major-crashes via @howmuch_net #dataviz #Bitcoin #bitcoincrash #cryptocurrency #Crypto #cryptocurrencynews #HODL #HODLer &q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;Visualizing the History of Bitcoin Crashes: Are Hodlers Prepared for the Next Bull Run?&q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;While the latest crash has been painful, it is best to step back and assess the current state of Bitcoin relative to its past.

By 2015, the market saw a steep crash, which resulted in only two cryptos above the $100 million mark in the top ten. The market reloaded in 2016 before leading to the start of the current bull run. In January 2017, the crypto market saw a record seven coins above the $100 million mark, but only Bitcoin was still in the billions club. After cryptos began going mainstream in late 2017, a face-melting rally began which propelled all top ten of the largest cryptocurrencies into the billion-dollar market cap club.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Here is a breakdown visual, based on the total size of market cap of the top ten cryptocurrencies between January 2014 and January 2018:&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;- January 2014: $11,356,979,703&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;- January 2015: $3,403,948,945&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;- January 2016: $6,283,781,652&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;- January 2017: $16,985,815,798&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;- January 2018: $455,573,149,014&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Overall, the total market cap of the top ten cryptocurrencies has risen from $11.36 billion to $455.57 billion between January 2014 and January 2018. This translates to an increase of $444.22 billion or 190.27% over the five-year period. Interestingly enough, the top three largest cryptocurrencies in January 2014 would be the only three to consistently make the top ten list each year: Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple. Ethereum busted onto the top ten scene by January 2016, and has surprised the entire community with its massive rise to be undisputed second largest cryptocurrency by market cap for the second year running. Overall, each year brings new revelations and insight into the state of the cryptocurrency market.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Data: &l;a href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/sources/top-10-cryptos-past-5-years\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Table 1.1&a;nbsp;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/top-10-cryptos-past-5-years&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;Visualizing The Meteoric Rise Of Cryptocurrency in the Past 5 Years  https://howmuch.net/articles/top-10-cryptos-past-5-years via @howmuch_net #cryptocurrency #cryptocurrencynews #Cryptocurrencies #dataviz $BTC #Bitcoin $ETH #Ethereum $ltc #Litecoin $XRP #Ripple $NEO #NEOcoin $ADA #Cardano $EOS #EOS &q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;Visualizing The Meteoric Rise Of Cryptocurrency in the Past 5 Years&q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;The cryptocurrency’s meteoric rise has stunned the world and defied traditional laws of market behavior.

Using circle sizes, we mapped out geographical locations where Bitcoin ATMs are in operation. The larger the size of the circle, the greater total number of Bitcoin ATMs there are within the country. In addition, we used a light-to-dark color scheme in order to measure the ratio of Bitcoin ATMs to population. The smaller the circle, the fewer number of Bitcoin ATMs per 1 million people. On the other hand, the darker Bitcoin logos represent the greater number of Bitcoin ATMs available per million individuals.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;U.S. Has Greatest Number Of Bitcoin ATMs, Austria Has Largest Concentration&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;According the visual, the United States is home to greatest number of Bitcoin ATMs with 1,330 machines. However, Austria has the greatest concentration of Bitcoin ATMs per million people, which makes the country have some of the greatest accessibility to crypto funds in the world. With that said, North America dominates the Bitcoin ATM market, which accounts for 76.10% of the world&a;rsquo;s cryptocurrency machines. Europe is home to the second most Bitcoin ATMs in the world with 18.80% of the total market. As Asian governments have continued to crackdown on cryptocurrency with imposing bans or strict regulations, the continent has fallen to the third largest region with 2.50% of the Bitcoin ATM market.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Making up the bottom half of the Bitcoin ATM market is Australia, Central &a;amp; South America, and Africa. Australia accounts for 1.20% and Central &a;amp; South America make up 1.30% of the world&a;rsquo;s operational Bitcoin ATMs. While Africa has essentially no Bitcoin ATM coverage, with a meager 0.05% thanks to one machine located in Nigeria.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;In the future, Africa will likely adopt Bitcoin ATMs as the continent further discovers the potential benefits that could help &l;a href=\&q;https://pctechmag.com/2017/01/bitcoin-atms-have-yet-to-take-off-in-africa-why/\&q;&g;unlock&l;/a&g; economic growth.

Abodo adopted the data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which regularly collects a variety of information about the population, including the age of homeowners, the estimated value of their homes, and how long it would take to accumulate a 20% down payment. Our numbers are from 2015. We then overlaid this information across metro areas with bubbles representing the portion of millennial homeowners in each market: the bigger the bubble, the more millennial homeowners there are. We also color-coded each bubble to represent the median value of their homes&a;mdash;dark red circles mean the homes are worth over $500k, and dark blue means under $200k. This gives you a quick snapshot of the overall economy and the housing market.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;The first trend you can see on the map is a clustering of red circles on both the West Coast and along the Northeast. The most expensive city in the country for millennials is San Jose, CA, where the average millennial buys a home worth $737,077. Seattle, WA in the Northwest is also relatively expensive at $342,769. These are population-dense areas with&l;a href=\&q;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/05/business/dealbook/tech-stocks-boom-but-some-stock-pickers-are-wary.html\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; booming&l;/a&g; tech sectors. At the other end of the spectrum, you can see clusters of blue bubbles across the Midwest in old manufacturing cities like Detroit, MI ($148,404) and Cleveland, OH ($160,251). Memphis, TN is the cheapest place for millennials at $142,795. Southern states like Texas and Florida are also relatively affordable thanks in large part to their suburban sprawl, which&l;a href=\&q;https://www.zillow.com/research/2018-predictions-17217/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Zillow&l;/a&g; predicts will expand next year.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;It&a;rsquo;s no surprise that homes are more expensive in California (think Silicon Valley) than the industrial heartland, but consider how homeownership rates change based on affordability. The red bubbles all tend to be smaller than the blue bubbles. This means that as homes get more expensive, millennials become increasingly unable to afford them. It&a;rsquo;s not like there&a;rsquo;s a surplus of ultra-rich millennials buying up all the houses in California and New York. Millennials are just as sensitive to high prices as everyone else.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Let&a;rsquo;s break the map down into a &l;strong&g;top ten list of the urban areas with the highest rates of millennial homeownership&l;/strong&g;, combined with the average price of their home.

We started first by taking data from the&l;a href=\&q;https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_15_5YR_S1903&a;amp;prodType=table\&q;&g; U.S. Census Bureau&l;/a&g; to find out the median income for people in 98 of the biggest cities in the U.S. Using a 40-hour work week as the standard, we calculated an average hourly rate. This levels the playing field between all the different types of jobs in the country (some people make a salary, others are paid by the hour).&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Next, thanks to&l;a href=\&q;https://www.zillow.com/mortgage-rates/\&q;&g; Zillow&l;/a&g;, we figured out the median housing price for each city and determined a monthly mortgage payment.&l;a href=\&q;http://abcnews.go.com/Business/economists-explain-homebuyers-flock-30-year-fixed-mortgage/story?id=20348442\&q;&g; Most people&l;/a&g; take out a 30-year loan, so that&a;rsquo;s what we used too. Finally, we compared the two numbers to see how long you&a;rsquo;d have to work to make that mortgage payment each month. We color-coded and mapped the results in 3-D, revealing a couple of key insights into the housing market and income inequality in the U.S.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;The red bars represent places where you have to work the most hours to keep the roof over your head. In cities like New York, Los Angeles, Miami, and San Francisco, you put in more than 100 hours to make enough money just to pay for housing. That&a;rsquo;s longer than two-and-a-half weeks, meaning well over 50% of your take-home pay! Not surprisingly, unaffordable places are all located on the either coastline. In fact, 8 of the 10 most expensive places are all located in California.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;Top 10 Cities Where you Have to Work the Most Hours to Afford a Home&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1. New York, NY - 113 hours&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;2. Los Angeles, CA - 112 hours&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;3. Miami, FL - 109 hours&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;4.

San Jose, CA -&a;nbsp; 74 hours&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Although most of the expensive places to live are concentrated on the coasts, you can find affordable housing almost anywhere else in the country. The best places tend to be old manufacturing cities like Toledo, OH and Memphis, TN (17 and 18 hours, respectively). That&a;rsquo;s right&a;mdash;you don&a;rsquo;t need to work past lunch on Wednesday to earn enough money to make a mortgage payment in the Midwest.

The bigger the blue dot and the larger the red circle, the more expensive it is to become a property owner. Small circles and dots likewise indicate a very low cost of purchasing property. The home values are from the U.S. &l;a href=\&q;https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Census Bureau&a;rsquo;s 2015 American Consumer Survey&l;/a&g;, and the numbers behind the land values come from the&l;a href=\&q;https://www.bea.gov/papers/pdf/new-estimates-of-value-of-land-of-the-united-states-larson.pdf\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Bureau of Economic Analysis&l;/a&g;.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Several things stand out in our illustration. An acre of land is much more valuable in the Northeast compared to any other part of the country. This is partly because the Eastern seaboard is a very densely populated area with several large cities, most notably New York. It is also a historical artifact that Europeans settled New England first and then moved west, meaning that New York and Massachusetts have some of the oldest modern structures anywhere in the U.S. In other words, Eastern cities are a lot older than Midwestern cities, so there isn&a;rsquo;t a lot of farmland for suburban expansion anymore.&a;nbsp;We should also mention that in terms of geographic size, these are some of the smallest states in the country. Matter of fact, the three states where the cost of an acre of land &l;strong&g;is greater than the median price of a house&l;/strong&g; are all located on the East Coast, and they happen to be some of the smallest states in the Union (Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Jersey).&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Median home values (the red circles) are a different and more complicated story. California has the most expensive houses by far ($449,100). Oregon and Washington boast similarly high housing valuations as well ($264,100 and $284,000, respectively). It is also expensive to buy a home on the East Coast with six out of the top ten states with the most expensive median home values.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;But there&a;rsquo;s a noticeable dip in both housing and land prices in southern and midwestern states. Prices slowly rise the further you move from east to west. This highlights unique economic developments over the last several years, including the boom in oil exploration in&l;a href=\&q;http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-sej-north-dakota-oil-town-20160111-story.html\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; North Dakota&l;/a&g; and the growth of Western cities thanks to young people,&l;a href=\&q;http://www.metrodenver.org/research-reports/millennial-study/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; like Denver&l;/a&g;.

Abodo adopted the data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which regularly collects a variety of information about the population, including the age of homeowners, the estimated value of their homes, and how long it would take to accumulate a 20% down payment. Our numbers are from 2015. We then overlaid this information across metro areas with bubbles representing the portion of millennial homeowners in each market: the bigger the bubble, the more millennial homeowners there are. We also color-coded each bubble to represent the median value of their homes&a;mdash;dark red circles mean the homes are worth over $500k, and dark blue means under $200k. This gives you a quick snapshot of the overall economy and the housing market.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;The first trend you can see on the map is a clustering of red circles on both the West Coast and along the Northeast. The most expensive city in the country for millennials is San Jose, CA, where the average millennial buys a home worth $737,077. Seattle, WA in the Northwest is also relatively expensive at $342,769. These are population-dense areas with&l;a href=\&q;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/05/business/dealbook/tech-stocks-boom-but-some-stock-pickers-are-wary.html\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; booming&l;/a&g; tech sectors. At the other end of the spectrum, you can see clusters of blue bubbles across the Midwest in old manufacturing cities like Detroit, MI ($148,404) and Cleveland, OH ($160,251). Memphis, TN is the cheapest place for millennials at $142,795. Southern states like Texas and Florida are also relatively affordable thanks in large part to their suburban sprawl, which&l;a href=\&q;https://www.zillow.com/research/2018-predictions-17217/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Zillow&l;/a&g; predicts will expand next year.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;It&a;rsquo;s no surprise that homes are more expensive in California (think Silicon Valley) than the industrial heartland, but consider how homeownership rates change based on affordability. The red bubbles all tend to be smaller than the blue bubbles. This means that as homes get more expensive, millennials become increasingly unable to afford them. It&a;rsquo;s not like there&a;rsquo;s a surplus of ultra-rich millennials buying up all the houses in California and New York. Millennials are just as sensitive to high prices as everyone else.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Let&a;rsquo;s break the map down into a &l;strong&g;top ten list of the urban areas with the highest rates of millennial homeownership&l;/strong&g;, combined with the average price of their home. A full 42% of the millennials living in Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN own their own home, the highest rate in the country.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1.

And there&a;rsquo;s a lot to consider when buying your first home, but one thing other than affordability to keep in mind is how many other millennials are in the same situation.

How does this work? Suppose you make an offer on a house. The current owner is also probably on the market, and he or she likely has a contingent offer on another house. This sets off a chain reaction throughout the economy. Millennial homeownership rates are therefore an easy way to judge the economic vitality of any given area.

We started first by taking data from the&l;a href=\&q;https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_15_5YR_S1903&a;amp;prodType=table\&q;&g; U.S. Census Bureau&l;/a&g; to find out the median income for people in 98 of the biggest cities in the U.S. Using a 40-hour work week as the standard, we calculated an average hourly rate. This levels the playing field between all the different types of jobs in the country (some people make a salary, others are paid by the hour).&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Next, thanks to&l;a href=\&q;https://www.zillow.com/mortgage-rates/\&q;&g; Zillow&l;/a&g;, we figured out the median housing price for each city and determined a monthly mortgage payment.&l;a href=\&q;http://abcnews.go.com/Business/economists-explain-homebuyers-flock-30-year-fixed-mortgage/story?id=20348442\&q;&g; Most people&l;/a&g; take out a 30-year loan, so that&a;rsquo;s what we used too. Finally, we compared the two numbers to see how long you&a;rsquo;d have to work to make that mortgage payment each month. We color-coded and mapped the results in 3-D, revealing a couple of key insights into the housing market and income inequality in the U.S.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;The red bars represent places where you have to work the most hours to keep the roof over your head. In cities like New York, Los Angeles, Miami, and San Francisco, you put in more than 100 hours to make enough money just to pay for housing. That&a;rsquo;s longer than two-and-a-half weeks, meaning well over 50% of your take-home pay! Not surprisingly, unaffordable places are all located on the either coastline. In fact, 8 of the 10 most expensive places are all located in California.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;Top 10 Cities Where you Have to Work the Most Hours to Afford a Home&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1.

The best places tend to be old manufacturing cities like Toledo, OH and Memphis, TN (17 and 18 hours, respectively). That&a;rsquo;s right&a;mdash;you don&a;rsquo;t need to work past lunch on Wednesday to earn enough money to make a mortgage payment in the Midwest.

The bigger the blue dot and the larger the red circle, the more expensive it is to become a property owner. Small circles and dots likewise indicate a very low cost of purchasing property. The home values are from the U.S. &l;a href=\&q;https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Census Bureau&a;rsquo;s 2015 American Consumer Survey&l;/a&g;, and the numbers behind the land values come from the&l;a href=\&q;https://www.bea.gov/papers/pdf/new-estimates-of-value-of-land-of-the-united-states-larson.pdf\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Bureau of Economic Analysis&l;/a&g;.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Several things stand out in our illustration. An acre of land is much more valuable in the Northeast compared to any other part of the country. This is partly because the Eastern seaboard is a very densely populated area with several large cities, most notably New York. It is also a historical artifact that Europeans settled New England first and then moved west, meaning that New York and Massachusetts have some of the oldest modern structures anywhere in the U.S. In other words, Eastern cities are a lot older than Midwestern cities, so there isn&a;rsquo;t a lot of farmland for suburban expansion anymore.&a;nbsp;We should also mention that in terms of geographic size, these are some of the smallest states in the country. Matter of fact, the three states where the cost of an acre of land &l;strong&g;is greater than the median price of a house&l;/strong&g; are all located on the East Coast, and they happen to be some of the smallest states in the Union (Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Jersey).&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Median home values (the red circles) are a different and more complicated story. California has the most expensive houses by far ($449,100). Oregon and Washington boast similarly high housing valuations as well ($264,100 and $284,000, respectively). It is also expensive to buy a home on the East Coast with six out of the top ten states with the most expensive median home values.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;But there&a;rsquo;s a noticeable dip in both housing and land prices in southern and midwestern states. Prices slowly rise the further you move from east to west. This highlights unique economic developments over the last several years, including the boom in oil exploration in&l;a href=\&q;http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-sej-north-dakota-oil-town-20160111-story.html\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; North Dakota&l;/a&g; and the growth of Western cities thanks to young people,&l;a href=\&q;http://www.metrodenver.org/research-reports/millennial-study/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; like Denver&l;/a&g;.

So, naturally, how big of a house can you afford with a mortgage of $200,400? Our visualization answers this question on a sliding color-coded scale. We broke each state into a grid with 25 boxes, representing 2,500 square feet&a;mdash;that&a;rsquo;s a large home with at least 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. Green boxes indicate affordability and orange and red boxes mean it&a;rsquo;s expensive. We then graphed how much house you can purchase with exactly $200,400.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;The results highlight the enormous differences between housing values in the U.S. It is all about location, location, location. In the Hoosier State, your $200k mortgage can purchase 2,330-sq. ft., but in Washington D.C. only 497 sq. ft. That&a;rsquo;s the difference between a large home and a cramped studio apartment.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;The fact that Washington D.C. boasts the most expensive housing market in the coutry should come as no surprise to observers of the economy in the aftermath of the recession. While real estate market crashed in other metro areas, it&l;a href=\&q;http://www.economist.com/node/18561085\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; kept rising&l;/a&g; in Washington D.C.

Abodo adopted the data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which regularly collects a variety of information about the population, including the age of homeowners, the estimated value of their homes, and how long it would take to accumulate a 20% down payment. Our numbers are from 2015. We then overlaid this information across metro areas with bubbles representing the portion of millennial homeowners in each market: the bigger the bubble, the more millennial homeowners there are. We also color-coded each bubble to represent the median value of their homes&a;mdash;dark red circles mean the homes are worth over $500k, and dark blue means under $200k. This gives you a quick snapshot of the overall economy and the housing market.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;The first trend you can see on the map is a clustering of red circles on both the West Coast and along the Northeast. The most expensive city in the country for millennials is San Jose, CA, where the average millennial buys a home worth $737,077. Seattle, WA in the Northwest is also relatively expensive at $342,769. These are population-dense areas with&l;a href=\&q;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/05/business/dealbook/tech-stocks-boom-but-some-stock-pickers-are-wary.html\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; booming&l;/a&g; tech sectors. At the other end of the spectrum, you can see clusters of blue bubbles across the Midwest in old manufacturing cities like Detroit, MI ($148,404) and Cleveland, OH ($160,251). Memphis, TN is the cheapest place for millennials at $142,795. Southern states like Texas and Florida are also relatively affordable thanks in large part to their suburban sprawl, which&l;a href=\&q;https://www.zillow.com/research/2018-predictions-17217/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Zillow&l;/a&g; predicts will expand next year.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;It&a;rsquo;s no surprise that homes are more expensive in California (think Silicon Valley) than the industrial heartland, but consider how homeownership rates change based on affordability. The red bubbles all tend to be smaller than the blue bubbles. This means that as homes get more expensive, millennials become increasingly unable to afford them. It&a;rsquo;s not like there&a;rsquo;s a surplus of ultra-rich millennials buying up all the houses in California and New York. Millennials are just as sensitive to high prices as everyone else.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Let&a;rsquo;s break the map down into a &l;strong&g;top ten list of the urban areas with the highest rates of millennial homeownership&l;/strong&g;, combined with the average price of their home.

We started first by taking data from the&l;a href=\&q;https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_15_5YR_S1903&a;amp;prodType=table\&q;&g; U.S. Census Bureau&l;/a&g; to find out the median income for people in 98 of the biggest cities in the U.S. Using a 40-hour work week as the standard, we calculated an average hourly rate. This levels the playing field between all the different types of jobs in the country (some people make a salary, others are paid by the hour).&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Next, thanks to&l;a href=\&q;https://www.zillow.com/mortgage-rates/\&q;&g; Zillow&l;/a&g;, we figured out the median housing price for each city and determined a monthly mortgage payment.&l;a href=\&q;http://abcnews.go.com/Business/economists-explain-homebuyers-flock-30-year-fixed-mortgage/story?id=20348442\&q;&g; Most people&l;/a&g; take out a 30-year loan, so that&a;rsquo;s what we used too. Finally, we compared the two numbers to see how long you&a;rsquo;d have to work to make that mortgage payment each month. We color-coded and mapped the results in 3-D, revealing a couple of key insights into the housing market and income inequality in the U.S.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;The red bars represent places where you have to work the most hours to keep the roof over your head. In cities like New York, Los Angeles, Miami, and San Francisco, you put in more than 100 hours to make enough money just to pay for housing. That&a;rsquo;s longer than two-and-a-half weeks, meaning well over 50% of your take-home pay! Not surprisingly, unaffordable places are all located on the either coastline. In fact, 8 of the 10 most expensive places are all located in California.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;Top 10 Cities Where you Have to Work the Most Hours to Afford a Home&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1.

The bigger the blue dot and the larger the red circle, the more expensive it is to become a property owner. Small circles and dots likewise indicate a very low cost of purchasing property. The home values are from the U.S. &l;a href=\&q;https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Census Bureau&a;rsquo;s 2015 American Consumer Survey&l;/a&g;, and the numbers behind the land values come from the&l;a href=\&q;https://www.bea.gov/papers/pdf/new-estimates-of-value-of-land-of-the-united-states-larson.pdf\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Bureau of Economic Analysis&l;/a&g;.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Several things stand out in our illustration. An acre of land is much more valuable in the Northeast compared to any other part of the country. This is partly because the Eastern seaboard is a very densely populated area with several large cities, most notably New York. It is also a historical artifact that Europeans settled New England first and then moved west, meaning that New York and Massachusetts have some of the oldest modern structures anywhere in the U.S. In other words, Eastern cities are a lot older than Midwestern cities, so there isn&a;rsquo;t a lot of farmland for suburban expansion anymore.&a;nbsp;We should also mention that in terms of geographic size, these are some of the smallest states in the country. Matter of fact, the three states where the cost of an acre of land &l;strong&g;is greater than the median price of a house&l;/strong&g; are all located on the East Coast, and they happen to be some of the smallest states in the Union (Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Jersey).&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Median home values (the red circles) are a different and more complicated story. California has the most expensive houses by far ($449,100). Oregon and Washington boast similarly high housing valuations as well ($264,100 and $284,000, respectively). It is also expensive to buy a home on the East Coast with six out of the top ten states with the most expensive median home values.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;But there&a;rsquo;s a noticeable dip in both housing and land prices in southern and midwestern states. Prices slowly rise the further you move from east to west. This highlights unique economic developments over the last several years, including the boom in oil exploration in&l;a href=\&q;http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-sej-north-dakota-oil-town-20160111-story.html\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; North Dakota&l;/a&g; and the growth of Western cities thanks to young people,&l;a href=\&q;http://www.metrodenver.org/research-reports/millennial-study/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; like Denver&l;/a&g;.

So, naturally, how big of a house can you afford with a mortgage of $200,400? Our visualization answers this question on a sliding color-coded scale. We broke each state into a grid with 25 boxes, representing 2,500 square feet&a;mdash;that&a;rsquo;s a large home with at least 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. Green boxes indicate affordability and orange and red boxes mean it&a;rsquo;s expensive.

In the Hoosier State, your $200k mortgage can purchase 2,330-sq. ft., but in Washington D.C. only 497 sq. ft. That&a;rsquo;s the difference between a large home and a cramped studio apartment.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;The fact that Washington D.C. boasts the most expensive housing market in the coutry should come as no surprise to observers of the economy in the aftermath of the recession.

Fortune took the largest companies in the world in every industry, and surveyed executives and analysts asking them to rate the strength of each one. We took the top 50 all-star companies and placed the logos of each one in a circle within the headquartered country. The size of the circle corresponds to the company&a;rsquo;s total market capitalization, with the largest circles representing companies valued at over $500B. We then color-coded each one by industry, and grouped the ones belonging to the same industries together. The result is a kaleidoscopic map of the most admired companies in the world that lets you quickly identify several trends about reputations in the corporate world.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;First off, companies headquartered in the United States dominate the list, partly because Fortune&a;rsquo;s methodology favored American companies, but also because the U.S. simply has the&l;a href=\&q;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=US&a;amp;view=map&a;amp;year_high_desc=true\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; largest economy&l;/a&g; in the world. Within the U.S., Apple totally dominates with a market cap of $905B, terrifyingly close to becoming the&l;a href=\&q;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-03-01/apple-is-going-to-be-the-first-trillion-dollar-company\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; first trillion-dollar company&l;/a&g; in history. Amazon ($737B) and Microsoft ($735B) also stand out in the computer industry. Interestingly, the fourth largest company on our list is Facebook, but its market cap is significantly less at only $443B. The companies start to get crowded below Facebook&a;rsquo;s valuation, as the map clearly demonstrates. In other words, the biggest companies are really, really big compared to everyone else.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;The map also illustrates how the most admired companies come from a variety of different industries. From Internet companies to hotel chains and petroleum manufacturers, it is fair to say that a company can build a solid reputation regardless of industry. Many sectors also have more than one company making the list too, suggesting that a positive reputation can rub off onto similar competitors.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;One more trend is worth pointing out. Almost all the companies on the list specialize in one industry. The exception is Berkshire Hathaway, which is listed as the only insurance company on our viz. That&a;rsquo;s because they own&l;a href=\&q;https://www.geico.com/about/corporate/corporate-ownership/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; GEICO&l;/a&g; as well as a few other insurance companies. In reality, Berkshire is a giant holding company with vested interests across a &l;a href=\&q;https://www.cnbc.com/berkshire-hathaway-portfolio/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;variety of different industries&l;/a&g;. Amazon, Apple and Google might be headed down a similar path, but they aren&a;rsquo;t quite there yet. Building a good reputation requires a killer business model with mass appeal in a single industry.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;Top 10 Most Admired Companies&a;nbsp;&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1. Apple: Computers/Software/IT, $905B&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;2. Amazon: Internet, $7367B&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;3.

Google is the second youngest with 20 years of experience organizing the world&a;rsquo;s knowledge. Every other company has a longstanding legacy of product innovation and customer service. It looks like Warren Buffett was probably right with how long it takes to build a good reputation.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Data: &l;a href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/sources/world-most-admired-companies-2018\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Table 1.1&l;/a&g;&a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/world-most-admired-companies-2018&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;Visualizing the World&s;s Most Admired Companies  https://howmuch.net/articles/world-most-admired-companies-2018 via @howmuch_net #dataviz #business #money @Apple @amazon @Microsoft @facebook @jpmorgan @Google @Visa @exxonmobil @CocaCola @intel &q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;Visualizing the World&s;s Most Admired Companies &q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;Every company wants to cultivate a desirable brand commanding respect and attention.

Most experts recommend keeping these dollars immediately available, and a savings accounts provides the liquidity to access the cash on a moment&a;rsquo;s notice. So which banks have the most deposits on hand? Figuring out the answer to that question led us to create our new map.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;&l;img alt=\&q;\&q; class=\&q;full-img img-responsive\&q; facebook-text=\&q;The local bank is a cornerstone of small towns, but in an age of global finance some banks now have hundreds of billions in deposits.

First, GOBankingRates figured out the largest bank headquartered in each state.&a;nbsp;It is important to pause and consider GOBankingRates&a;rsquo; methodology in putting the data together. They looked at official &l;a href=\&q;https://www.fdic.gov\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;FDIC&l;/a&g; documents to find the headquarter location and deposit totals from 2017, which can often be different from what one might expect. For example, Wells Fargo has its world headquarters in San Francisco, but the bank&a;rsquo;s U.S. operates are actually headquartered in Sioux Falls, SD. Same thing goes for Charles Schwab&a;mdash;the investment company is located in San Francisco, but the bank is kept separately in Nevada. And if you watched the&l;a href=\&q;https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/02/02/u-s-bank-stadium-ready-super-bowl-closeup/300621002/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Super Bowl&l;/a&g;, you know U.S. Bank is associated with Minneapolis.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;In terms of general trends, our map demonstrates how almost none of the states with a large bank (over $50B in deposits in a single market) are located in the Midwest. The two exceptions are U.S. Bank which controls the top spot in Ohio ($62.4B) and Wells Fargo in South Dakota&a;mdash;as if South Dakota even belongs in the Midwest. All the other banks headquartered across the country&a;rsquo;s midsection are relatively small in terms of deposit size.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;In fact, the smallest banks tend to be in states with comparably small populations. Wyoming takes last place with the only institution under a billion in deposits, Hilltop National Bank ($0.6B), followed by Idaho with D.L. Evans Bank ($1.1B). Even the First National Bank of Alaska is more than twice as big ($2.5B). If these banks want to grow deposits, they need to move to larger population centers.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Here are the ten largest banks in terms of deposits held within a single market ($ billion), together with their total holdings company wide ($ billion).&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1. Wells Fargo Bank: South Dakota $264.9 inside market and $1,200 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;2. Bank of America: North Carolina $171.9 inside market and $1,300 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;3. Charles Schwab Bank: Nevada $162.4 inside market and $162.4 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;4. Ally Bank: Utah $86.3 inside market and $86.3 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;5. MUFG Union Bank: California $80.6 inside market and $86.8 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;6. TD Bank: Delaware $79.7 inside market and $227.1 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;7. USAA Federal Savings Bank: Texas $72 inside market and $72 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;8. Capital One Bank: Virginia $66.2 inside market and $66.2 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;9.&a;nbsp;U.S. Bank: Ohio $62.4 inside market and $329.5 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;10.&a;nbsp;SunTrust Bank: $54.3 inside market and $162.7 in total&a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;All this goes to show that the world of bank deposits is complicated. Never assume the largest banks are always located in booming metropolises, as Wells Fargo and Northfield Savings Bank demonstrate. And yet the general trend remains undeniable&a;mdash;having a large population only helps to grow the size of a bank&a;rsquo;s deposits too.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;Data: &l;a href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/sources/largest-bank-in-every-state\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Table 1.1&a;nbsp;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/largest-bank-in-every-state&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;The Biggest Banks for Your Buck in Every State   https://howmuch.net/articles/largest-bank-in-every-state via @howmuch_net #Banking #money #business #USA #Dataviz &q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;The Biggest Banks for Your Buck in Every State &q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;The local bank is a cornerstone of small towns, but in an age of global finance some banks now have hundreds of billions in deposits.

They calculate the market value for the brand names of the most popular companies in the world, which includes the hard dollar value of a company&a;rsquo;s assets as well as its trademarks, patents, and what accountants call &a;ldquo;goodwill.&a;rdquo; Then, Brand Finance scores the overall the strength of a company&a;rsquo;s brand based on how it is perceived by customers, employees and other stakeholders. We created our map by adjusting the size of each country according to the market value of its most valuable brand, and we color-coded each country based on its strength.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;We did this same type of analysis&l;a href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/articles/most-valuable-brands-2017\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; last year&l;/a&g;. It&a;rsquo;s interesting to flip between 2017 and 2018 versions of the map because it quickly demonstrates how the economy has changed in the past year. Amazon surpassed Google to become the most valuable company in the United States at $150.8B, thanks in large part to the&l;a href=\&q;https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/06/why-amazon-bought-whole-foods/530652/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; acquisition&l;/a&g; of Whole Foods. And before Google, the most valuable American brand was Apple&a;mdash;meaning the top spot has changed 3 years in a row. Perhaps Amazon shouldn&a;rsquo;t get too comfortable, unless they get those&l;a href=\&q;https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Prime-Air/b?node=8037720011\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Prime Air drones&l;/a&g; to take off soon.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Europe also has several highly valuable and strong brands, including Mercedes-Benz ($43.9B) from Germany and Shell ($39.4) in the Netherlands. The strongest brand on our map is Lego at 90.6, although the brand itself is worth comparatively less ($7.6B). They clearly have the market for plastic building brick toys cornered.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;China has the second strongest brand in the world in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) at 90.3, a multinational banking company with a huge portfolio. ICBC puts China in elite territory with a very high market value ($59.2B). Another bank based in Russia, Sberbank, also cracks that 90-point threshold, coming in at 90.1 with a respectable market value of $11.6B.&l;a href=\&q;http://fortune.com/2015/07/22/china-global-500-government-owned/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; ICBC&l;/a&g; and&l;a href=\&q;https://www.reuters.com/article/russia-sberbank-dividends/russia-discussing-dividend-hike-at-state-owned-sberbank-sources-idUSL8N1NF9G7\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Sberbank&l;/a&g; are both controlled by their respective governments, which makes Lego&a;rsquo;s accomplishment all the more impressive.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;That brings up a larger point. Our map has a wide variety of different companies on it, but they generally fall into three categories: consumer brands, legacy manufacturers, and banks. There just isn&a;rsquo;t the same dominance in other industries like insurance, health care or even brick and mortar stores.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;Top 10 Countries with the Most Valuable Brands in the World&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1. United States: Amazon at $150.8B and 79.7&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;2. South Korea: Samsung at $92.3B and 89.5&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;3. China: ICBC at $59.2B and 90.3&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;4. Germany: Mercedes-Benz at $43.9B and 79.7&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;5.

Switzerland: Nestl&a;eacute; at $19.4B and 83.4&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;The main take away from our analysis is that a brand&a;rsquo;s value and strength are not necessarily correlated. Sure, Amazon&a;rsquo;s market dominance contributes to its brand, but the strongest brand (Lego) doesn&a;rsquo;t even break the top ten in value. In fact, three countries in the top ten have brands with scores in the 70s, which suggests that the list will only keep changing next year.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Data: &l;a href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/sources/most-valuable-brands-2018\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Table 1.1&a;nbsp;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/most-valuable-brands-2018&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;Mapping the World&s;s Most Valuable Brands in 2018 https://howmuch.net/articles/most-valuable-brands-2018 via @howmuch_net #dataviz #business #brands #USA #Money @amazon @MercedesBenz @Samsung @Toyota @BP_plc @ZARA @IKEAUSA @Nestle @redbull @BrandFinance &q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;Mapping the World&s;s Most Valuable Brands in 2018&q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;The most valuable companies in the world often have an immediately recognizable brand with a clear message.

Fortune took the largest companies in the world in every industry, and surveyed executives and analysts asking them to rate the strength of each one. We took the top 50 all-star companies and placed the logos of each one in a circle within the headquartered country. The size of the circle corresponds to the company&a;rsquo;s total market capitalization, with the largest circles representing companies valued at over $500B. We then color-coded each one by industry, and grouped the ones belonging to the same industries together. The result is a kaleidoscopic map of the most admired companies in the world that lets you quickly identify several trends about reputations in the corporate world.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;First off, companies headquartered in the United States dominate the list, partly because Fortune&a;rsquo;s methodology favored American companies, but also because the U.S. simply has the&l;a href=\&q;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=US&a;amp;view=map&a;amp;year_high_desc=true\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; largest economy&l;/a&g; in the world. Within the U.S., Apple totally dominates with a market cap of $905B, terrifyingly close to becoming the&l;a href=\&q;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-03-01/apple-is-going-to-be-the-first-trillion-dollar-company\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; first trillion-dollar company&l;/a&g; in history. Amazon ($737B) and Microsoft ($735B) also stand out in the computer industry. Interestingly, the fourth largest company on our list is Facebook, but its market cap is significantly less at only $443B. The companies start to get crowded below Facebook&a;rsquo;s valuation, as the map clearly demonstrates. In other words, the biggest companies are really, really big compared to everyone else.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;The map also illustrates how the most admired companies come from a variety of different industries. From Internet companies to hotel chains and petroleum manufacturers, it is fair to say that a company can build a solid reputation regardless of industry. Many sectors also have more than one company making the list too, suggesting that a positive reputation can rub off onto similar competitors.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;One more trend is worth pointing out. Almost all the companies on the list specialize in one industry. The exception is Berkshire Hathaway, which is listed as the only insurance company on our viz. That&a;rsquo;s because they own&l;a href=\&q;https://www.geico.com/about/corporate/corporate-ownership/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; GEICO&l;/a&g; as well as a few other insurance companies. In reality, Berkshire is a giant holding company with vested interests across a &l;a href=\&q;https://www.cnbc.com/berkshire-hathaway-portfolio/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;variety of different industries&l;/a&g;. Amazon, Apple and Google might be headed down a similar path, but they aren&a;rsquo;t quite there yet. Building a good reputation requires a killer business model with mass appeal in a single industry.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;Top 10 Most Admired Companies&a;nbsp;&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1. Apple: Computers/Software/IT, $905B&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;2. Amazon: Internet, $7367B&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;3.

Google is the second youngest with 20 years of experience organizing the world&a;rsquo;s knowledge. Every other company has a longstanding legacy of product innovation and customer service. It looks like Warren Buffett was probably right with how long it takes to build a good reputation.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Data: &l;a href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/sources/world-most-admired-companies-2018\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Table 1.1&l;/a&g;&a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/world-most-admired-companies-2018&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;Visualizing the World&s;s Most Admired Companies  https://howmuch.net/articles/world-most-admired-companies-2018 via @howmuch_net #dataviz #business #money @Apple @amazon @Microsoft @facebook @jpmorgan @Google @Visa @exxonmobil @CocaCola @intel &q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;Visualizing the World&s;s Most Admired Companies &q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;Every company wants to cultivate a desirable brand commanding respect and attention.

First, GOBankingRates figured out the largest bank headquartered in each state.&a;nbsp;It is important to pause and consider GOBankingRates&a;rsquo; methodology in putting the data together. They looked at official &l;a href=\&q;https://www.fdic.gov\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;FDIC&l;/a&g; documents to find the headquarter location and deposit totals from 2017, which can often be different from what one might expect. For example, Wells Fargo has its world headquarters in San Francisco, but the bank&a;rsquo;s U.S. operates are actually headquartered in Sioux Falls, SD. Same thing goes for Charles Schwab&a;mdash;the investment company is located in San Francisco, but the bank is kept separately in Nevada. And if you watched the&l;a href=\&q;https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/02/02/u-s-bank-stadium-ready-super-bowl-closeup/300621002/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Super Bowl&l;/a&g;, you know U.S. Bank is associated with Minneapolis.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;In terms of general trends, our map demonstrates how almost none of the states with a large bank (over $50B in deposits in a single market) are located in the Midwest. The two exceptions are U.S. Bank which controls the top spot in Ohio ($62.4B) and Wells Fargo in South Dakota&a;mdash;as if South Dakota even belongs in the Midwest. All the other banks headquartered across the country&a;rsquo;s midsection are relatively small in terms of deposit size.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;In fact, the smallest banks tend to be in states with comparably small populations. Wyoming takes last place with the only institution under a billion in deposits, Hilltop National Bank ($0.6B), followed by Idaho with D.L. Evans Bank ($1.1B). Even the First National Bank of Alaska is more than twice as big ($2.5B). If these banks want to grow deposits, they need to move to larger population centers.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Here are the ten largest banks in terms of deposits held within a single market ($ billion), together with their total holdings company wide ($ billion).&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1. Wells Fargo Bank: South Dakota $264.9 inside market and $1,200 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;2. Bank of America: North Carolina $171.9 inside market and $1,300 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;3. Charles Schwab Bank: Nevada $162.4 inside market and $162.4 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;4. Ally Bank: Utah $86.3 inside market and $86.3 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;5. MUFG Union Bank: California $80.6 inside market and $86.8 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;6. TD Bank: Delaware $79.7 inside market and $227.1 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;7. USAA Federal Savings Bank: Texas $72 inside market and $72 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;8. Capital One Bank: Virginia $66.2 inside market and $66.2 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;9.&a;nbsp;U.S. Bank: Ohio $62.4 inside market and $329.5 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;10.&a;nbsp;SunTrust Bank: $54.3 inside market and $162.7 in total&a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;All this goes to show that the world of bank deposits is complicated. Never assume the largest banks are always located in booming metropolises, as Wells Fargo and Northfield Savings Bank demonstrate. And yet the general trend remains undeniable&a;mdash;having a large population only helps to grow the size of a bank&a;rsquo;s deposits too.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;Data: &l;a href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/sources/largest-bank-in-every-state\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Table 1.1&a;nbsp;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/largest-bank-in-every-state&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;The Biggest Banks for Your Buck in Every State   https://howmuch.net/articles/largest-bank-in-every-state via @howmuch_net #Banking #money #business #USA #Dataviz &q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;The Biggest Banks for Your Buck in Every State &q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;The local bank is a cornerstone of small towns, but in an age of global finance some banks now have hundreds of billions in deposits.

They calculate the market value for the brand names of the most popular companies in the world, which includes the hard dollar value of a company&a;rsquo;s assets as well as its trademarks, patents, and what accountants call &a;ldquo;goodwill.&a;rdquo; Then, Brand Finance scores the overall the strength of a company&a;rsquo;s brand based on how it is perceived by customers, employees and other stakeholders. We created our map by adjusting the size of each country according to the market value of its most valuable brand, and we color-coded each country based on its strength.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;We did this same type of analysis&l;a href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/articles/most-valuable-brands-2017\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; last year&l;/a&g;. It&a;rsquo;s interesting to flip between 2017 and 2018 versions of the map because it quickly demonstrates how the economy has changed in the past year. Amazon surpassed Google to become the most valuable company in the United States at $150.8B, thanks in large part to the&l;a href=\&q;https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/06/why-amazon-bought-whole-foods/530652/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; acquisition&l;/a&g; of Whole Foods. And before Google, the most valuable American brand was Apple&a;mdash;meaning the top spot has changed 3 years in a row. Perhaps Amazon shouldn&a;rsquo;t get too comfortable, unless they get those&l;a href=\&q;https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Prime-Air/b?node=8037720011\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Prime Air drones&l;/a&g; to take off soon.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Europe also has several highly valuable and strong brands, including Mercedes-Benz ($43.9B) from Germany and Shell ($39.4) in the Netherlands. The strongest brand on our map is Lego at 90.6, although the brand itself is worth comparatively less ($7.6B). They clearly have the market for plastic building brick toys cornered.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;China has the second strongest brand in the world in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) at 90.3, a multinational banking company with a huge portfolio. ICBC puts China in elite territory with a very high market value ($59.2B). Another bank based in Russia, Sberbank, also cracks that 90-point threshold, coming in at 90.1 with a respectable market value of $11.6B.&l;a href=\&q;http://fortune.com/2015/07/22/china-global-500-government-owned/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; ICBC&l;/a&g; and&l;a href=\&q;https://www.reuters.com/article/russia-sberbank-dividends/russia-discussing-dividend-hike-at-state-owned-sberbank-sources-idUSL8N1NF9G7\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Sberbank&l;/a&g; are both controlled by their respective governments, which makes Lego&a;rsquo;s accomplishment all the more impressive.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;That brings up a larger point. Our map has a wide variety of different companies on it, but they generally fall into three categories: consumer brands, legacy manufacturers, and banks. There just isn&a;rsquo;t the same dominance in other industries like insurance, health care or even brick and mortar stores.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;Top 10 Countries with the Most Valuable Brands in the World&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1.

Sure, Amazon&a;rsquo;s market dominance contributes to its brand, but the strongest brand (Lego) doesn&a;rsquo;t even break the top ten in value. In fact, three countries in the top ten have brands with scores in the 70s, which suggests that the list will only keep changing next year.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Data: &l;a href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/sources/most-valuable-brands-2018\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Table 1.1&a;nbsp;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/most-valuable-brands-2018&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;Mapping the World&s;s Most Valuable Brands in 2018 https://howmuch.net/articles/most-valuable-brands-2018 via @howmuch_net #dataviz #business #brands #USA #Money @amazon @MercedesBenz @Samsung @Toyota @BP_plc @ZARA @IKEAUSA @Nestle @redbull @BrandFinance &q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;Mapping the World&s;s Most Valuable Brands in 2018&q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;The most valuable companies in the world often have an immediately recognizable brand with a clear message.

Zippia analyzed contributions from employees at the 250,000 biggest companies in the country and found well over 30 million donations records from 2007 through 2017. We took the 30 most politically active companies on the Fortune 500 and ranked them in order of their campaign contributions over the last ten years. The bars represent the total contributions ($B) given to candidates in each party. We added the total figures and the percentage breakdown for Democrats and Republicans for easy reference. Several fascinating trends immediately jump out from our visual.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;First off, there&a;rsquo;s a lot more blue than red on the graph, indicating that Democrats rake in most of the political cash from corporate America. Keep in mind that these contributions are coming from employees who work at these companies, not the corporations themselves. It&a;rsquo;s actually &l;a href=\&q;https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/candidate-taking-receipts/who-can-and-cannot-contribute/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;illegal&l;/a&g; for corporations to make contributions directly to candidates. Republicans received more than 50% of the donations from only nine of the 30 companies, most of which tend to be grouped toward the bottom. Additionally, almost all of the bars include a tiny sliver of green, representing contributions to independent candidates. These contributions are there but they definitely don&a;rsquo;t amount to much overall. Ultimately, it is fair to say that employees of these big companies have spent the bulk of their political cash on Democrats over the last decade.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Let&a;rsquo;s take a closer look at the top of the list. Financial institutions dominate the marketplace for political donations, making up six of the top ten companies. Goldman Sachs is in first place by a long shot, shoveling $11.5B to members of both parties. The bank&a;rsquo;s money is split almost evenly across the aisle&a;mdash;possibly showing an effort to hedge against whichever party controls the levers of power. Charles Schwab provides an interesting contrast with Goldman in that the discount broker spends almost 70% of its political donations on Democrats. Microsoft and Apple also crack the top ten, but both companies clearly favor Democrats a lot more than Republicans, pumping 80% and 88%, respectively, of their political money into candidates on the left.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Perhaps the most interesting fact about our visual is what it doesn&a;rsquo;t show. Where is Walmart, the top ranked company on the&l;a href=\&q;http://fortune.com/fortune500/list/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Fortune 500&l;/a&g;? Or Berkshire Hathaway, McKesson, United HealthGroup, or CVS? What about other behemoths like Google or Amazon? Maybe their business models aren&a;rsquo;t as reliant on politicians for their business models to work. On the other hand, if so many major companies are missing from the list, why do employees at these particular companies spend so much on political campaigns? A new piece of legislation or a change in the regulatory environment could drastically affect the bottom line for big banks. Utilities like&l;a href=\&q;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-12/comcast-s-pledge-to-behave-without-open-web-rules-draws-doubters\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Comcast&l;/a&g; and&l;a href=\&q;http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/24/technology/business/att-net-neutrality/index.html\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; AT&a;amp;T&l;/a&g; are heavily invested in the ongoing debate around net neutrality. Other companies rely directly on government contracts for business, like&l;a href=\&q;https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2017/11/10/6-companies-that-are-the-most-reliant-on-government-contracts/107395784/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Boeing&l;/a&g; and&l;a href=\&q;https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2017/11/10/6-companies-that-are-the-most-reliant-on-government-contracts/107395784/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Lockheed Martin&l;/a&g;. In short, what&a;rsquo;s a couple billion dollars spent on a political campaign if it means the government will stay out of your way?

Fortune took the largest companies in the world in every industry, and surveyed executives and analysts asking them to rate the strength of each one. We took the top 50 all-star companies and placed the logos of each one in a circle within the headquartered country. The size of the circle corresponds to the company&a;rsquo;s total market capitalization, with the largest circles representing companies valued at over $500B. We then color-coded each one by industry, and grouped the ones belonging to the same industries together. The result is a kaleidoscopic map of the most admired companies in the world that lets you quickly identify several trends about reputations in the corporate world.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;First off, companies headquartered in the United States dominate the list, partly because Fortune&a;rsquo;s methodology favored American companies, but also because the U.S. simply has the&l;a href=\&q;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=US&a;amp;view=map&a;amp;year_high_desc=true\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; largest economy&l;/a&g; in the world. Within the U.S., Apple totally dominates with a market cap of $905B, terrifyingly close to becoming the&l;a href=\&q;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-03-01/apple-is-going-to-be-the-first-trillion-dollar-company\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; first trillion-dollar company&l;/a&g; in history. Amazon ($737B) and Microsoft ($735B) also stand out in the computer industry. Interestingly, the fourth largest company on our list is Facebook, but its market cap is significantly less at only $443B. The companies start to get crowded below Facebook&a;rsquo;s valuation, as the map clearly demonstrates. In other words, the biggest companies are really, really big compared to everyone else.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;The map also illustrates how the most admired companies come from a variety of different industries. From Internet companies to hotel chains and petroleum manufacturers, it is fair to say that a company can build a solid reputation regardless of industry. Many sectors also have more than one company making the list too, suggesting that a positive reputation can rub off onto similar competitors.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;One more trend is worth pointing out. Almost all the companies on the list specialize in one industry. The exception is Berkshire Hathaway, which is listed as the only insurance company on our viz. That&a;rsquo;s because they own&l;a href=\&q;https://www.geico.com/about/corporate/corporate-ownership/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; GEICO&l;/a&g; as well as a few other insurance companies. In reality, Berkshire is a giant holding company with vested interests across a &l;a href=\&q;https://www.cnbc.com/berkshire-hathaway-portfolio/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;variety of different industries&l;/a&g;. Amazon, Apple and Google might be headed down a similar path, but they aren&a;rsquo;t quite there yet. Building a good reputation requires a killer business model with mass appeal in a single industry.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;Top 10 Most Admired Companies&a;nbsp;&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1.

First, GOBankingRates figured out the largest bank headquartered in each state.&a;nbsp;It is important to pause and consider GOBankingRates&a;rsquo; methodology in putting the data together. They looked at official &l;a href=\&q;https://www.fdic.gov\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;FDIC&l;/a&g; documents to find the headquarter location and deposit totals from 2017, which can often be different from what one might expect. For example, Wells Fargo has its world headquarters in San Francisco, but the bank&a;rsquo;s U.S. operates are actually headquartered in Sioux Falls, SD. Same thing goes for Charles Schwab&a;mdash;the investment company is located in San Francisco, but the bank is kept separately in Nevada. And if you watched the&l;a href=\&q;https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/02/02/u-s-bank-stadium-ready-super-bowl-closeup/300621002/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Super Bowl&l;/a&g;, you know U.S. Bank is associated with Minneapolis.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;In terms of general trends, our map demonstrates how almost none of the states with a large bank (over $50B in deposits in a single market) are located in the Midwest. The two exceptions are U.S. Bank which controls the top spot in Ohio ($62.4B) and Wells Fargo in South Dakota&a;mdash;as if South Dakota even belongs in the Midwest. All the other banks headquartered across the country&a;rsquo;s midsection are relatively small in terms of deposit size.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;In fact, the smallest banks tend to be in states with comparably small populations. Wyoming takes last place with the only institution under a billion in deposits, Hilltop National Bank ($0.6B), followed by Idaho with D.L. Evans Bank ($1.1B). Even the First National Bank of Alaska is more than twice as big ($2.5B). If these banks want to grow deposits, they need to move to larger population centers.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Here are the ten largest banks in terms of deposits held within a single market ($ billion), together with their total holdings company wide ($ billion).&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1. Wells Fargo Bank: South Dakota $264.9 inside market and $1,200 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;2. Bank of America: North Carolina $171.9 inside market and $1,300 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;3. Charles Schwab Bank: Nevada $162.4 inside market and $162.4 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;4. Ally Bank: Utah $86.3 inside market and $86.3 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;5. MUFG Union Bank: California $80.6 inside market and $86.8 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;6. TD Bank: Delaware $79.7 inside market and $227.1 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;7. USAA Federal Savings Bank: Texas $72 inside market and $72 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;8. Capital One Bank: Virginia $66.2 inside market and $66.2 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;9.&a;nbsp;U.S. Bank: Ohio $62.4 inside market and $329.5 in total&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;10.&a;nbsp;SunTrust Bank: $54.3 inside market and $162.7 in total&a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;All this goes to show that the world of bank deposits is complicated. Never assume the largest banks are always located in booming metropolises, as Wells Fargo and Northfield Savings Bank demonstrate. And yet the general trend remains undeniable&a;mdash;having a large population only helps to grow the size of a bank&a;rsquo;s deposits too.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;Data: &l;a href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/sources/largest-bank-in-every-state\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Table 1.1&a;nbsp;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/largest-bank-in-every-state&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;The Biggest Banks for Your Buck in Every State   https://howmuch.net/articles/largest-bank-in-every-state via @howmuch_net #Banking #money #business #USA #Dataviz &q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;The Biggest Banks for Your Buck in Every State &q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;The local bank is a cornerstone of small towns, but in an age of global finance some banks now have hundreds of billions in deposits.

They calculate the market value for the brand names of the most popular companies in the world, which includes the hard dollar value of a company&a;rsquo;s assets as well as its trademarks, patents, and what accountants call &a;ldquo;goodwill.&a;rdquo; Then, Brand Finance scores the overall the strength of a company&a;rsquo;s brand based on how it is perceived by customers, employees and other stakeholders. We created our map by adjusting the size of each country according to the market value of its most valuable brand, and we color-coded each country based on its strength.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;We did this same type of analysis&l;a href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/articles/most-valuable-brands-2017\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; last year&l;/a&g;. It&a;rsquo;s interesting to flip between 2017 and 2018 versions of the map because it quickly demonstrates how the economy has changed in the past year. Amazon surpassed Google to become the most valuable company in the United States at $150.8B, thanks in large part to the&l;a href=\&q;https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/06/why-amazon-bought-whole-foods/530652/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; acquisition&l;/a&g; of Whole Foods. And before Google, the most valuable American brand was Apple&a;mdash;meaning the top spot has changed 3 years in a row. Perhaps Amazon shouldn&a;rsquo;t get too comfortable, unless they get those&l;a href=\&q;https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Prime-Air/b?node=8037720011\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Prime Air drones&l;/a&g; to take off soon.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Europe also has several highly valuable and strong brands, including Mercedes-Benz ($43.9B) from Germany and Shell ($39.4) in the Netherlands. The strongest brand on our map is Lego at 90.6, although the brand itself is worth comparatively less ($7.6B). They clearly have the market for plastic building brick toys cornered.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;China has the second strongest brand in the world in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) at 90.3, a multinational banking company with a huge portfolio. ICBC puts China in elite territory with a very high market value ($59.2B). Another bank based in Russia, Sberbank, also cracks that 90-point threshold, coming in at 90.1 with a respectable market value of $11.6B.&l;a href=\&q;http://fortune.com/2015/07/22/china-global-500-government-owned/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; ICBC&l;/a&g; and&l;a href=\&q;https://www.reuters.com/article/russia-sberbank-dividends/russia-discussing-dividend-hike-at-state-owned-sberbank-sources-idUSL8N1NF9G7\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Sberbank&l;/a&g; are both controlled by their respective governments, which makes Lego&a;rsquo;s accomplishment all the more impressive.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;That brings up a larger point. Our map has a wide variety of different companies on it, but they generally fall into three categories: consumer brands, legacy manufacturers, and banks. There just isn&a;rsquo;t the same dominance in other industries like insurance, health care or even brick and mortar stores.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;Top 10 Countries with the Most Valuable Brands in the World&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1. United States: Amazon at $150.8B and 79.7&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;2. South Korea: Samsung at $92.3B and 89.5&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;3. China: ICBC at $59.2B and 90.3&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;4. Germany: Mercedes-Benz at $43.9B and 79.7&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;5. Japan: Toyota at $43.7B and 82.9&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;6. Netherlands: Shell at $39.4B and 80.6&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;7. Sweden: IKEA at $24.4B and 79.1&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;8. France: Orange at $22.2B and 82.7&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;9. United Kingdom: BP at $19.6B and 75.2&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;10. Switzerland: Nestl&a;eacute; at $19.4B and 83.4&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;The main take away from our analysis is that a brand&a;rsquo;s value and strength are not necessarily correlated. Sure, Amazon&a;rsquo;s market dominance contributes to its brand, but the strongest brand (Lego) doesn&a;rsquo;t even break the top ten in value. In fact, three countries in the top ten have brands with scores in the 70s, which suggests that the list will only keep changing next year.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Data: &l;a href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/sources/most-valuable-brands-2018\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Table 1.1&a;nbsp;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/most-valuable-brands-2018&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;Mapping the World&s;s Most Valuable Brands in 2018 https://howmuch.net/articles/most-valuable-brands-2018 via @howmuch_net #dataviz #business #brands #USA #Money @amazon @MercedesBenz @Samsung @Toyota @BP_plc @ZARA @IKEAUSA @Nestle @redbull @BrandFinance &q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;Mapping the World&s;s Most Valuable Brands in 2018&q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;The most valuable companies in the world often have an immediately recognizable brand with a clear message.

They can be wall mounted and located in reduced spaces.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;You will find that electric water heaters are less expensive to buy than gas types even before considering the cost of gas ventilation and gas pipe requirements, but in most regions electricity is the more costly heat source. Tankless heaters may cost more, but are considered lower cost to operate with their higher efficiency.&l;br&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The cost to install average electric water heating depends upon type, heating flow and tank capacity, preparation and special needs, and the labor rate.&l;br&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;In the following table the Labor Cost figure is what the able and prepared DIY persons should expect to save by performing the corresponding tasks.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;Electric water heater replacement:&l;/strong&g;&a;nbsp;

There are three tiers of gas prices: states that are dark green have gas chains that offer between $2.50 and $2.99 per gallon of gas, states that are just green prices between $2.00 and $2.49 per gallon and states that are light green offer prices between $1.50 and $1.99 per gallon. The data were collected from &l;a href=\&q;http://www.businessinsider.com/cheapest-gas-station-chain-in-every-state-2018-2/#alabama-circle-k-1\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Business Insider&l;/a&g;. To determine the list, BI analyzed information from &l;a href=\&q;http://www.gasbuddy.com\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;GasBuddy.com&l;/a&g;&a;rsquo;s lists of Top Ten Lowest Gas prices in every state; this information is based on daily input from its 60,000,000 plus users and is subject to change.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;States with gas chains that offer high prices per gallon tend to lie within the Northwest region of the United States, although there are some exceptions. New York, Pennsylvania, Maine and Vermont all lie within the highest tier of prices. One reason states in the Northwest have higher gas prices may be due to &l;a href=\&q;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gas-prices-up-to-2-year-high-after-hurricane-harvey/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Hurricane Harvey, according to GasBuddy and Oil Price Information Service&l;/a&g;.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;But there are states outside of the Northeast that don&a;rsquo;t get hit by hurricanes, but still have high gas prices. Both Alaska and Hawaii have the highest gas prices, but that is likely due to how remote those states are. The chain that offers the lowest prices in Hawaii is Freedom at $2.92 per gallon, which is the &l;a href=\&q;https://patch.com/hawaii/honolulu/hawaii-gas-prices-highest-us-generally-decrease-nationally\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;highest price for gas in the country&l;/a&g;. California is neither remote nor suffers from hurricanes, yet the chain with lowest gas prices in California is the third highest in the country at $2.73 per gallon. &a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;One trend to notice is the prevalence of the chain wholesale company Costco found throughout the country. Costco appears far more than any other company as the chain with the lowest gas price across the 50 states. But Costco doesn&a;rsquo;t offer the same prices in those states. For example, Costco is the chain that offers the lowest gas prices in Texas at $1.95 per gallon, which is the cheapest price in the country. At the same time, Costco is also the chain that offers the lowest price in Connecticut at $2.49 per gallon, which is much higher than Texas and nearly falls into the highest price tier.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Various gas chains are represented on the map, but not all offer the same prices. But don&a;rsquo;t be fooled by Costco&a;rsquo;s prevalence on the map. Costco still must raise and lower prices based on the relative competition for gas services in those states. If you want to save money on gas costs, you&a;rsquo;ll have to consider both the state and the gas chain.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Data: &l;a href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/sources/cheapest-gas-station-in-every-state\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Table 1.1&l;/a&g;&a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/cheapest-gas-station-in-every-state&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;This Map Shows the Cheapest Gas Station in Your State https://howmuch.net/articles/cheapest-gas-station-in-every-state via @howmuch_net #dataviz #map #Gas #gasprices #USA #money #personalfinance &q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;This Map Shows the Cheapest Gas Station in Your State&q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;Gas prices rise and fall, but either way it makes your wallet slimmer.

States colored dark purple have an average annual deductible of between $5,000 and $6,913, states colored light purple are between $4,000 and $4,999, states colored teal are between $3,000 and $3,999 and states colored dark teal are between $1,733 and $2,999. The data were collected from Stride Health. The figures were calculated based on the average of four popular silver plan deductibles from each state for single males, age 40 years old, non-smokers and annual income of $51,640 (the median income for males of that age).&a;nbsp;The data were collected from &l;a href=\&q;https://www.stridehealth.com\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Stride Health&l;/a&g;.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h4&g;The Five States with Highest Annual Deductibles&l;/h4&g;\n\n&l;ul&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Florida: $6,913&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Indiana: $6,763&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Ohio: $6,625&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Georgia: $6,188&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;New Hampshire: $6,163&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n&l;/ul&g;\n\n&l;h4&g;The Five States with the Lowest Annual Deductibles&l;/h4&g;\n\n&l;ul&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Pennsylvania: $1,733&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Oklahoma: $1,863&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;New Jersey: $2,075&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Massachusetts: $2,125&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;New York: $2,175&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n&l;/ul&g;\n\n&l;p&g;In the first map of the average health insurance rates, it is plain to see that most states fall into the bottom two categories. Wyoming and Alaska have the most expensive average health insurance rates in the country. Only 11 states fall into the second highest category of between $551 and $650 per month on average. Average annual deductibles are more spread out compared to health insurance rates. States in the Midwest region, with some notable exceptions in the rust belt, have low deductibles compared to the rest of the country.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;The rust belt is the region with the worst overall health insurance in terms of both costs and deductibles, but there are a few outliers. This is true of the south to a lesser extent. Deductibles are high in the south, but the premiums are generally lower. Indiana appears to have the worst combination of health insurance premiums and deductibles. The state has the 13th highest average monthly premium at $552 and the second highest a deductible in the country at $6,763. A &l;a href=\&q;https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2017/09/20/indiana-hospital-prices-outpatient-care-shockingly-high-rand-report-says/671262001/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;study by the Rand Corporation&l;/a&g; found that some hospitals in Indiana charge more than three times what they charge Medicare for the same procedures. Neighboring Illinois is a close second for the worst outcome with the ninth highest average monthly premium at $552 and the 11th highest average annual deductible at $5,325.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;There doesn&a;#39;t&a;nbsp;appear to be a connection between monthly premiums and annual deductible. Take for example New York and New Jersey. New York has the third highest average monthly premium at $624 per month on average, yet it has the fifth lowest deductible in the country at $2,175. New Jersey has a similar trend. The state has fifth highest monthly premium at $591 per month on average, but it also has the third lowest annual deductible at $2,075 on average. People in New York and New Jersey pay more per month but pay less towards their deductible over all.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;Now compare New York and New Jersey to Nevada and Kentucky. Nevada has the ninth lowest average monthly premium at $445 per month and also the ninth highest annual deductible in the country at $5,513 on average. Kentucky has the seventh lowest average monthly premium at $437 and the 13th highest deductible at $5,025. Although people in Kentucky and Nevada pay less per month on health insurance than people in New York and Kentucky, they have to pay far more towards their deductible if they need medical care. Currently Nevada is in the process or &l;a href=\&q;https://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/nevada-health-exchange-to-save-money-with-state-run-website/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;creating its own health insurance&l;/a&g; exchange to help people money.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Alaska is by far the most expensive at $780 per month on average. But despite the high monthly premiums, Alaska&a;rsquo;s average annual deductible is right around average at $3,750. The federal government alleges that &l;a href=\&q;http://www.healthleadersmedia.com/community-rural/feds-urge-repeal-alaska-law-healthcare-competition\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Alaska has anticompetitive healthcare laws&l;/a&g; that raises health insurance costs and hurts consumers. Hawaii has to lowest monthly premiums in the country at $411 per month on average and the seventh lowest average annual deductible at $2,750. When taking into account both monthly health insurance premiums and annual deductibles, Hawaii comes out on top compared to other states.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Both average monthly health insurance costs and average annual deductibles vary over the 50 states.

According to &l;a href=\&q;https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/filing-season-statistics-for-week-ending-december-29-2017\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;IRS data&l;/a&g;, the average tax refund was $2,895 per taxpayer. But that&a;rsquo;s just the average. The refunds received by taxpayers varied significantly between states and was within a range of between $2,302 and $3,133.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;There are only three states where the average tax refund was more than $3,000: Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. Taxpayers in Texas received the most on average at $3,133 per taxpayer. That compares to the national average of $2,895. Additionally, Texas is one of the &l;a href=\&q;https://www.thebalance.com/states-without-an-income-tax-3193345\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;seven states that do not tax earned income&l;/a&g;. If you&a;rsquo;re really looking to save on taxes, Texas is the place to be. The three states with the lowest average were Maine, Oregon and Vermont. Maine had the lowest average tax refund in the country at $2,302 per taxpayer. One thing to notice is that eight of the 10 states with the lowest tax refund share a border with Canada. Also, states with refunds lower than average tend to &l;a href=\&q;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;states with low populations&l;/a&g;, but there are a few exceptions.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Another thing to notice is that the states with the lowest tax refunds are further away from the national average than the states with the highest refunds. Texas is only $238 above the average ($3133 - $2895). The bottom five states &a;ndash; Maine, Oregon, Vermont, Wisconsin and Montana &a;ndash; are all more than $500 away from the average, more than double the distance from the average of Texas. This is because the four most populated states in the country &a;ndash; California, Florida, New York and Texas &a;ndash; all had relatively larger refunds compared to smaller states. This weighed the average national refund higher. &a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;If you&a;rsquo;re looking to save the most on your taxes, you still might want to move away from the border with Canada and towards a southern state. If you are considering moving to a new state to save on taxes, then Texas is that best choice. Either way, you&a;rsquo;ll only save a few hundred dollars.

Dark red states are the most expensive, costing over $4,000/year, and dark blue states are the cheapest with under $1,300/year. Our map makes the geographic and weather-related factors underlying the cost of home insurance.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Let&a;rsquo;s back up for a second and make sure we cover the basics. Home insurance covers both the structural value of a home and all the belongings inside it. Federally-backed mortgages require homeowners to buy insurance&a;mdash;if a fire comes along and burns down a house without insurance, the lender is left with no tangible asset. Many people also don&a;rsquo;t realize that homeowners insurance is&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-homeowners-insurance-wont-cover-if-a-hurricane-hits-1504897428\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; different&l;/a&g; from flood insurance and earthquake insurance. It&a;rsquo;s a complex marketplace with a lot of different pricing factors.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;With all that being said, severe weather directly affects home insurance costs. The least expensive state for home insurance is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean&a;mdash;it costs only $703 in Hawaii. Florida is at the opposite end of the spectrum, where it costs a whopping $6,892 to insure a home. Hurricanes are the obvious explanation for the discrepancy between both states. Hawaii almost never gets severe weather, and only a handful of hurricanes have hit the island in the last&l;a href=\&q;https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/08/06/338265427/hawaii-which-almost-never-has-hurricanes-is-getting-ready-for-2\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; 70 years&l;/a&g;. Florida, on the other hand, endures more&l;a href=\&q;https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/one-hundred-years-of-hurricanes/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; direct hits&l;/a&g; than any other state.

A homeowner in Florida would pay $6,189 more every year. Think about that cost for the typical 30-year loan: the average Floridian will drop over $185K more than someone in Hawaii just on insurance. According to &l;a href=\&q;https://www.zillow.com/fl/home-values/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Zillow&l;/a&g;, that&a;rsquo;s almost how much it costs to buy a home in the first place.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;It isn&a;rsquo;t surprising that states bordering the Gulf of Mexico have the highest home insurance costs in the nation. Louisiana is the second most expensive at $6,115, and Alabama is the third-priciest at $4,532. Both states suffered massive devastation in recent memory due to hurricanes. The band of dark red states around the Gulf stand in stark contrast with the dark blue states in the Northwest, where widespread severe weather almost never happens. Things are also comparatively cheap across the Upper Midwest and the Northeast.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;Top 10 Most Affordable States for Home Insurance&a;nbsp;&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1.

The chain that offers the lowest prices in Hawaii is Freedom at $2.92 per gallon, which is the &l;a href=\&q;https://patch.com/hawaii/honolulu/hawaii-gas-prices-highest-us-generally-decrease-nationally\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;highest price for gas in the country&l;/a&g;. California is neither remote nor suffers from hurricanes, yet the chain with lowest gas prices in California is the third highest in the country at $2.73 per gallon. &a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;One trend to notice is the prevalence of the chain wholesale company Costco found throughout the country. Costco appears far more than any other company as the chain with the lowest gas price across the 50 states. But Costco doesn&a;rsquo;t offer the same prices in those states. For example, Costco is the chain that offers the lowest gas prices in Texas at $1.95 per gallon, which is the cheapest price in the country. At the same time, Costco is also the chain that offers the lowest price in Connecticut at $2.49 per gallon, which is much higher than Texas and nearly falls into the highest price tier.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Various gas chains are represented on the map, but not all offer the same prices. But don&a;rsquo;t be fooled by Costco&a;rsquo;s prevalence on the map. Costco still must raise and lower prices based on the relative competition for gas services in those states. If you want to save money on gas costs, you&a;rsquo;ll have to consider both the state and the gas chain.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Data: &l;a href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/sources/cheapest-gas-station-in-every-state\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Table 1.1&l;/a&g;&a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/cheapest-gas-station-in-every-state&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;This Map Shows the Cheapest Gas Station in Your State https://howmuch.net/articles/cheapest-gas-station-in-every-state via @howmuch_net #dataviz #map #Gas #gasprices #USA #money #personalfinance &q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;This Map Shows the Cheapest Gas Station in Your State&q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;Gas prices rise and fall, but either way it makes your wallet slimmer.

States colored dark purple have an average annual deductible of between $5,000 and $6,913, states colored light purple are between $4,000 and $4,999, states colored teal are between $3,000 and $3,999 and states colored dark teal are between $1,733 and $2,999. The data were collected from Stride Health. The figures were calculated based on the average of four popular silver plan deductibles from each state for single males, age 40 years old, non-smokers and annual income of $51,640 (the median income for males of that age).&a;nbsp;The data were collected from &l;a href=\&q;https://www.stridehealth.com\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Stride Health&l;/a&g;.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h4&g;The Five States with Highest Annual Deductibles&l;/h4&g;\n\n&l;ul&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Florida: $6,913&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Indiana: $6,763&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Ohio: $6,625&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Georgia: $6,188&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;New Hampshire: $6,163&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n&l;/ul&g;\n\n&l;h4&g;The Five States with the Lowest Annual Deductibles&l;/h4&g;\n\n&l;ul&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Pennsylvania: $1,733&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Oklahoma: $1,863&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;New Jersey: $2,075&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Massachusetts: $2,125&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;New York: $2,175&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n&l;/ul&g;\n\n&l;p&g;In the first map of the average health insurance rates, it is plain to see that most states fall into the bottom two categories. Wyoming and Alaska have the most expensive average health insurance rates in the country. Only 11 states fall into the second highest category of between $551 and $650 per month on average. Average annual deductibles are more spread out compared to health insurance rates. States in the Midwest region, with some notable exceptions in the rust belt, have low deductibles compared to the rest of the country.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;The rust belt is the region with the worst overall health insurance in terms of both costs and deductibles, but there are a few outliers. This is true of the south to a lesser extent. Deductibles are high in the south, but the premiums are generally lower. Indiana appears to have the worst combination of health insurance premiums and deductibles. The state has the 13th highest average monthly premium at $552 and the second highest a deductible in the country at $6,763. A &l;a href=\&q;https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2017/09/20/indiana-hospital-prices-outpatient-care-shockingly-high-rand-report-says/671262001/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;study by the Rand Corporation&l;/a&g; found that some hospitals in Indiana charge more than three times what they charge Medicare for the same procedures. Neighboring Illinois is a close second for the worst outcome with the ninth highest average monthly premium at $552 and the 11th highest average annual deductible at $5,325.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;There doesn&a;#39;t&a;nbsp;appear to be a connection between monthly premiums and annual deductible. Take for example New York and New Jersey. New York has the third highest average monthly premium at $624 per month on average, yet it has the fifth lowest deductible in the country at $2,175. New Jersey has a similar trend. The state has fifth highest monthly premium at $591 per month on average, but it also has the third lowest annual deductible at $2,075 on average. People in New York and New Jersey pay more per month but pay less towards their deductible over all.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;Now compare New York and New Jersey to Nevada and Kentucky. Nevada has the ninth lowest average monthly premium at $445 per month and also the ninth highest annual deductible in the country at $5,513 on average. Kentucky has the seventh lowest average monthly premium at $437 and the 13th highest deductible at $5,025. Although people in Kentucky and Nevada pay less per month on health insurance than people in New York and Kentucky, they have to pay far more towards their deductible if they need medical care. Currently Nevada is in the process or &l;a href=\&q;https://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/nevada-health-exchange-to-save-money-with-state-run-website/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;creating its own health insurance&l;/a&g; exchange to help people money.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Alaska is by far the most expensive at $780 per month on average. But despite the high monthly premiums, Alaska&a;rsquo;s average annual deductible is right around average at $3,750. The federal government alleges that &l;a href=\&q;http://www.healthleadersmedia.com/community-rural/feds-urge-repeal-alaska-law-healthcare-competition\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Alaska has anticompetitive healthcare laws&l;/a&g; that raises health insurance costs and hurts consumers. Hawaii has to lowest monthly premiums in the country at $411 per month on average and the seventh lowest average annual deductible at $2,750. When taking into account both monthly health insurance premiums and annual deductibles, Hawaii comes out on top compared to other states.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Both average monthly health insurance costs and average annual deductibles vary over the 50 states. But it&a;rsquo;s not easy to tell what your deductible will based on your monthly health insurance costs, as the data shows. It&a;rsquo;s best to take both factors into consideration. Based on these two factors, Hawaii has the best overall health care outcome. But if you spend all your day at the beach, your stress levels are so low you might not even need health care!&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Data: &l;a href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/sources/health-insurance-rates-by-state\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Table 1.1&l;/a&g;&a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/health-insurance-rates-by-state&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;Here are the Most &a; Least Expensive States for Health Insurance  https://howmuch.net/articles/health-insurance-rates-by-state via @howmuch_net #PersonalFinance #Healthcare #insurance #DataViz #USA #money &q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;Here are the Most &a; Least Expensive States for Health Insurance&q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;Looking to save on health insurance?

According to &l;a href=\&q;https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/filing-season-statistics-for-week-ending-december-29-2017\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;IRS data&l;/a&g;, the average tax refund was $2,895 per taxpayer. But that&a;rsquo;s just the average. The refunds received by taxpayers varied significantly between states and was within a range of between $2,302 and $3,133.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;There are only three states where the average tax refund was more than $3,000: Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. Taxpayers in Texas received the most on average at $3,133 per taxpayer. That compares to the national average of $2,895. Additionally, Texas is one of the &l;a href=\&q;https://www.thebalance.com/states-without-an-income-tax-3193345\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;seven states that do not tax earned income&l;/a&g;. If you&a;rsquo;re really looking to save on taxes, Texas is the place to be. The three states with the lowest average were Maine, Oregon and Vermont. Maine had the lowest average tax refund in the country at $2,302 per taxpayer. One thing to notice is that eight of the 10 states with the lowest tax refund share a border with Canada. Also, states with refunds lower than average tend to &l;a href=\&q;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;states with low populations&l;/a&g;, but there are a few exceptions.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Another thing to notice is that the states with the lowest tax refunds are further away from the national average than the states with the highest refunds. Texas is only $238 above the average ($3133 - $2895). The bottom five states &a;ndash; Maine, Oregon, Vermont, Wisconsin and Montana &a;ndash; are all more than $500 away from the average, more than double the distance from the average of Texas. This is because the four most populated states in the country &a;ndash; California, Florida, New York and Texas &a;ndash; all had relatively larger refunds compared to smaller states.

Dark red states are the most expensive, costing over $4,000/year, and dark blue states are the cheapest with under $1,300/year. Our map makes the geographic and weather-related factors underlying the cost of home insurance.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Let&a;rsquo;s back up for a second and make sure we cover the basics. Home insurance covers both the structural value of a home and all the belongings inside it. Federally-backed mortgages require homeowners to buy insurance&a;mdash;if a fire comes along and burns down a house without insurance, the lender is left with no tangible asset. Many people also don&a;rsquo;t realize that homeowners insurance is&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-homeowners-insurance-wont-cover-if-a-hurricane-hits-1504897428\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; different&l;/a&g; from flood insurance and earthquake insurance. It&a;rsquo;s a complex marketplace with a lot of different pricing factors.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;With all that being said, severe weather directly affects home insurance costs. The least expensive state for home insurance is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean&a;mdash;it costs only $703 in Hawaii. Florida is at the opposite end of the spectrum, where it costs a whopping $6,892 to insure a home. Hurricanes are the obvious explanation for the discrepancy between both states. Hawaii almost never gets severe weather, and only a handful of hurricanes have hit the island in the last&l;a href=\&q;https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/08/06/338265427/hawaii-which-almost-never-has-hurricanes-is-getting-ready-for-2\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; 70 years&l;/a&g;. Florida, on the other hand, endures more&l;a href=\&q;https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/one-hundred-years-of-hurricanes/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; direct hits&l;/a&g; than any other state. The University of Miami&a;rsquo;s mascot is&a;mdash;guess what&a;mdash;&l;a href=\&q;http://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2390/miami-hurricanes\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;the Hurricanes&l;/a&g;.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;Let&a;rsquo;s take the difference between Hawaii and Florida to the logical conclusion. A homeowner in Florida would pay $6,189 more every year. Think about that cost for the typical 30-year loan: the average Floridian will drop over $185K more than someone in Hawaii just on insurance. According to &l;a href=\&q;https://www.zillow.com/fl/home-values/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Zillow&l;/a&g;, that&a;rsquo;s almost how much it costs to buy a home in the first place.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;It isn&a;rsquo;t surprising that states bordering the Gulf of Mexico have the highest home insurance costs in the nation. Louisiana is the second most expensive at $6,115, and Alabama is the third-priciest at $4,532. Both states suffered massive devastation in recent memory due to hurricanes. The band of dark red states around the Gulf stand in stark contrast with the dark blue states in the Northwest, where widespread severe weather almost never happens. Things are also comparatively cheap across the Upper Midwest and the Northeast.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;Top 10 Most Affordable States for Home Insurance&a;nbsp;&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1.

In short, they conduct a&l;a href=\&q;http://time.com/money/4939980/choosing-best-places-to-live-2017/\&q;&g; robust analysis&l;/a&g;. We wanted to simplify things, so we focused only on median household income (which corresponds to the size of the dot on the map) and future job prospects (which relates to the color of the dot). Mapping the data in this manner creates an easy snapshot of the most desirable places to live in the country.&a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp;&a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Let&a;rsquo;s look at the data one step at a time. There are eight cities where the median household income cracks $100K (see the list below). Paradise Valley, AZ tops the list with an incredible median income of $138,192. Second place is a full $10,000 lower in Mercer Island, WA, where the typical family brings home $128,484. Lower Merion, PA takes third place with a respectable median income of $117,438, a full $11,000 lower than Mercer Island. There&a;rsquo;s not as much separation from one place to another further down the list.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Median household income is a good metric for understanding how well-off communities are right now, but projected job growth serves as a leading indicator for how the economy will change in the future. Taking a look at only job growth reveals a very different list, with St. Augustine, FL leading the pack at an incredible 18.2% projected growth. We hasten to add the median income is only $47,748, but that will only increase if labor remains in high demand. Allen, TX comes in second place with projected growth topping 17% and median income at $104,524. That&a;rsquo;s more than twice as much as St. Augustine. These numbers indicate the labor market is going crazy in certain parts of the country.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Ideally, the best place to live would have both a high median income and strong projected job growth. In other words, looking at our map, the best place would be a large green dot&a;mdash;Allen, TX. As a matter of fact, there&a;rsquo;s a clear cluster of green dots stretching from Allen to Fishers, IN, indicating a buoyant economy in certain parts of the mid-South. The Northeast meanwhile continues to boast some of the highest median incomes but comparatively little in the way of robust job growth.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;If we have to pick one and only one metric for a ranking, median income is a good choice. Here&a;rsquo;s a simplified list of the top ten places to live, ranked in order of the median household income.

To determine the list, BI analyzed information from &l;a href=\&q;http://www.gasbuddy.com\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;GasBuddy.com&l;/a&g;&a;rsquo;s lists of Top Ten Lowest Gas prices in every state; this information is based on daily input from its 60,000,000 plus users and is subject to change.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;States with gas chains that offer high prices per gallon tend to lie within the Northwest region of the United States, although there are some exceptions. New York, Pennsylvania, Maine and Vermont all lie within the highest tier of prices. One reason states in the Northwest have higher gas prices may be due to &l;a href=\&q;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gas-prices-up-to-2-year-high-after-hurricane-harvey/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Hurricane Harvey, according to GasBuddy and Oil Price Information Service&l;/a&g;.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;But there are states outside of the Northeast that don&a;rsquo;t get hit by hurricanes, but still have high gas prices. Both Alaska and Hawaii have the highest gas prices, but that is likely due to how remote those states are. The chain that offers the lowest prices in Hawaii is Freedom at $2.92 per gallon, which is the &l;a href=\&q;https://patch.com/hawaii/honolulu/hawaii-gas-prices-highest-us-generally-decrease-nationally\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;highest price for gas in the country&l;/a&g;. California is neither remote nor suffers from hurricanes, yet the chain with lowest gas prices in California is the third highest in the country at $2.73 per gallon. &a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;One trend to notice is the prevalence of the chain wholesale company Costco found throughout the country. Costco appears far more than any other company as the chain with the lowest gas price across the 50 states. But Costco doesn&a;rsquo;t offer the same prices in those states. For example, Costco is the chain that offers the lowest gas prices in Texas at $1.95 per gallon, which is the cheapest price in the country. At the same time, Costco is also the chain that offers the lowest price in Connecticut at $2.49 per gallon, which is much higher than Texas and nearly falls into the highest price tier.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Various gas chains are represented on the map, but not all offer the same prices. But don&a;rsquo;t be fooled by Costco&a;rsquo;s prevalence on the map. Costco still must raise and lower prices based on the relative competition for gas services in those states. If you want to save money on gas costs, you&a;rsquo;ll have to consider both the state and the gas chain.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Data: &l;a href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/sources/cheapest-gas-station-in-every-state\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Table 1.1&l;/a&g;&a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/cheapest-gas-station-in-every-state&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;This Map Shows the Cheapest Gas Station in Your State https://howmuch.net/articles/cheapest-gas-station-in-every-state via @howmuch_net #dataviz #map #Gas #gasprices #USA #money #personalfinance &q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;This Map Shows the Cheapest Gas Station in Your State&q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;Gas prices rise and fall, but either way it makes your wallet slimmer.

States colored dark purple have an average annual deductible of between $5,000 and $6,913, states colored light purple are between $4,000 and $4,999, states colored teal are between $3,000 and $3,999 and states colored dark teal are between $1,733 and $2,999. The data were collected from Stride Health. The figures were calculated based on the average of four popular silver plan deductibles from each state for single males, age 40 years old, non-smokers and annual income of $51,640 (the median income for males of that age).&a;nbsp;The data were collected from &l;a href=\&q;https://www.stridehealth.com\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Stride Health&l;/a&g;.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h4&g;The Five States with Highest Annual Deductibles&l;/h4&g;\n\n&l;ul&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Florida: $6,913&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Indiana: $6,763&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Ohio: $6,625&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Georgia: $6,188&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;New Hampshire: $6,163&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n&l;/ul&g;\n\n&l;h4&g;The Five States with the Lowest Annual Deductibles&l;/h4&g;\n\n&l;ul&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Pennsylvania: $1,733&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Oklahoma: $1,863&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;New Jersey: $2,075&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Massachusetts: $2,125&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n\t&l;li&g;\n\t&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;New York: $2,175&l;/p&g;\n\t&l;/li&g;\n&l;/ul&g;\n\n&l;p&g;In the first map of the average health insurance rates, it is plain to see that most states fall into the bottom two categories. Wyoming and Alaska have the most expensive average health insurance rates in the country. Only 11 states fall into the second highest category of between $551 and $650 per month on average. Average annual deductibles are more spread out compared to health insurance rates. States in the Midwest region, with some notable exceptions in the rust belt, have low deductibles compared to the rest of the country.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;The rust belt is the region with the worst overall health insurance in terms of both costs and deductibles, but there are a few outliers. This is true of the south to a lesser extent. Deductibles are high in the south, but the premiums are generally lower. Indiana appears to have the worst combination of health insurance premiums and deductibles. The state has the 13th highest average monthly premium at $552 and the second highest a deductible in the country at $6,763. A &l;a href=\&q;https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2017/09/20/indiana-hospital-prices-outpatient-care-shockingly-high-rand-report-says/671262001/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;study by the Rand Corporation&l;/a&g; found that some hospitals in Indiana charge more than three times what they charge Medicare for the same procedures. Neighboring Illinois is a close second for the worst outcome with the ninth highest average monthly premium at $552 and the 11th highest average annual deductible at $5,325.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;There doesn&a;#39;t&a;nbsp;appear to be a connection between monthly premiums and annual deductible. Take for example New York and New Jersey. New York has the third highest average monthly premium at $624 per month on average, yet it has the fifth lowest deductible in the country at $2,175. New Jersey has a similar trend. The state has fifth highest monthly premium at $591 per month on average, but it also has the third lowest annual deductible at $2,075 on average. People in New York and New Jersey pay more per month but pay less towards their deductible over all.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;Now compare New York and New Jersey to Nevada and Kentucky. Nevada has the ninth lowest average monthly premium at $445 per month and also the ninth highest annual deductible in the country at $5,513 on average. Kentucky has the seventh lowest average monthly premium at $437 and the 13th highest deductible at $5,025. Although people in Kentucky and Nevada pay less per month on health insurance than people in New York and Kentucky, they have to pay far more towards their deductible if they need medical care. Currently Nevada is in the process or &l;a href=\&q;https://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/nevada-health-exchange-to-save-money-with-state-run-website/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;creating its own health insurance&l;/a&g; exchange to help people money.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Alaska is by far the most expensive at $780 per month on average. But despite the high monthly premiums, Alaska&a;rsquo;s average annual deductible is right around average at $3,750. The federal government alleges that &l;a href=\&q;http://www.healthleadersmedia.com/community-rural/feds-urge-repeal-alaska-law-healthcare-competition\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Alaska has anticompetitive healthcare laws&l;/a&g; that raises health insurance costs and hurts consumers. Hawaii has to lowest monthly premiums in the country at $411 per month on average and the seventh lowest average annual deductible at $2,750. When taking into account both monthly health insurance premiums and annual deductibles, Hawaii comes out on top compared to other states.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Both average monthly health insurance costs and average annual deductibles vary over the 50 states. But it&a;rsquo;s not easy to tell what your deductible will based on your monthly health insurance costs, as the data shows. It&a;rsquo;s best to take both factors into consideration. Based on these two factors, Hawaii has the best overall health care outcome. But if you spend all your day at the beach, your stress levels are so low you might not even need health care!&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Data: &l;a href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/sources/health-insurance-rates-by-state\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Table 1.1&l;/a&g;&a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/health-insurance-rates-by-state&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;Here are the Most &a; Least Expensive States for Health Insurance  https://howmuch.net/articles/health-insurance-rates-by-state via @howmuch_net #PersonalFinance #Healthcare #insurance #DataViz #USA #money &q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;Here are the Most &a; Least Expensive States for Health Insurance&q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;Looking to save on health insurance?

Taxpayers in Texas received the most on average at $3,133 per taxpayer. That compares to the national average of $2,895. Additionally, Texas is one of the &l;a href=\&q;https://www.thebalance.com/states-without-an-income-tax-3193345\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;seven states that do not tax earned income&l;/a&g;. If you&a;rsquo;re really looking to save on taxes, Texas is the place to be. The three states with the lowest average were Maine, Oregon and Vermont. Maine had the lowest average tax refund in the country at $2,302 per taxpayer. One thing to notice is that eight of the 10 states with the lowest tax refund share a border with Canada. Also, states with refunds lower than average tend to &l;a href=\&q;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;states with low populations&l;/a&g;, but there are a few exceptions.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Another thing to notice is that the states with the lowest tax refunds are further away from the national average than the states with the highest refunds. Texas is only $238 above the average ($3133 - $2895). The bottom five states &a;ndash; Maine, Oregon, Vermont, Wisconsin and Montana &a;ndash; are all more than $500 away from the average, more than double the distance from the average of Texas. This is because the four most populated states in the country &a;ndash; California, Florida, New York and Texas &a;ndash; all had relatively larger refunds compared to smaller states. This weighed the average national refund higher. &a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;If you&a;rsquo;re looking to save the most on your taxes, you still might want to move away from the border with Canada and towards a southern state. If you are considering moving to a new state to save on taxes, then Texas is that best choice. Either way, you&a;rsquo;ll only save a few hundred dollars. But if you&a;rsquo;re a penny pincher, every dollar counts!&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Data: &l;a href=\&q;https://howmuch.net/sources/average-tax-refund-in-every-state\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Table 1.1&l;/a&g;&a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/average-tax-refund-in-every-state&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;This Graph Shows the Average Tax Refund in Every State  https://howmuch.net/articles/average-tax-refund-in-every-state via @howmuch_net #tax #Taxrefund #PersonalFinance #money #dataviz #graph #USA&q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;This Graph Shows the Average Tax Refund in Every State&q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;Everyone dreads tax season, but at least there’s one thing to look forward to – your tax refund!

Dark red states are the most expensive, costing over $4,000/year, and dark blue states are the cheapest with under $1,300/year. Our map makes the geographic and weather-related factors underlying the cost of home insurance.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Let&a;rsquo;s back up for a second and make sure we cover the basics. Home insurance covers both the structural value of a home and all the belongings inside it. Federally-backed mortgages require homeowners to buy insurance&a;mdash;if a fire comes along and burns down a house without insurance, the lender is left with no tangible asset. Many people also don&a;rsquo;t realize that homeowners insurance is&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-homeowners-insurance-wont-cover-if-a-hurricane-hits-1504897428\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; different&l;/a&g; from flood insurance and earthquake insurance. It&a;rsquo;s a complex marketplace with a lot of different pricing factors.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;With all that being said, severe weather directly affects home insurance costs. The least expensive state for home insurance is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean&a;mdash;it costs only $703 in Hawaii. Florida is at the opposite end of the spectrum, where it costs a whopping $6,892 to insure a home. Hurricanes are the obvious explanation for the discrepancy between both states. Hawaii almost never gets severe weather, and only a handful of hurricanes have hit the island in the last&l;a href=\&q;https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/08/06/338265427/hawaii-which-almost-never-has-hurricanes-is-getting-ready-for-2\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; 70 years&l;/a&g;. Florida, on the other hand, endures more&l;a href=\&q;https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/one-hundred-years-of-hurricanes/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; direct hits&l;/a&g; than any other state. The University of Miami&a;rsquo;s mascot is&a;mdash;guess what&a;mdash;&l;a href=\&q;http://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2390/miami-hurricanes\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;the Hurricanes&l;/a&g;.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p&g;Let&a;rsquo;s take the difference between Hawaii and Florida to the logical conclusion. A homeowner in Florida would pay $6,189 more every year. Think about that cost for the typical 30-year loan: the average Floridian will drop over $185K more than someone in Hawaii just on insurance. According to &l;a href=\&q;https://www.zillow.com/fl/home-values/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Zillow&l;/a&g;, that&a;rsquo;s almost how much it costs to buy a home in the first place.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;It isn&a;rsquo;t surprising that states bordering the Gulf of Mexico have the highest home insurance costs in the nation. Louisiana is the second most expensive at $6,115, and Alabama is the third-priciest at $4,532. Both states suffered massive devastation in recent memory due to hurricanes. The band of dark red states around the Gulf stand in stark contrast with the dark blue states in the Northwest, where widespread severe weather almost never happens. Things are also comparatively cheap across the Upper Midwest and the Northeast.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;Top 10 Most Affordable States for Home Insurance&a;nbsp;&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1.

Homeowners can pay significantly more for insurance, all depending on where they live.

In short, they conduct a&l;a href=\&q;http://time.com/money/4939980/choosing-best-places-to-live-2017/\&q;&g; robust analysis&l;/a&g;. We wanted to simplify things, so we focused only on median household income (which corresponds to the size of the dot on the map) and future job prospects (which relates to the color of the dot). Mapping the data in this manner creates an easy snapshot of the most desirable places to live in the country.&a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp; &a;nbsp;&a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Let&a;rsquo;s look at the data one step at a time. There are eight cities where the median household income cracks $100K (see the list below). Paradise Valley, AZ tops the list with an incredible median income of $138,192. Second place is a full $10,000 lower in Mercer Island, WA, where the typical family brings home $128,484. Lower Merion, PA takes third place with a respectable median income of $117,438, a full $11,000 lower than Mercer Island. There&a;rsquo;s not as much separation from one place to another further down the list.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Median household income is a good metric for understanding how well-off communities are right now, but projected job growth serves as a leading indicator for how the economy will change in the future. Taking a look at only job growth reveals a very different list, with St. Augustine, FL leading the pack at an incredible 18.2% projected growth. We hasten to add the median income is only $47,748, but that will only increase if labor remains in high demand. Allen, TX comes in second place with projected growth topping 17% and median income at $104,524. That&a;rsquo;s more than twice as much as St. Augustine. These numbers indicate the labor market is going crazy in certain parts of the country.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Ideally, the best place to live would have both a high median income and strong projected job growth. In other words, looking at our map, the best place would be a large green dot&a;mdash;Allen, TX. As a matter of fact, there&a;rsquo;s a clear cluster of green dots stretching from Allen to Fishers, IN, indicating a buoyant economy in certain parts of the mid-South. The Northeast meanwhile continues to boast some of the highest median incomes but comparatively little in the way of robust job growth.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;If we have to pick one and only one metric for a ranking, median income is a good choice. Here&a;rsquo;s a simplified list of the top ten places to live, ranked in order of the median household income.

To generate our viz we first adjusted median income totals to account for inflation, also called real income, so that we could make true comparisons between different years. We then plotted figures for every year since 1997 on the same graph, revealing a quick snapshot of 20 years&a;rsquo; of economic history.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;GDP is an old school measure of the economy that originated during the industrial era. Many people think it&l;a href=\&q;https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21697845-gross-domestic-product-gdp-increasingly-poor-measure-prosperity-it-not-even\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; doesn&a;rsquo;t matter anymore&l;/a&g; because it fails to capture the changes in the quality of products in use at any given time. For example, GDP counts the physical costs of telegrams against the physical costs of email without considering the less tangible benefits of using the latter. GDP also ignores entire industries geared toward creating high-quality experiences (as opposed to physical products). That being said, it is still a shorthand way of measuring the health and trajectory of an economy, and it says a lot about both unemployment and wage growth. Developed countries like the United States typically have slower GDP growth than developing ones, like India or China.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Looking at the real median income figures tells an interesting story. The numbers have actually declined in 11 of the past 20 years, meaning that workers in general have smaller paychecks. As our graph demonstrates, wages are inversely correlated with employment. In other words, as employers shrink the number of individuals they employ the supply-and-demand effect allows them to pay their people less. Alternatively, &a;nbsp;when employment ticks up and labor becomes scarce, wages shoot back up. If the past is any indication,&l;a href=\&q;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-adds-200000-jobs-worker-pay-rises-at-fastest-pace-since-2009-2018-02-02\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; recent headlines&l;/a&g; suggest that American workers are due for another pay raise. In fact, in our graph 2016 was the best year for median incomes, rising 3.2% over the previous year to $59,039.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Things have generally been going well for American workers with GDP growth of 2-3% every year. Doubling that output to 5%, or even 6% as President Trump would like to see, would mean colossal and sustained gains in real wages for workers.

We combined both datasets to color-code each circle on the map, representing how expensive a gallon of gas costs on average in each state. Dark blue circles indicate expensive prices over $3.00/gallon, and light blue indicates cheap fill ups under $2.50/gallon. Then, we added a second circle to represent both the state and federal taxes levied on gas. This approach transforms the complicated reality of energy taxes into an easily understandable map.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Several interesting trends are readily apparent. First off, the federal gas tax comes out to 18.4 cents on the gallon sold in every state. The amount was&l;a href=\&q;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/white-house-says-its-willing-to-increase-the-federal-gas-tax-for-infrastructure/2017/10/26/1b459346-ba6d-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html?utm_term=.874d39d8a93c\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; last adjusted&l;/a&g; 25 years ago in 1993, back when a gallon cost&l;a href=\&q;https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&a;amp;s=emm_epm0_pte_nus_dpg&a;amp;f=w\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; about $1.06&l;/a&g;. And since the federal gas tax is not pegged to inflation, gas could cost $10.00 a gallon and the feds would still only collect 18.4 cents. This situation might change as Congress and President Trump negotiate an&l;a href=\&q;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/white-house-says-its-willing-to-increase-the-federal-gas-tax-for-infrastructure/2017/10/26/1b459346-ba6d-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html?utm_term=.874d39d8a93c\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; infrastructure spending deal&l;/a&g;, but who knows? For now, total taxes only change on our map from one state to another based on that particular state&a;rsquo;s laws.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;There are two clear regions with high gasoline prices in the Northeast and across the Midwest. Hawaii ($3.34) and Alaska ($3.08) are outliers in the dataset because of their extreme distance from the continental U.S. Hawaii has a relatively high total tax burden of $0.64 built into its price, but Alaskans pay the lowest rate in the country of $0.31/gallon, of which only 12 cents goes to the state government. That&a;rsquo;s extraordinarily low because Alaska is one of the&l;a href=\&q;https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/production/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; top oil-producing states&l;/a&g;, and the government already collects so much money directly from oil companies that&l;a href=\&q;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alaska-residents-receive-smaller-oil-fund-payments/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; it actually pays its citizens&l;/a&g; every year. Anyway, there&a;rsquo;s also a group of light blue states across the South, where the tax burden is low and the price at the pump is relatively cheap. The least expensive state in the country is Texas, where it costs only $2.28. That&a;rsquo;s right, gas is cheaper than a&l;a href=\&q;https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/dybretail.pdf\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; gallon of milk ($2.33)&l;/a&g; in six states&a;mdash;Arkansas, South Carolina, Mississippi, Missouri, Alabama and Texas.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;All of this indicates how state and federal gas taxes are the primary reason why it costs more at the pump in some places than others. Take California for example. The state is obviously in a league of its own regarding taxation. The average cost for a gallon is $3.18, of which 22.6% goes to the state and federal governments. That tax represents $0.72 of the price for every gallon. In neighboring Arizona, the tax burden is only $0.37 on the gallon, and the average overall price is consequently much cheaper at $2.35 per gallon. It&a;rsquo;s simple&a;mdash;the more something is taxed, the more it costs.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;Top 10 States Where it is Most Expensive to buy a Gallon of Gas&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1. Hawaii: $3.34 and $0.64 for taxes&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;2. California: $3.18 and $0.72 for taxes&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;3. Alaska: $3.08 and $0.31 for taxes&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;4. Washington: $2.94 and $0.68 for taxes&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;5.

New York: $2.69 and $0.63 for taxes&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;8. Connecticut: $2.68 and $0.58 for taxes&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;9. Nevada: $2.68 and $0.52 for taxes&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;10. Michigan: $2.64 and $0.61 for taxes&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;If President Trump proposes an increase in the federal gas tax, people living in these states are likely to feel it the most. They are already paying more than anyone else to fill up, and an increase in the federal tax will only make the situation worse. A better solution might be to peg the federal gas tax to inflation so that it rises and falls in tandem with the broader economy. This option would remove the issue as a hot-button political debate and ease the pain people feel when they hit the road.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Data: &l;a href=\&q;http://howmuch.net/sources/gas-prices-and-taxes\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Table 1.1&l;/a&g;&a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/gas-prices-and-taxes&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;This Map Shows How Gas Taxes Determine the Price at the Pump  https://howmuch.net/articles/gas-prices-and-taxes via @howmuch_net #Gas #Petrol #taxes #Fuel #petrolprice #USA #dataviz #money &q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;This Map Shows How Gas Taxes Determine the Price at the Pump&q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;President Trump is about to unveil a new infrastructure plan, which is rumored to include a hike in the federal gasoline tax.

The numbers reflect cash flows in 2016 leaving the U.S. to people in other countries through official channels, like a bank or wire transfer service. The data exclude cash flows through informal networks&a;mdash;think of sending cash through the mail&a;mdash;which economists suspect might add up to 50% to these totals. We placed the official statistics on a bubble chart, where the size of the circle corresponds to the total annual remittance for each country. We then color-coded each continent and included a percentage for easy reference. Our creative approach lends itself to several quick insights into global remittances leaving the U.S.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;First off, the Americas and Asia receive the majority of remittance payments, accounting for 42% and 39.8% of the total global cash flow, respectively. Europe, Africa and Australia and Oceana receive very little money in comparison. Mexico ($28.1B), China ($15.4B), India ($10.7B) and the Philippines ($10.5B) immediately stand out as the top four countries, making up a combined $64.7B in annual remittances, or almost half the entire market (47%, combined).&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;There are a lot of other interesting trends within each continent too. Generally speaking, remittances are not evenly spread out between countries&a;mdash;a select few dominate the market. Mexico is the obvious stand out in the Americas, but that&a;rsquo;s probably because of its physical proximity to the U.S. Instead, take a look at the Dominican Republic ($4.1B). Combined with Haiti ($1.4B), this one island would crack the top ten destinations for cash leaving the U.S. But just how big is the market for remittances to Mexico (at $28.1B? It&a;rsquo;s at an&l;a href=\&q;http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/02/news/economy/mexico-remittances/index.html\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; all-time high right now&l;/a&g;, and represents the equivalent of the entire&l;a href=\&q;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=PY&a;amp;view=map&a;amp;year_high_desc=true\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; economy of Paraguay&l;/a&g;. In other words, there&a;rsquo;s an enormous transfer of wealth happening year after year.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;There&a;rsquo;s a similar pattern on other continents too, where a select few countries receive a disproportionate share of remittances. Look at Africa, where Nigeria pulls in $5.7B every year. Or consider Europe, where Germany ($2.8B), France ($2.3B) and Italy ($1.4B) are the only three countries breaking the $1 billion mark. Things look similar in Asia, where four different countries receive more than $5 billion on an annual basis; every other country lags far behind. In short, a few key countries dominate the market.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;Top 10 Destinations for Remittances from the United States&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1.

We colored each state based on the political affiliation of the governor, then added a photo of the chief executive together with his or her salary. This approach creates a quick snapshot of their compensation, allowing for an easy comparison between states and political parties.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;First off, there are a lot more red than blue states on our map simply because Republicans tend to win governorships more often than Democrats. There are a lot of reasons for that, including how many gubernatorial elections happen during off-Presidential election cycles (there are&l;a href=\&q;https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/governor-race-ratings\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; 36 this year&l;/a&g;). More to the point, listing a salary on a map reveals the stark differences in compensation for governors in states right next to each other. For example, Jerry Brown (D) in California makes $75K more each year than Kate Brown (D) in Oregon. Brian Sandoval (R) in Nevada pulls in $50K more than Doug Ducey (R) next door in Arizona.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Keep in mind governors serve four-year terms, which makes the discrepancies that much more significant over time. OK, governors in&l;a href=\&q;https://ballotpedia.org/Governor_of_Vermont\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Vermont&l;/a&g; and&l;a href=\&q;https://ballotpedia.org/Governor_of_New_Hampshire\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; New Hampshire&l;/a&g; only serve two-year terms, but here&a;rsquo;s the point. Let&a;rsquo;s take the most extreme example. The highest paid governor in the country is Tom Wolf (D) from Pennsylvania, who pulls in an impressive $187,818 each year. That&a;rsquo;s good work if you can get it. The lowest is Paul LePage (R) in Maine, who only makes a&l;a href=\&q;https://www.pressherald.com/2017/02/16/lepage-likens-governors-pay-to-being-a-priest-or-a-nun/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; measly $70,000&l;/a&g;. Think about that&a;mdash;after four years, Wolf will make $471,272 more than LePage. Pennsylvania is a lot different than Maine, but they have the same job. An annual salary of $70K is certainly quite low for a governor, but it&a;rsquo;s still quite a bit higher than the&l;a href=\&q;http://www.businessinsider.com/us-census-median-income-2017-9\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; median income&l;/a&g; in the U.S., so let&a;rsquo;s not shed too many tears for LePage.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Another way to analyze the data is by making partisan comparison between Republicans and Democrats, and to make things fair, let&a;rsquo;s compare the two groups by looking at averages. The average Democratic governor&a;rsquo;s salary is $146,221 compared to $128,327 on the Republican side. As a matter of fact, 7 out of the 10 highest paid governors are Democrats, even though there are just 16 Democratic governors in the country compared to 33 Republicans (Gov.&l;a href=\&q;https://www.adn.com/politics/2017/08/21/alaska-gov-walker-files-to-run-for-re-election-as-an-independent/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Bill Walker&l;/a&g; from Alaska is the lone independent).&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1.

To generate our viz we first adjusted median income totals to account for inflation, also called real income, so that we could make true comparisons between different years. We then plotted figures for every year since 1997 on the same graph, revealing a quick snapshot of 20 years&a;rsquo; of economic history.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;GDP is an old school measure of the economy that originated during the industrial era. Many people think it&l;a href=\&q;https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21697845-gross-domestic-product-gdp-increasingly-poor-measure-prosperity-it-not-even\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; doesn&a;rsquo;t matter anymore&l;/a&g; because it fails to capture the changes in the quality of products in use at any given time. For example, GDP counts the physical costs of telegrams against the physical costs of email without considering the less tangible benefits of using the latter. GDP also ignores entire industries geared toward creating high-quality experiences (as opposed to physical products). That being said, it is still a shorthand way of measuring the health and trajectory of an economy, and it says a lot about both unemployment and wage growth. Developed countries like the United States typically have slower GDP growth than developing ones, like India or China.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Looking at the real median income figures tells an interesting story. The numbers have actually declined in 11 of the past 20 years, meaning that workers in general have smaller paychecks. As our graph demonstrates, wages are inversely correlated with employment. In other words, as employers shrink the number of individuals they employ the supply-and-demand effect allows them to pay their people less. Alternatively, &a;nbsp;when employment ticks up and labor becomes scarce, wages shoot back up. If the past is any indication,&l;a href=\&q;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-adds-200000-jobs-worker-pay-rises-at-fastest-pace-since-2009-2018-02-02\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; recent headlines&l;/a&g; suggest that American workers are due for another pay raise. In fact, in our graph 2016 was the best year for median incomes, rising 3.2% over the previous year to $59,039.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Things have generally been going well for American workers with GDP growth of 2-3% every year. Doubling that output to 5%, or even 6% as President Trump would like to see, would mean colossal and sustained gains in real wages for workers.

And since the federal gas tax is not pegged to inflation, gas could cost $10.00 a gallon and the feds would still only collect 18.4 cents. This situation might change as Congress and President Trump negotiate an&l;a href=\&q;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/white-house-says-its-willing-to-increase-the-federal-gas-tax-for-infrastructure/2017/10/26/1b459346-ba6d-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html?utm_term=.874d39d8a93c\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; infrastructure spending deal&l;/a&g;, but who knows? For now, total taxes only change on our map from one state to another based on that particular state&a;rsquo;s laws.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;There are two clear regions with high gasoline prices in the Northeast and across the Midwest. Hawaii ($3.34) and Alaska ($3.08) are outliers in the dataset because of their extreme distance from the continental U.S. Hawaii has a relatively high total tax burden of $0.64 built into its price, but Alaskans pay the lowest rate in the country of $0.31/gallon, of which only 12 cents goes to the state government. That&a;rsquo;s extraordinarily low because Alaska is one of the&l;a href=\&q;https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/production/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; top oil-producing states&l;/a&g;, and the government already collects so much money directly from oil companies that&l;a href=\&q;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alaska-residents-receive-smaller-oil-fund-payments/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; it actually pays its citizens&l;/a&g; every year. Anyway, there&a;rsquo;s also a group of light blue states across the South, where the tax burden is low and the price at the pump is relatively cheap. The least expensive state in the country is Texas, where it costs only $2.28. That&a;rsquo;s right, gas is cheaper than a&l;a href=\&q;https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/dybretail.pdf\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; gallon of milk ($2.33)&l;/a&g; in six states&a;mdash;Arkansas, South Carolina, Mississippi, Missouri, Alabama and Texas.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;All of this indicates how state and federal gas taxes are the primary reason why it costs more at the pump in some places than others. Take California for example. The state is obviously in a league of its own regarding taxation. The average cost for a gallon is $3.18, of which 22.6% goes to the state and federal governments. That tax represents $0.72 of the price for every gallon. In neighboring Arizona, the tax burden is only $0.37 on the gallon, and the average overall price is consequently much cheaper at $2.35 per gallon. It&a;rsquo;s simple&a;mdash;the more something is taxed, the more it costs.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;Top 10 States Where it is Most Expensive to buy a Gallon of Gas&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1. Hawaii: $3.34 and $0.64 for taxes&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;2. California: $3.18 and $0.72 for taxes&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;3.

New York: $2.69 and $0.63 for taxes&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;8. Connecticut: $2.68 and $0.58 for taxes&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;9.

Michigan: $2.64 and $0.61 for taxes&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;If President Trump proposes an increase in the federal gas tax, people living in these states are likely to feel it the most. They are already paying more than anyone else to fill up, and an increase in the federal tax will only make the situation worse. A better solution might be to peg the federal gas tax to inflation so that it rises and falls in tandem with the broader economy. This option would remove the issue as a hot-button political debate and ease the pain people feel when they hit the road.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Data: &l;a href=\&q;http://howmuch.net/sources/gas-prices-and-taxes\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Table 1.1&l;/a&g;&a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/gas-prices-and-taxes&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;This Map Shows How Gas Taxes Determine the Price at the Pump  https://howmuch.net/articles/gas-prices-and-taxes via @howmuch_net #Gas #Petrol #taxes #Fuel #petrolprice #USA #dataviz #money &q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;This Map Shows How Gas Taxes Determine the Price at the Pump&q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;President Trump is about to unveil a new infrastructure plan, which is rumored to include a hike in the federal gasoline tax.

The numbers reflect cash flows in 2016 leaving the U.S. to people in other countries through official channels, like a bank or wire transfer service. The data exclude cash flows through informal networks&a;mdash;think of sending cash through the mail&a;mdash;which economists suspect might add up to 50% to these totals. We placed the official statistics on a bubble chart, where the size of the circle corresponds to the total annual remittance for each country. We then color-coded each continent and included a percentage for easy reference. Our creative approach lends itself to several quick insights into global remittances leaving the U.S.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;First off, the Americas and Asia receive the majority of remittance payments, accounting for 42% and 39.8% of the total global cash flow, respectively. Europe, Africa and Australia and Oceana receive very little money in comparison. Mexico ($28.1B), China ($15.4B), India ($10.7B) and the Philippines ($10.5B) immediately stand out as the top four countries, making up a combined $64.7B in annual remittances, or almost half the entire market (47%, combined).&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;There are a lot of other interesting trends within each continent too. Generally speaking, remittances are not evenly spread out between countries&a;mdash;a select few dominate the market. Mexico is the obvious stand out in the Americas, but that&a;rsquo;s probably because of its physical proximity to the U.S. Instead, take a look at the Dominican Republic ($4.1B). Combined with Haiti ($1.4B), this one island would crack the top ten destinations for cash leaving the U.S. But just how big is the market for remittances to Mexico (at $28.1B? It&a;rsquo;s at an&l;a href=\&q;http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/02/news/economy/mexico-remittances/index.html\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; all-time high right now&l;/a&g;, and represents the equivalent of the entire&l;a href=\&q;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=PY&a;amp;view=map&a;amp;year_high_desc=true\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; economy of Paraguay&l;/a&g;. In other words, there&a;rsquo;s an enormous transfer of wealth happening year after year.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;There&a;rsquo;s a similar pattern on other continents too, where a select few countries receive a disproportionate share of remittances. Look at Africa, where Nigeria pulls in $5.7B every year. Or consider Europe, where Germany ($2.8B), France ($2.3B) and Italy ($1.4B) are the only three countries breaking the $1 billion mark. Things look similar in Asia, where four different countries receive more than $5 billion on an annual basis; every other country lags far behind. In short, a few key countries dominate the market.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;Top 10 Destinations for Remittances from the United States&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1. Mexico: $28.1B&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;2. China: $15.4B&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;3. India: $10.7B&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;4.

Nigeria: $5.7B&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;8. El Salvador: $4.2B&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;9. Dominican Republic: $4.1B&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;10. Honduras: $3.4B&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;We can summarize our map of remittances like this: when it rains, it pours. Cash flows accrue at different rates for different countries, and a select few tend to dominate the market. We can speculate about why this happens&a;mdash;perhaps once an immigrant population starts sending money, businesses spring up to facilitate the transfers, making it easier for more money to go overseas.

We colored each state based on the political affiliation of the governor, then added a photo of the chief executive together with his or her salary. This approach creates a quick snapshot of their compensation, allowing for an easy comparison between states and political parties.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;First off, there are a lot more red than blue states on our map simply because Republicans tend to win governorships more often than Democrats. There are a lot of reasons for that, including how many gubernatorial elections happen during off-Presidential election cycles (there are&l;a href=\&q;https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/governor-race-ratings\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; 36 this year&l;/a&g;). More to the point, listing a salary on a map reveals the stark differences in compensation for governors in states right next to each other. For example, Jerry Brown (D) in California makes $75K more each year than Kate Brown (D) in Oregon. Brian Sandoval (R) in Nevada pulls in $50K more than Doug Ducey (R) next door in Arizona.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Keep in mind governors serve four-year terms, which makes the discrepancies that much more significant over time. OK, governors in&l;a href=\&q;https://ballotpedia.org/Governor_of_Vermont\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Vermont&l;/a&g; and&l;a href=\&q;https://ballotpedia.org/Governor_of_New_Hampshire\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; New Hampshire&l;/a&g; only serve two-year terms, but here&a;rsquo;s the point. Let&a;rsquo;s take the most extreme example. The highest paid governor in the country is Tom Wolf (D) from Pennsylvania, who pulls in an impressive $187,818 each year. That&a;rsquo;s good work if you can get it. The lowest is Paul LePage (R) in Maine, who only makes a&l;a href=\&q;https://www.pressherald.com/2017/02/16/lepage-likens-governors-pay-to-being-a-priest-or-a-nun/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; measly $70,000&l;/a&g;. Think about that&a;mdash;after four years, Wolf will make $471,272 more than LePage. Pennsylvania is a lot different than Maine, but they have the same job. An annual salary of $70K is certainly quite low for a governor, but it&a;rsquo;s still quite a bit higher than the&l;a href=\&q;http://www.businessinsider.com/us-census-median-income-2017-9\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; median income&l;/a&g; in the U.S., so let&a;rsquo;s not shed too many tears for LePage.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Another way to analyze the data is by making partisan comparison between Republicans and Democrats, and to make things fair, let&a;rsquo;s compare the two groups by looking at averages. The average Democratic governor&a;rsquo;s salary is $146,221 compared to $128,327 on the Republican side. As a matter of fact, 7 out of the 10 highest paid governors are Democrats, even though there are just 16 Democratic governors in the country compared to 33 Republicans (Gov.&l;a href=\&q;https://www.adn.com/politics/2017/08/21/alaska-gov-walker-files-to-run-for-re-election-as-an-independent/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Bill Walker&l;/a&g; from Alaska is the lone independent).&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1.

We adjusted the size of each state according to the relative size of its Medicaid expenses, color-coding each one (dark red for over $50B, dark blue for under $1B). Our map quickly demonstrates where the highest- and lowest-spending states are across the country.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Let&a;rsquo;s back up for one second. Medicare and Medicaid are two programs that sound similar, but they work differently. Medicare works like Social Security&a;mdash;it covers anyone over 65 regardless of income. Medicaid, on the other hand, specifically provides health coverage to vulnerable people, like the poor. The federal government pays about half the cost of Medicaid depending on the state. Obamacare encouraged states to&l;a href=\&q;https://www.healthcare.gov/medicaid-chip/medicaid-expansion-and-you/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; expand Medicaid&l;/a&g; by footing most of the bill. But&l;a href=\&q;https://www.kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/the-coverage-gap-uninsured-poor-adults-in-states-that-do-not-expand-medicaid/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; 19 states&l;/a&g; didn&a;rsquo;t go along, meaning state governments fund Medicare at different levels, which creates wide disparities in the program around the country.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;How wide? Several red states immediately jump off the map. There are two main groups: a band stretching along the South from California to Texas and Florida, and a second cluster in the Northeast extending as far West as Illinois. Population size explains most of these numbers, but not all of them. For example, the five largest states&l;a href=\&q;https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2017/demo/popest/nation-total.html\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; by population&l;/a&g; are California, Texas, Florida, New York and Pennsylvania. These are the top-five Medicaid-spending states too, but in a slightly different order (see the list below). But the 8th biggest in the country, Georgia ($10.28), falls to the 17th place in terms of Medicaid expenditures. We suspect&l;a href=\&q;https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/georgia/articles/2017-03-15/georgia-governor-dont-punish-states-that-refused-expansion\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; state politics&l;/a&g; probably play a role in keeping things relatively inexpensive.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;The map also has two groups of low expenditure states. The first, concentrated primarily in the Deep South, has many states spending between $5B and $10B on an annual basis. The exceptions are places with several large cities, like Texas ($41.07B) and Florida ($22.46B). Another obvious trend is a massive gap running across the middle of the country, from North Dakota ($1.3B) down to New Mexico ($5.54B). These states appear small on our map because they spend so little money on Medicaid, typically not more than a few billion dollars.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;It&a;rsquo;s worth pausing for just a second to consider how vastly different Medicaid expenditures are between California ($88.69B) and Wyoming ($637M). No, that isn&a;rsquo;t a typo. California spends more on Medicaid than the bottom 25 states in the Union combined. That single budget item is bigger than the entire GDP of Bolivia (&l;a href=\&q;https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2017/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=43&a;amp;pr.y=19&a;amp;sy=2017&a;amp;ey=2017&a;amp;scsm=1&a;amp;ssd=1&a;amp;sort=country&a;amp;ds=.&a;amp;br=1&a;amp;c=512%2C672%2C914%2C946%2C612%2C137%2C614%2C546%2C311%2C962%2C213%2C674%2C911%2C676%2C193%2C548%2C122%2C556%2C912%2C678%2C313%2C181%2C419%2C867%2C513%2C682%2C316%2C684%2C913%2C273%2C124%2C868%2C339%2C921%2C638%2C948%2C514%2C943%2C218%2C686%2C963%2C688%2C616%2C518%2C223%2C728%2C516%2C558%2C918%2C138%2C748%2C196%2C618%2C278%2C624%2C692%2C522%2C694%2C622%2C142%2C156%2C449%2C626%2C564%2C628%2C565%2C228%2C283%2C924%2C853%2C233%2C288%2C632%2C293%2C636%2C566%2C634%2C964%2C238%2C182%2C662%2C359%2C960%2C453%2C423%2C968%2C935%2C922%2C128%2C714%2C611%2C862%2C321%2C135%2C243%2C716%2C248%2C456%2C469%2C722%2C253%2C942%2C642%2C718%2C643%2C724%2C939%2C576%2C644%2C936%2C819%2C961%2C172%2C813%2C132%2C199%2C646%2C733%2C648%2C184%2C915%2C524%2C134%2C361%2C652%2C362%2C174%2C364%2C328%2C732%2C258%2C366%2C656%2C734%2C654%2C144%2C336%2C146%2C263%2C463%2C268%2C528%2C532%2C923%2C944%2C738%2C176%2C578%2C534%2C537%2C536%2C742%2C429%2C866%2C433%2C369%2C178%2C744%2C436%2C186%2C136%2C925%2C343%2C869%2C158%2C746%2C439%2C926%2C916%2C466%2C664%2C112%2C826%2C111%2C542%2C298%2C967%2C927%2C443%2C846%2C917%2C299%2C544%2C582%2C941%2C474%2C446%2C754%2C666%2C698%2C668&a;amp;s=PPPGDP&a;amp;grp=0&a;amp;a=\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;$83.5B&l;/a&g;).&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;Top 10&a;nbsp;States with the Highest Medicaid Expenditures ($ mln)&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1.

To generate our viz we first adjusted median income totals to account for inflation, also called real income, so that we could make true comparisons between different years. We then plotted figures for every year since 1997 on the same graph, revealing a quick snapshot of 20 years&a;rsquo; of economic history.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;GDP is an old school measure of the economy that originated during the industrial era. Many people think it&l;a href=\&q;https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21697845-gross-domestic-product-gdp-increasingly-poor-measure-prosperity-it-not-even\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; doesn&a;rsquo;t matter anymore&l;/a&g; because it fails to capture the changes in the quality of products in use at any given time. For example, GDP counts the physical costs of telegrams against the physical costs of email without considering the less tangible benefits of using the latter. GDP also ignores entire industries geared toward creating high-quality experiences (as opposed to physical products). That being said, it is still a shorthand way of measuring the health and trajectory of an economy, and it says a lot about both unemployment and wage growth. Developed countries like the United States typically have slower GDP growth than developing ones, like India or China.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Looking at the real median income figures tells an interesting story. The numbers have actually declined in 11 of the past 20 years, meaning that workers in general have smaller paychecks. As our graph demonstrates, wages are inversely correlated with employment. In other words, as employers shrink the number of individuals they employ the supply-and-demand effect allows them to pay their people less. Alternatively, &a;nbsp;when employment ticks up and labor becomes scarce, wages shoot back up. If the past is any indication,&l;a href=\&q;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-adds-200000-jobs-worker-pay-rises-at-fastest-pace-since-2009-2018-02-02\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; recent headlines&l;/a&g; suggest that American workers are due for another pay raise. In fact, in our graph 2016 was the best year for median incomes, rising 3.2% over the previous year to $59,039.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Things have generally been going well for American workers with GDP growth of 2-3% every year. Doubling that output to 5%, or even 6% as President Trump would like to see, would mean colossal and sustained gains in real wages for workers.

We combined both datasets to color-code each circle on the map, representing how expensive a gallon of gas costs on average in each state. Dark blue circles indicate expensive prices over $3.00/gallon, and light blue indicates cheap fill ups under $2.50/gallon. Then, we added a second circle to represent both the state and federal taxes levied on gas. This approach transforms the complicated reality of energy taxes into an easily understandable map.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Several interesting trends are readily apparent. First off, the federal gas tax comes out to 18.4 cents on the gallon sold in every state. The amount was&l;a href=\&q;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/white-house-says-its-willing-to-increase-the-federal-gas-tax-for-infrastructure/2017/10/26/1b459346-ba6d-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html?utm_term=.874d39d8a93c\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; last adjusted&l;/a&g; 25 years ago in 1993, back when a gallon cost&l;a href=\&q;https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&a;amp;s=emm_epm0_pte_nus_dpg&a;amp;f=w\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; about $1.06&l;/a&g;. And since the federal gas tax is not pegged to inflation, gas could cost $10.00 a gallon and the feds would still only collect 18.4 cents. This situation might change as Congress and President Trump negotiate an&l;a href=\&q;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/white-house-says-its-willing-to-increase-the-federal-gas-tax-for-infrastructure/2017/10/26/1b459346-ba6d-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html?utm_term=.874d39d8a93c\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; infrastructure spending deal&l;/a&g;, but who knows? For now, total taxes only change on our map from one state to another based on that particular state&a;rsquo;s laws.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;There are two clear regions with high gasoline prices in the Northeast and across the Midwest. Hawaii ($3.34) and Alaska ($3.08) are outliers in the dataset because of their extreme distance from the continental U.S. Hawaii has a relatively high total tax burden of $0.64 built into its price, but Alaskans pay the lowest rate in the country of $0.31/gallon, of which only 12 cents goes to the state government. That&a;rsquo;s extraordinarily low because Alaska is one of the&l;a href=\&q;https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/production/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; top oil-producing states&l;/a&g;, and the government already collects so much money directly from oil companies that&l;a href=\&q;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alaska-residents-receive-smaller-oil-fund-payments/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; it actually pays its citizens&l;/a&g; every year. Anyway, there&a;rsquo;s also a group of light blue states across the South, where the tax burden is low and the price at the pump is relatively cheap. The least expensive state in the country is Texas, where it costs only $2.28. That&a;rsquo;s right, gas is cheaper than a&l;a href=\&q;https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/dybretail.pdf\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; gallon of milk ($2.33)&l;/a&g; in six states&a;mdash;Arkansas, South Carolina, Mississippi, Missouri, Alabama and Texas.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;All of this indicates how state and federal gas taxes are the primary reason why it costs more at the pump in some places than others. Take California for example. The state is obviously in a league of its own regarding taxation. The average cost for a gallon is $3.18, of which 22.6% goes to the state and federal governments. That tax represents $0.72 of the price for every gallon. In neighboring Arizona, the tax burden is only $0.37 on the gallon, and the average overall price is consequently much cheaper at $2.35 per gallon. It&a;rsquo;s simple&a;mdash;the more something is taxed, the more it costs.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;Top 10 States Where it is Most Expensive to buy a Gallon of Gas&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1. Hawaii: $3.34 and $0.64 for taxes&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;2. California: $3.18 and $0.72 for taxes&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;3. Alaska: $3.08 and $0.31 for taxes&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;4. Washington: $2.94 and $0.68 for taxes&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;5. Oregon: $2.83 and $0.55 for taxes&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;6. Pennsylvania: $2.82 and $0.77 for taxes&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;7. New York: $2.69 and $0.63 for taxes&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;8. Connecticut: $2.68 and $0.58 for taxes&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;9. Nevada: $2.68 and $0.52 for taxes&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;10. Michigan: $2.64 and $0.61 for taxes&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;If President Trump proposes an increase in the federal gas tax, people living in these states are likely to feel it the most. They are already paying more than anyone else to fill up, and an increase in the federal tax will only make the situation worse. A better solution might be to peg the federal gas tax to inflation so that it rises and falls in tandem with the broader economy. This option would remove the issue as a hot-button political debate and ease the pain people feel when they hit the road.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Data: &l;a href=\&q;http://howmuch.net/sources/gas-prices-and-taxes\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;Table 1.1&l;/a&g;&a;nbsp;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;/articles/gas-prices-and-taxes&q;,&q;twitterText&q;:&q;This Map Shows How Gas Taxes Determine the Price at the Pump  https://howmuch.net/articles/gas-prices-and-taxes via @howmuch_net #Gas #Petrol #taxes #Fuel #petrolprice #USA #dataviz #money &q;,&q;ogTitle&q;:&q;This Map Shows How Gas Taxes Determine the Price at the Pump&q;,&q;ogDescription&q;:&q;President Trump is about to unveil a new infrastructure plan, which is rumored to include a hike in the federal gasoline tax.

The numbers reflect cash flows in 2016 leaving the U.S. to people in other countries through official channels, like a bank or wire transfer service. The data exclude cash flows through informal networks&a;mdash;think of sending cash through the mail&a;mdash;which economists suspect might add up to 50% to these totals. We placed the official statistics on a bubble chart, where the size of the circle corresponds to the total annual remittance for each country. We then color-coded each continent and included a percentage for easy reference. Our creative approach lends itself to several quick insights into global remittances leaving the U.S.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;First off, the Americas and Asia receive the majority of remittance payments, accounting for 42% and 39.8% of the total global cash flow, respectively. Europe, Africa and Australia and Oceana receive very little money in comparison. Mexico ($28.1B), China ($15.4B), India ($10.7B) and the Philippines ($10.5B) immediately stand out as the top four countries, making up a combined $64.7B in annual remittances, or almost half the entire market (47%, combined).&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;There are a lot of other interesting trends within each continent too. Generally speaking, remittances are not evenly spread out between countries&a;mdash;a select few dominate the market. Mexico is the obvious stand out in the Americas, but that&a;rsquo;s probably because of its physical proximity to the U.S. Instead, take a look at the Dominican Republic ($4.1B). Combined with Haiti ($1.4B), this one island would crack the top ten destinations for cash leaving the U.S. But just how big is the market for remittances to Mexico (at $28.1B? It&a;rsquo;s at an&l;a href=\&q;http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/02/news/economy/mexico-remittances/index.html\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; all-time high right now&l;/a&g;, and represents the equivalent of the entire&l;a href=\&q;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=PY&a;amp;view=map&a;amp;year_high_desc=true\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; economy of Paraguay&l;/a&g;. In other words, there&a;rsquo;s an enormous transfer of wealth happening year after year.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;There&a;rsquo;s a similar pattern on other continents too, where a select few countries receive a disproportionate share of remittances. Look at Africa, where Nigeria pulls in $5.7B every year. Or consider Europe, where Germany ($2.8B), France ($2.3B) and Italy ($1.4B) are the only three countries breaking the $1 billion mark. Things look similar in Asia, where four different countries receive more than $5 billion on an annual basis; every other country lags far behind. In short, a few key countries dominate the market.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;Top 10 Destinations for Remittances from the United States&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1. Mexico: $28.1B&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;2. China: $15.4B&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;3. India: $10.7B&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;4.

Nigeria: $5.7B&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;8. El Salvador: $4.2B&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;9. Dominican Republic: $4.1B&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;10. Honduras: $3.4B&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;We can summarize our map of remittances like this: when it rains, it pours. Cash flows accrue at different rates for different countries, and a select few tend to dominate the market. We can speculate about why this happens&a;mdash;perhaps once an immigrant population starts sending money, businesses spring up to facilitate the transfers, making it easier for more money to go overseas.

We colored each state based on the political affiliation of the governor, then added a photo of the chief executive together with his or her salary. This approach creates a quick snapshot of their compensation, allowing for an easy comparison between states and political parties.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;First off, there are a lot more red than blue states on our map simply because Republicans tend to win governorships more often than Democrats. There are a lot of reasons for that, including how many gubernatorial elections happen during off-Presidential election cycles (there are&l;a href=\&q;https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/governor-race-ratings\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; 36 this year&l;/a&g;). More to the point, listing a salary on a map reveals the stark differences in compensation for governors in states right next to each other. For example, Jerry Brown (D) in California makes $75K more each year than Kate Brown (D) in Oregon. Brian Sandoval (R) in Nevada pulls in $50K more than Doug Ducey (R) next door in Arizona.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Keep in mind governors serve four-year terms, which makes the discrepancies that much more significant over time. OK, governors in&l;a href=\&q;https://ballotpedia.org/Governor_of_Vermont\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Vermont&l;/a&g; and&l;a href=\&q;https://ballotpedia.org/Governor_of_New_Hampshire\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; New Hampshire&l;/a&g; only serve two-year terms, but here&a;rsquo;s the point. Let&a;rsquo;s take the most extreme example. The highest paid governor in the country is Tom Wolf (D) from Pennsylvania, who pulls in an impressive $187,818 each year. That&a;rsquo;s good work if you can get it. The lowest is Paul LePage (R) in Maine, who only makes a&l;a href=\&q;https://www.pressherald.com/2017/02/16/lepage-likens-governors-pay-to-being-a-priest-or-a-nun/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; measly $70,000&l;/a&g;. Think about that&a;mdash;after four years, Wolf will make $471,272 more than LePage. Pennsylvania is a lot different than Maine, but they have the same job. An annual salary of $70K is certainly quite low for a governor, but it&a;rsquo;s still quite a bit higher than the&l;a href=\&q;http://www.businessinsider.com/us-census-median-income-2017-9\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; median income&l;/a&g; in the U.S., so let&a;rsquo;s not shed too many tears for LePage.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Another way to analyze the data is by making partisan comparison between Republicans and Democrats, and to make things fair, let&a;rsquo;s compare the two groups by looking at averages. The average Democratic governor&a;rsquo;s salary is $146,221 compared to $128,327 on the Republican side. As a matter of fact, 7 out of the 10 highest paid governors are Democrats, even though there are just 16 Democratic governors in the country compared to 33 Republicans (Gov.&l;a href=\&q;https://www.adn.com/politics/2017/08/21/alaska-gov-walker-files-to-run-for-re-election-as-an-independent/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Bill Walker&l;/a&g; from Alaska is the lone independent).&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1.

We will leave it to you to draw your own conclusions about exactly why.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;Editor&a;#39;s Note:&l;/strong&g;&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;A previous version of this article ignored the fact that Gov.

We adjusted the size of each state according to the relative size of its Medicaid expenses, color-coding each one (dark red for over $50B, dark blue for under $1B). Our map quickly demonstrates where the highest- and lowest-spending states are across the country.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;Let&a;rsquo;s back up for one second. Medicare and Medicaid are two programs that sound similar, but they work differently. Medicare works like Social Security&a;mdash;it covers anyone over 65 regardless of income. Medicaid, on the other hand, specifically provides health coverage to vulnerable people, like the poor. The federal government pays about half the cost of Medicaid depending on the state. Obamacare encouraged states to&l;a href=\&q;https://www.healthcare.gov/medicaid-chip/medicaid-expansion-and-you/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; expand Medicaid&l;/a&g; by footing most of the bill. But&l;a href=\&q;https://www.kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/the-coverage-gap-uninsured-poor-adults-in-states-that-do-not-expand-medicaid/\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; 19 states&l;/a&g; didn&a;rsquo;t go along, meaning state governments fund Medicare at different levels, which creates wide disparities in the program around the country.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;How wide? Several red states immediately jump off the map. There are two main groups: a band stretching along the South from California to Texas and Florida, and a second cluster in the Northeast extending as far West as Illinois. Population size explains most of these numbers, but not all of them. For example, the five largest states&l;a href=\&q;https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2017/demo/popest/nation-total.html\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; by population&l;/a&g; are California, Texas, Florida, New York and Pennsylvania. These are the top-five Medicaid-spending states too, but in a slightly different order (see the list below). But the 8th biggest in the country, Georgia ($10.28), falls to the 17th place in terms of Medicaid expenditures. We suspect&l;a href=\&q;https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/georgia/articles/2017-03-15/georgia-governor-dont-punish-states-that-refused-expansion\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; state politics&l;/a&g; probably play a role in keeping things relatively inexpensive.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;The map also has two groups of low expenditure states. The first, concentrated primarily in the Deep South, has many states spending between $5B and $10B on an annual basis. The exceptions are places with several large cities, like Texas ($41.07B) and Florida ($22.46B). Another obvious trend is a massive gap running across the middle of the country, from North Dakota ($1.3B) down to New Mexico ($5.54B). These states appear small on our map because they spend so little money on Medicaid, typically not more than a few billion dollars.&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;It&a;rsquo;s worth pausing for just a second to consider how vastly different Medicaid expenditures are between California ($88.69B) and Wyoming ($637M). No, that isn&a;rsquo;t a typo. California spends more on Medicaid than the bottom 25 states in the Union combined. That single budget item is bigger than the entire GDP of Bolivia (&l;a href=\&q;https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2017/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=43&a;amp;pr.y=19&a;amp;sy=2017&a;amp;ey=2017&a;amp;scsm=1&a;amp;ssd=1&a;amp;sort=country&a;amp;ds=.&a;amp;br=1&a;amp;c=512%2C672%2C914%2C946%2C612%2C137%2C614%2C546%2C311%2C962%2C213%2C674%2C911%2C676%2C193%2C548%2C122%2C556%2C912%2C678%2C313%2C181%2C419%2C867%2C513%2C682%2C316%2C684%2C913%2C273%2C124%2C868%2C339%2C921%2C638%2C948%2C514%2C943%2C218%2C686%2C963%2C688%2C616%2C518%2C223%2C728%2C516%2C558%2C918%2C138%2C748%2C196%2C618%2C278%2C624%2C692%2C522%2C694%2C622%2C142%2C156%2C449%2C626%2C564%2C628%2C565%2C228%2C283%2C924%2C853%2C233%2C288%2C632%2C293%2C636%2C566%2C634%2C964%2C238%2C182%2C662%2C359%2C960%2C453%2C423%2C968%2C935%2C922%2C128%2C714%2C611%2C862%2C321%2C135%2C243%2C716%2C248%2C456%2C469%2C722%2C253%2C942%2C642%2C718%2C643%2C724%2C939%2C576%2C644%2C936%2C819%2C961%2C172%2C813%2C132%2C199%2C646%2C733%2C648%2C184%2C915%2C524%2C134%2C361%2C652%2C362%2C174%2C364%2C328%2C732%2C258%2C366%2C656%2C734%2C654%2C144%2C336%2C146%2C263%2C463%2C268%2C528%2C532%2C923%2C944%2C738%2C176%2C578%2C534%2C537%2C536%2C742%2C429%2C866%2C433%2C369%2C178%2C744%2C436%2C186%2C136%2C925%2C343%2C869%2C158%2C746%2C439%2C926%2C916%2C466%2C664%2C112%2C826%2C111%2C542%2C298%2C967%2C927%2C443%2C846%2C917%2C299%2C544%2C582%2C941%2C474%2C446%2C754%2C666%2C698%2C668&a;amp;s=PPPGDP&a;amp;grp=0&a;amp;a=\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g;$83.5B&l;/a&g;).&l;/p&g;\n\n&l;h3&g;Top 10&a;nbsp;States with the Highest Medicaid Expenditures ($ mln)&l;/h3&g;\n\n&l;p dir=\&q;ltr\&q;&g;1.
