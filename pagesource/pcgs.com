                            <p>John Agre is the owner of Coin Rarities Online, a full service online coin dealership offering choice examples of colonial, federal and world coins, with a focus on colonial &amp; early American issues.</p>
<p>He has been a colonial collector and enthusiast since the late 1960&rsquo;s, eventually becoming a full-time dealer in 2005. Since that time, John (via his business at Coin Rarities Online) has bought and sold choice examples of nearly every colonial type and most varieties, and has assisted in building many of the finest collections extant today.</p>
<p>Through the years John has devoted much of his spare time to developing a comprehensive photographic condition census of all colonial &amp; early American coins, generating the most accurate assessments yet of colonial populations and in the process has re-united countless rare and important coins with long-lost pedigrees.</p>
<p>When John is not assisting us with the colonial section of the PCGS CoinFacts site, or helping with the PCGS Colonial Coin Price Guide, he can be found at <a href="http://www.CoinRaritiesOnline.com.">http://www.CoinRaritiesOnline.com</a>.</p>

                            <p>David Akers started collecting coins in 1949. After graduating from Notre Dame, obtaining a Masters degree in mathematics from Oregon State, and serving as a U.S. Army combat artillery officer in Viet Nam, David became a full time coin dealer in 1971. He was President of one of the largest and most influential dealerships of the 1970s and 1980s, Paramount International Coin Corp</p>
<p>Between 1975 and 1982, David Akers published a six volume analysis of U.S. gold coins that is considered one of the key references for the market. He conducted numerous very important auctions, including the three part 1997-99 sale of the legendary John J. Pittman collection. He is one of only two dealers to ever receive all three of the Professional Numismatists Guild's three top honors: the Robert Friedberg Literary award, the Abe Kosoff Founders award, and the PNG Lifetime Achievement award. David Akers is considered one of the top rare gold experts of all-time. He contributed to PCGS&nbsp;CoinFacts and gave valuable insight and help on the PCGS Million Dollar Coin Club project.&nbsp; Mr. Akers passed away in 2012.</p>

                            <p>Ron Gillio is prehaps the best known coin dealer in the world. He started buying and selling coins in 1961 and since 1970, he has traveled extensively throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia buying and selling U.S. and world coins and currency. In his career, Ron has handled many rarities, including two of the most famous U.S. coin rarities, the 1913 Liberty nickel and the 1894-S dime. He has been one of the largest importers of U.S. gold coins. Since 1970, he has imported more than 1,000,000 U.S. gold coins from various Swiss banks and Central Government Banks in Europe. In 1996, Ron found, negotiated and purchased the famous Wells Fargo hoard, the largest hoard of high quality U.S. $20 gold pieces in history.</p>
<p>Ron Gillio has owned auction companies in the United States, Hong Kong, and Singapore. He put on his first coin show in the San Fernando Valley in 1967 and was the owner of the very important Long Beach&nbsp;coin show (which he now runs on behalf of Collectors Universe) for many years. Ron has perhaps the broadest base of coin and currency knowledge of anyone in the world as he has handled an incredibly wide spectrum of rare coins and currency from virtually every country in the world. In 1983, Ron collaborated with Walter Breen in writing and publishing the standard reference book for California Fraction Gold. Today these historically important coins trade according to their BG (Breen-Gillio) numbers.</p>
<p>Ron was on the Board of the Professional Numismatists Guild for 17 years, serving in all of the PNG's officer positions, including President. In 1995, Ron Gillio was given the PNG's Abe Kosoff Founders Award for his significant contributions to the numismatic community.</p>

                            <p>Kevin Lipton started buying and selling coins at age thirteen and within a few years earned a reputation as one of the great numismatic prodigies. At only 16 years old, he was the full-time numismatic buyer for Steve Ivy Rare Coins of Dallas (the firm that became Heritage). At only seventeen years of age, he started his own company, Kevin Lipton Rare Coins, and was one of the major players in the rare coin market, handling some of the rarest U.S. coins and being involved of many of the largest deals of the era. In 1989, Kevin Lipton was the chief advisor to the American Rare Coin Fund L.P., Kidder Peabody&rsquo;s $25,000,000 rare coin limited partnership. In 2000, Lipton was the recipient of the Professional Numismatist Guild&rsquo;s "Sol Kaplan Award" for his help in cleansing the profession of fraud and thievery.</p>
<p>For PCGS CoinFacts, Kevin Lipton is one of the four members of the pricing committee for the Million Dollar Coin Club, the PCGS CoinFacts listing of the approximately 200 U.S. coins now worth a million dollars or more. Kevin is obviously one of the most qualified persons in the world to offer guidance on the pricing of these ultra rare coins.</p>
<p>Kevin Lipton is one of the greatest coin traders of all-time and has handled most of the important United States coin rarities. He has sold over one billion dollars worth of high quality rare coins. Today he remains one of the largest and most active buyers and sellers of U.S. rare coins. He attends every major coin show and participates in every major coin auction. He is one of the top buyers of U.S. coin rarities. Those interested in selling (or buying) U.S. coin rarities can contact Kevin at his office weekdays at 310-712-8118.</p>

The Spectrum Group family of companies include numismatic auction powerhouse Stacks Bowers, one of the country's largest rare coin wholesalers Spectrum Numismatics, and one of the country's largest gold and silver dealers A-Mark. <br /> <br /> Here's what PCGS founder and CoinAge Magazine Numismatist of the Century David Hall has to say about Greg Roberts. "When Greg was a 15 year old sophomore in high school (1977) his mom used to drive him to the Glendale coin show where he sold me Gem BU Mercury dimes, Walkers, and silver dollars he had bought around town. Then I watched him become a significant buyer/market-maker for dollars and Walkers. In the 1990's, he graduated to Ultra Rarities and bought and sold 1913 Liberty nickels, 1804 dollars, etc. Today, I believe he buys and sells (though his several dominant companies) more U.S. coins than any other person/firm in this country. I have been somewhat of a mentor to him, giving him advice along the way, and doing a ton of business with him. Now I ask him for advice. The student has become the master!" <br /> <br /> Greg&rsquo;s companies can be checked out at <a href="http://www.stacksbowers.com">stacksbowers.com</a> and <a href="http://www.spectrumnumismatics.com">spectrumnumismatics.com</a>.</p>
