stop selling major outdoor brand with NRA ties.</a> It announced that it would no longer be ordering CamelBak, Bell, Giro or any other of the 50 Vista Outdoor brands to sell in its stores.
</p>

<p>
Let's see. I own a knock off CamelBak hydration pack, not the original. And I have a Giro helmet from 10 years ago. I am not going to buy from these brand from the time being. Guns are lethal weapons. I prefer to buy my merchandise not from people with association with gun makers and NRA.
</p>

<p>
I will make my next purchase in REI for appreciation.

<div id="story" class="blogbody">

<p>
I made my first trip with <a href="https://www.jumpbikes.com">JUMP bike</a> last night. Their bikes are AWESOME! I'm a hardy bicyclist. I ride all over the city and charge up hills with gusto. I own another electric cargo bike myself. It makes it practical for me to carry my child to Presidio and conquer the hill in the middle.
</p>

<p>
Still JUMP bike impress me the moment I begin. As soon as I step on the pedal, the electric motor deliver an oomph that push the bike forward from complete stop, precisely when I need the boost most. Riding around town is quick and relatively effortless. Reservation, unlocking, and completing the ride work seamlessly. It only cost me $2 per ride. Dockless bike sharing is the way to go. JUMP bike is a wonderful choice I highly recommend.</p>

I gathered a whole stack of books in front of me. These are a selection of books I have bought but have yet to read. There are also a handful of books I want to re-read. My new year resolution is to make significant deduction of them in a year.
</p>

<p>
There are coffee table book that I can go through in a day. However, some of them are mathematics books that I might not make much progress in a year. That's why they have accumulated.

I opened this linguistic book. Inside the book, the yellowing first page has two dates. Chloe, an English major in CUHK, first bought the book. She was done with it and sold it to me because I have general interest. That was 1993. After 25 years of procrastination, perhaps I will finally get to it.

<p>
Here is a great quote from Bertrand Russell. His target is the French philosopher Henri Bergson, but it just as applicable to anyone from the anti-intellectual fraction.
</p>

<blockquote><i>
One of the bad effects of an anti-intellectual philosophy, such as that of Bergson, is that it thrives upon the errors and confusions of the intellect. Hence it is led to prefer bad thinking to good, to declare every momentary difficulty insoluble, and to regard every foolish mistake as revealing the bankruptcy of intellect and the triumph of intuition.

</p>

<div id="story" class="blogbody">

<p>
5am on Embarcadero, the still dark boulevard was bustling with athletics preparing for the run. It took 30 minutes for my middle wave to propagate to the starting line. There the bell ringer ringed the ceremonial cable car bell. Ding. Ding. Ding. Off we go.
</p>

<p>
We filled the familiar San Francisco streets and waterfront, overran the hill by Fort Mason, passed the Philz Coffe truck that was already opened in Marina Green. Then we scaled the hill that lead to the Golden Gate Bridge. It was fog shrouded, completely fog shrouded. While we were running on the windy bridge deck, the fog horn was blowing the deep deep sound below. Just another day at the Golden Gate. And this day I was running on it.
</p>

<p>
We went pass the residentals in Richmond and arrived at the Golden Gate Park. Here we splitted up with our half Marathon friends. The atmosphere changed a good deal. Now people had thinned out with only half as many runners going down a much wider road. Tall trees flanked both side of the road still shrouded in fog. It was tranquil and peaceful. It was magical.
</p>

<p>
As we returned to the city streets, the sun had finally broken through. People gathered on the street to cheer the runners. There were band stands. Some people offer few drink to runners. I had high fived at least fifteen people along the way. It was such a festival. Their encouragement helped me to squeeze my last bit of reserve. I kept going and made it to the finish line.

</p>

<div id="story" class="blogbody">

<p>
I have taken a short walk in the streets of Mandalay. The busy street were full of activities. Open air food stalls are all over the place well liked by locals. The streets are lined with all kinds of small businesses. Motorcycles crisscross the streets carrying people to all the places.
</p>

<figure class="center_layout">
    <img src='/2017/img/mandalay_street2.jpg' width="800px"/>
    <figcaption>Choked Street in Mandalay</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
There was a problem though. I have not been to any city where walking is as aggravating as in Mandalay. There are no connected sidewalk in Mandalay. People there freely use the sidewalk space as their front yard, blocking it for storage, parking, market stalls, setting restaurant tables or simply walling it off. The encroachment extend well into the road. The picture shows how difficult walking can be. A red car freely parked mid street next to the vendor, further constricting the already choked road. Be very careful to walk around them, because motorcycles can come from anywhere! I was quite challenged by how to proceed forward from there.
</p>

<figure class="center_layout">
    <img src='/2017/img/yangon_street.jpg' width="800px"/>
    <figcaption>Yangon Street</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Yangon is a much more lovely city in comparison. It is lot more populous than Mandalay. But the old town is quite nice to walk. The food vendors are operating in a space that enhance the street life rather than cutting off access.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
People adapted to their way of life. Perhaps I was overly agitated by the difference? I walked by a group of teenagers who were literally using the busy street as their football field. They were setting up goal post out there, running around and shooting the ball, oblivious to passing traffic. I did not witness anyone getting knock down. Yes, there were a lot of honking from cars and motorcycles. But they always managed to miss each other. People survive somehow.

<p>
When I go to vacation, I usually packed the days with activities. I spend all these time and money to go to a faraway places, I want to make the most of my time. I usually use the hotel mainly for sleeping.
</p>

<p>
This morning I woke up at 6am to run. I covered 15 miles. When I returned to the hotel it was only 11am. I was so tired I took a bath and then slept for an hour and didn't care for other things. Damn it, I paid for this resort-y hotel I am allowed to sleep in!

Intel is so longer a semiconductor firm selling microprocessors only. It is going into the commercial drone business. The company will begin selling a heavy-duty drone for industrial use such as as inspecting power lines, construction zones or oil and gas rigs.

I have been an <a href="http://tungwaiyip.info/blog/2014/02/02/mooc_2013_review">avid learner</a> of MOOC courses since this format debut in 2012. It is often said, despite the large number of people signed up, most did not complete the course, that is if they started at all. Few turned in home work or did any required work. Even fewer went through tests and exams. At the end no more than 5% of students would have completed all lectures, home works and exams.

I swear this is not a lake. Look at the tree stumps. They used to be a shaded parkland where we can sit to watch the kids play. Rain runoff has filled up this part of the park, turning it into a swamp. Now ducks have discovered it. They are quite at home in this new pond.

So I completed my first half marathon yesterday from the Golden Gate park, along with other 5,000 participants. I got a blister a few days before the race. And I was anxiously checking an impending storm forecast to hit on the day. None of this has affected it. It was a fabulous day. The weather was great the energy was superb. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

<div id="story" class="blogbody">

<p>
Today I made another long run in Presidio and Golden Gate Bridge. There are so many wonderful sights on way, it is just magical! I ran by <a href="http://www.presidio.gov/places/andy-goldsworthys-wood-line">Andy Goldsworthy's Wood Line</a>. I love love love this sinuous log line emerged in the forest! Then it was the Yoda statue. Fans have setup a impromptu memorial for the just departed Carrie Fisher by the fountain. From there it headed down to the beautiful lagoon at the Palace of the Fine Arts. Then the open air by the shoreline in Crissy Field. Then climbed up the giant bridge structure and crossed the water of the beautiful bay. It returned by the scenic cliff side trail on the Pacific coast. Finally back to the wood to another sculpture of Andy Goldsworthy - <a href="http://www.presidio.gov/places/andy-goldsworthys-spire">the Spire</a>. The 10.5 miles loop has to be one of the best trail in the world!

Recently I have noticed I was reading five books at the same time. So I decided to track how I was doing with them. Everyday I logged down the pages I have read. After one and half month, the progress is shown in the chart below.

</p>

<div id="story" class="blogbody">

<p>
The Golden Gate Park is beloved of its museums, sports fields, lawns and forests. Not as well known is that it is dotted with a string of lakes. In all I have counted nine lakes of significant size. I have decided to visit them all today in my run. Each of them was pictured below.

<div id="story" class="blogbody">

<p>After lunch, I went to Tilly's coffee shop, one of my favorite spot in the neighborhood. The atmosphere in the Sunday afternoon was very relaxing. I sat next to a young couple who were studying with their computer. Most other people, there were a few older ones, were just sitting and passing time. I was supposed to work on the homework assignment for my writing class tomorrow. Instead I found myself browsing on the computer, reading news, and commenting on Internet forum. Before long I have emptied my drink. I was disappointed that I still have not written a single word. Resigned, I packed up and headed to grocery shopping before returning home.
