	<h1>Freelance Graduate Academic Writers </h1>
<h2>Immediate Start</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold"> Are  you a graduate or postgraduate degree holder, i.e., BSc, BA, MSc, MA,  MBA or PhD? Are you looking for a flexible part time/full time job  that fits your lifestyle? Do you excel at academic writing? Can you  meet deadlines?</p>
<br/>
<p>  Platinum  Research are heading towards a very busy period in our working  calendar and are therefore in a position to take on a variety of  part-time and full-time writers, proof-readers and quality assessors.  We are looking for high quality graduates in every major subject area  to help us fulfil orders for our customers. To be considered you,  must have a minimum of a high 2:1 undergraduate degree and have  qualified from a respectable university within the UK. Further  qualifications such as a Masters or PhD are also highly desirable and  would thus make you suitable for more available pieces. Experience in  the writing industry is not essential but preferred. To qualify as a  quality assessor we would normally expect you to have a PhD and have  experience marking and critiquing the work of students.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Freelance  writers at Platinum Research are expected to produce high-quality  work for our customers, usually within a timeframe of five days. All  orders need to be of the highest quality and submitted within set  deadlines. All work will be based upon the requirements of our  clients and you will sometimes be required to complete amendments at  short notice depending on feedback by the client. At Platinum  Research we strive for customer satisfaction and offer to go the  extra mile for our clients. After all happy clients are returning  clients, which means more work for you.</p>
<p> As  a professional freelance writer, you will need to have access to  sources from which you will be able to reference, making this  position especially suitable for Masters and PhD students. It would  also suit postgraduate students who are keen to expand their writing  skills and knowledge of particular or different subject areas.</p>
<p> We  receive orders and enquiries for all types of writing and research in  a wide variety of subject areas. Understandably however we do receive  more work from some particular disciplines. We currently have a  shortage of writers in Business, Economics, Education, Law,  Management, Nursing, Psychology and Statistics (SPSS / e-views) in  particular. We do however need people in all subject areas to start  work as soon as possible. Therefore, regardless of your discipline,  if you have the necessary qualifications then we would encourage you  to apply today.</p>
<p> In  return for your valued skills, you will be able to earn an average  rate of £48 per 1000 words, with higher rates for more specialist  work and tighter deadlines. You will have expert assistance from the  team at Platinum Research who will be on hand to help with any  questions and/or queries you may have to make things go as smoothly  as possible.</p>
<p> We  are currently entering a very busy period and therefore have a lot of  work waiting to be taken by qualified and enthusiastic freelance  writers. Though most of our work does come from some specific  disciplines, it is advisable to apply no matter what your  qualification as we are always on the lookout for good academic  writers from all areas of study.</p>
<p> To  apply to work for Platinum Research, you must reside in the United  Kingdom, have evidence of your academic status (degree  qualifications) and evidence of your academic writing (samples etc.).  We will also ask to see two forms of identification and also proof of  your address.</p>
