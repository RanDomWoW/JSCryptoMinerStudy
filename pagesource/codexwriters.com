	QuoteArray[12] = "I mean we can call him Ishmael or we can call him stupid. Dude, just get off the boat already. -- " + james_beamon;
	QuoteArray[13] = "I think the idea isn't to footbind the story, but to find it a comfy pair of shoes that will let it run where it wants to, and to pay more attention to critiquers who say 'I think I see what the story wants to be when it grows up, and here's how to help it' and less to 'WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT DOESN'T WANT TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL?!' school of criticism. -- " + anatoly_belilovsky;

	QuoteArray[19] = "I tend to fall into the camp of everyone is selfish and narcissistic and there's no such thing as altruism. Which is strange to write down since I'm generally an optimistic and sentimental person who frequently tears up when *describing* Hallmark commercials. -- " + helena_bell;

	QuoteArray[26] = "I don't think how the story gets started is significant. Partially because no matter how big the initial idea, it's still small compared to everything else that must be generated. But more importantly because I think just starting is the key, whether that's motivated by shot of creative juice or a deadline or whatever -- " + john_brown;
	QuoteArray[27] = "I'm a medical professional, yet repeatedly I don't know anything compared to that one time someone's uncle got sick, and then got better, because someone waved an incense stick with fierce intent over his head. -- " + erin_cashier;

	QuoteArray[36] = "The 'rules' are nothing more than a guide to steer you away from the most commonly made mistakes. But you know what? You can follow every one of the rules and still write a turd. -- " + doug_cohen;
	QuoteArray[37] = "My wife is the smartest person I ever met. I try to keep up intellectually with her (have tried for 38 years now), and our personal narrative usually tends to be fairly &quot;high-brow&quot; and a bit formal in its tone. Yet, what would I say if Cthulthu burst through the front door and ripped her head off with his tentacles? It probably wouldn't be: &quot;Odd, that.&quot;<br />Well, maybe it would. But probably not. --  " + gary_cuba;

	QuoteArray[39] = "Look up at the night sky. The Pleiades are real. The Milky Way's real. Alcor and Mizar are (probably) an item. They're gravitationally bound systems; just about every other pattern you can see is your brain checking the place out for sabre-toothed tigers. -- " + robert_dawson;

	QuoteArray[49] = " Fiction is powerful; it gives us vicarious experiences so we can become far wiser than our own small lives would otherwise allow. Writing things that are painful or scary or heartbreaking can give our readers practice in dealing with these emotions in a protected environment, experience that may be able to help them cope with similar feelings when they occur in real life.<br />I'd argue that these may be the most important stories for us to tell. --  " + dt_friedman;
	QuoteArray[50] = " I'll be spending a LOT of time reading up on malaria and leishmaniasis and babesiosis and everything else.<br />I'm so excited! --  " + dt_friedman;

	QuoteArray[53] = "What, you don't just want to walk into your local morgue and ask, 'What's the best way for someone to steal a body from you?' -- " + nancy_fulda;
	QuoteArray[54] = "The internet is cool, but it ain't the whole world. -- " + nancy_fulda;
	QuoteArray[55] = "Romance, thriller and mystery novels are all defined based on the type of events the reader can expect to occur. But SF? Fantasy? Sky's the limit. All the genre tells you is whether to expect phasers, handguns, or fireballs. -- " + nancy_fulda;
	QuoteArray[56] = "Ironically, the editors who complain that the story needs a plot may actually mean: 'This story has not yet fulfilled its potential as an artwork of plotless magnificence.' -- " + nancy_fulda;
	QuoteArray[57] = "Forget Writers of the Future. Quotedex is the TRUE measure of your ability as a writer. -- " + nancy_fulda;

	QuoteArray[67] = " Aesthetics.<br />&quot;This.&quot;<br />is prettier and cleaner than<br />&quot;This&quot;.<br />That period at the end just hangs there like dribble on a toilet seat. --  " + sarah_grey;
	QuoteArray[68] = "If you're a perfectionist, it's probably good advice to just keep drafting, don't look back, don't overthink and don't put too much pressure on the book to be Great.<br />If you're a halfasser (like me), it's useful to think hard about where the book is going even in the first draft, and get it right. --  " + kate_heartfield;
	QuoteArray[69] = "If a short story doesn't set an editor on fire in THE FIRST TWO MINUTES, it should probably get rejected. -- " + jason_heller;

	QuoteArray[71] = "(Sarcastically) We need a story about a writer named Mary Sue who comes to New York city to find love and career success and finds a publisher husband who makes all of her dreams come true for her. I'm thinking she's a scifi writer to start, but of course we scifi writers are all geeks with big glasses and unfashionable clothes, and her writing is very sophisticated space opera stuff that doesn't 'feel' like a woman's writing, so the publisher man isn't attracted to her at first and in fact mistakes her for a man. But then her stereotypical gay neighbor takes her on a makeover montage, and gets her a job writing advice columns on how a woman can make her man happy, and BAM! Magic happens! That would be complete awesomeness. -- " + randy_henderson;
	QuoteArray[72] = "A policy is someone who is like the police, but not actually the police. 'That mall cop is very policy.' -- " + randy_henderson;
	QuoteArray[73] = "Writers are like bears. They're more scared of you than you are of them. -- " + erica_hildebrand;
	QuoteArray[74] = "Sometimes the stories fight like banshees, other times they come in like tribbles. (Usually mine are Africanized banshees.) -- " + larry_hodges;
	QuoteArray[75] = "I've submitted three stories to Fantasy & Science-Fiction magazine post-John Joseph Adams. Response times (from day mailed to rejection received in mail): 6 days, 12 days, 6 days. This is like molasses compared to JJA, where sometimes I'd be writing the first paragraph and I'd hear shouting, and I'd open my window and it'd be JJA outside my window shouting, 'No! No! No!' I've got a drawer full of rejections from him for stories I haven't even thought up yet. -- " + larry_hodges;
