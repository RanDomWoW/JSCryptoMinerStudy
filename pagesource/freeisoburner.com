<h4>About ISO image</h4>
<p>
An ISO image is an archive file (a.k.a. disk image) of an optical disc using a conventional ISO (International Organization for Standardization) format that is supported by many software vendors. ISO image is an unattached file format (like RAR and ZIP): it merges a series of files into one single file according to a definite format. ISO image files typically have a file extension of .ISO but Mac OS X ISO images often have the extension .CDR. 
</p>
<p>
The name "ISO" is taken from the ISO 9660 file system used with CD-ROM media. ISO 9660 is a standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), defines a file system for CD-ROM media. It aims at supporting different computer operating systems such as Windows, classic Mac OS, and Unix-like systems, so that data may be exchanged.
