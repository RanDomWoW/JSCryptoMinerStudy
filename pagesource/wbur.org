Back then, Moulton's trip to the first presidential caucus state fueled speculation he was considering a presidential run of his own, butÂ Moulton said he was there to advocate for a slate of fellow veterans and Democrats running for Congress.","\"Twelve veterans who I have endorsed so far in swing districts across the country &mdash; exactly the districts that we need to take back if we're going to take back the House,\" Moulton said. \"One of my messages here is: hope is on the horizon. There's help on the way, and it's coming in the form of a new generation of Democrats who understand public service, and who are going to start winning again.\"","\u003Cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","Moulton's slate of endorsed candidates is now up to 19 veterans. Lamb is one of them. Moulton raised nearly $80,000 for Lamb, canvassed door-to-door with him and had six of his staff members working in Pittsburgh. The efforts helped Lamb beat Rick Saccone, a four-term Pennsylvania state representative in a district that Trump carried by 20 points in 2016.","\"Some people have credited me with recruiting some of these veterans to run, and there's a few I did encourage,\" Moulton said.Â \"But the best recruiter out there is our commander-in-chief, Donald Trump. He's the one who's convinced so many veterans to stand up and take on the Republican establishment, to take on the president, and serve the country again.\"","Moulton is among many who call Lamb's victory a big defeat for Trump and Republicans. Lamb ran as a moderate Democrat: a Marine veteran, who promised to oppose Democratic House Leader Nancy Pelosi, and whose campaign ad featured a picture of him shooting an AR-15-style assault rifle.","Some Republicans caution reading too much into Lamb's victory.","\"Lamb basically ran as a Republican,\" D. Raja, treasurer of the Pennsylvania Republican Party, said earlier this week on Fox News. \"And the phrase that I would like to say is, here's a 'Lamb' in Republican clothing. Lamb says he's pro-life, pro-gun ... he says he's pro all of that, and unfortunately, I do not think Conor Lamb will deliver once he gets elected in all those facets.\"","\u003Cspan data-index=\"2\" data-type=\"youtube\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","\"It's a ridiculous attack line, like so many of the Republican attacks on him,\" Moulton said. \"He has Democratic positions up and down the list, but they're positions that reflect the will of his district.\"","Lamb is pro-gun rights, but in favor of universal background checks. Personally opposed to abortion, but unwilling to upend abortion rights. And supportive of medical marijuana. Boston-based Democratic consultant Dan Payne says these positions place Lamb squarely among mainstream Democrats.","\"He opposed the Trump tax cut, he is for maintaining ObamaCare,\" Payne says. \"And if he's so close to the Republican Party and Trump, why did they spend $10 million trying to defeat him?\"","\u003Cspan data-index=\"3\" data-type=\"pullquote\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","Payne is among many who believe Lamb's victory signals a big challenge for Republicans as they try to keepÂ their majorities in Congress in the age of Trump. Lamb's victory was fueled by an energized electorate that included college-educated suburban progressives and blue-collar labor. Moulton says Lamb was a candidate who understood his district, and that his experience as a veteran gave him credibility.","\"Now we have a new generation of leaders who have seen the consequences of failed leadership in Washington in places like Iraq and Afghanistan,\" Moulton said. \"I think you see the generation of veterans who went to Iraq and Afghanistan taking over for the generation who sent us there.\"","Veterans like Lamb are in a unique position to challenge what's wrong with Washington, Moulton says.

They didn't understand it. And they didn't think children would get it.

I mean at the end of the movie, Camazotz is destroyed it appears. But they have to go. They have to go back home. And one of the things that the movie does as well as the book is show that there's darkness at home as well. But that's not hopeless because what Meg has learned and what we have learned through her and through this new universal vision of Meg that Ava has given us is that we can overcome it.

So I think a film adaptation of a beloved book is difficult. WhatÂ Ava has done is she's given us what she sees in the book. And it's going to be different from what I see or what you see or what anybody else sees.","\u003Ci\u003EMeghna: So let me put a finer point on it. People have been writing about the biggest thing, the biggest theme that may be missing from the movie and that is the religious or spiritual themes that Madeleine L'Engle weaves through the entire novel. Now there's a deep profound sense of secular empowerment in the movie version. But Madeleine L'Engle was unafraid to write a book that was about spiritual power. And I don't know why Hollywood was so afraid to pull that into a modern day film. And I kind of wish that Ava DuVernay had.

And conversely the absence of the Bible or Christian themes doesn't mean it doesn't have something to say about those deeply spiritual themes. So that is that is one criticism I really disagree with. I think it's just important to understand that just because something isn't explicit doesn't mean it's not there.

He and his fiancÃ©e, Martina KusnÃ­rovÃ¡, an archaeologist, were shot dead in their bungalow in a small village in Slovakia's countryside.

It was the third wave of mass protests across Slovakia in recent weeks, which have been the largest since the Velvet Revolution in 1989 that brought down communism in what was then Czechoslovakia.","One protester in Bratislava was lawyer Zuzana JurÃ­kovÃ¡, 33, who denounced Thursday's resignation as nothing more than a show, given Fico is still the head of his party and the incoming prime minister is a trusted deputy.","\"The big theater, we want to end it,\" she said. \"The same, leading party is over there in the parliament, so nothing changed, only some men [in] the posts.\"","Another protester was JÃ¡n OrlovskÃ½, who heads Slovakia's Open Society Foundations. \"We have lots of these skeletons in the closet, which we need to address and one of the skeletons is corruption,\" he said, adding that because it's deeply ingrained in society, Slovaks tend to put up with it.","But the murders \"really shook us to the bones,\" OrlovskÃ½ said. \"It's not just, you know, a little money here, a little money there. You can actually die.\"","Fico and his party had campaigned in part on eliminating corruption, but critics say no one of import has ever been convicted.

It means that groups should have systems in place to prevent abuse and misconduct.","At the safeguarding summit held on March 5 in London, Britain's secretary for international development Penny Mordaunt said the government will put safeguarding standards in place that organizations must meet in order to be funded.","\"These standards will include an assessment of codes of conduct, how organizations identify and respond to incidents and how their risk management places safeguarding and beneficiaries at the very core,\" Mordaunt said. \"Organizations should not bid for new funding unless they are prepared to meet these tough new standards.\"","\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.interaction.org\u002Fusers\u002Flindsay-coates\"\u003ELindsay Coates\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, president of InterAction, an alliance of nearly 200 U.S.-based nonprofits that do international work, is calling for three key areas of focus: taking complaints seriously and responding to the complainants, making sure these individuals have access to services, and pushing anyone who is \"predatory\" out of the system.","\"We're not fixing anything if someone who works for the U.N. goes to [a nongovernmental organization\u002Faid group] and there's no communication between the U.N. and the NGO,\" Coates says.","Oxfam has developed a list of steps the organization plans to take in response to the \"crisis.\" On Thursday, it announced the leaders of its new Independent Commission on Sexual Misconduct, Accountability and Culture Change. Among other measures, Oxfam said it has \"committed to work with others in the sector on a humanitarian passporting system that would stop offenders from moving from one organization to another.\"","That idea of a \"passport\" issued to all aid workers is still very much a work in progress. Basically, all employees would have a permanent record of infractions.","Save the Children also included the passport on a list of proposed steps to address concerns about the aid sector, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.savethechildren.org.uk\u002Fnews\u002Fmedia-centre\u002Fpress-releases\u002Fsave-the-children-proposes-ways-to-tackle-concerns-about-aid-sec\"\u003Epublished on Feb. 12\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.","\"Any staff members reprimanded or dismissed for sexual harassment, bullying and a failure of protection are identified and cannot disappear back into the system,\" the organization writes. \"Establishing a common registry and passport system would identify if all necessary background checks have been carried out and retain details of all previous conduct.\"","The passport is just one of many proposals.

Dina Francesca Haynes, director of the Human Rights and Immigration Law Project at the New England School of Law, says there are too many variables.","\"Who would fund this? Who would appoint?

Besides the traditional dangers of crossing this busy body of water in a small craft, the years 1914 to 1918 featured the additional danger of German submarines, which targeted all enemy vessels (not just military ones) and sunk many.","This was the challenge that Guinness steam ships, cargo full of stout, faced every day crossing the Irish Sea from Dublin to their destination, Liverpool, in the northwest of the United Kingdom. The trip was about 135 miles and took most of a day, depending on the weather.","The W.M. Barkley was the pride of the Guinness fleet. Guinness bought it from Belfast shipbuilder, John Kelly &amp; Sons in 1913, just a year before the war erupted. Then, because of the conflict, the ship was requisitioned by the British Admiralty for the war effort. (Ireland was still part of the UK at this time, so it was a legal act of government.) By 1917, the ship was deemed unsuitable for its wartime mission and returned to Guinness for commercial use.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"pullquote\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","On October 12, 1917 the Barkley set off from DublinÂ on its fateful trip to Liverpool, with its cargo of stout and a crew of 13. Nearly three hours into its journey, disaster struck: A torpedo from the German UC-75 submarine hit the ship and split it in two.","The crew, shocked and jolted, went scurrying for a lifeboat. As the story goes, the shipâs cook, Thomas McGlue, had been making a cup of tea when the impact of the torpedo tossed the hot water, scalding his arm. By the time he got to the lifeboat, the sun had set and the ship was sinking. âThe Barkley was doing her best to go down but the [beer] barrels were fighting their way up through the hatches and that kept us afloat a bit longer,â McGlue toldÂ the \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.irishships.com\u002Fguinness_boats.html#THE%20SINKING%20OF%20THE%20S.S.W.M.BARKLEY\"\u003EGuinness HARP magazine\u003C\u002Fa\u003E in 1964\u003Cstrong\u003E.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EÂ âIn fact, itâs the reason any of us got out of there.â","The floating barrels of stout in the cargo hold made it possible for eight of the 13 souls aboard to escape into the night aboard a lifeboat.","Now &mdash; away from the sinking ship &mdash; the surviving crew was questioned by the captain of the German submarine about the sunken boatâs identity. The German captain checked the Barkley off his âhit listâ and bid the sunken shipâs crew good night, pointing them in the general direction of the Irish coast.","After rowing a while, they set down the life boatâs anchor and shouted all night for rescue. Around five oâclock the next morning, they were rescued by a passing ship and ferried back to Dublin.","Torpedo attacks in the Irish Sea were so frequent at the time, that when the crew went to report their ordeal to government officials at the Customs House, they waited three hours to be interviewed. Eventually, they gave up waiting and went to the Guinness brewery instead.","There, the superintendent gave them a swig of brandy &mdash; even Guinness employees recognize that some situations merit stronger stuff &mdash; and sent them home.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"2\" data-type=\"pullquote\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","The remains of the \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.infomar.ie\u002Fdata\u002FShipwrecks\u002FBox50\u002Fpdfs\u002FWMBarkley_Final.pdf\"\u003EW.M.

And complications for all abortions are \"rare,\" the report says.","But the report did find that state laws and regulations can interfere with safe abortions.","\"Abortion-specific regulations in many states create barriers to safe and effective care,\" the report says.","Calonge says those rules often have no basis in medical research.","\"There are some requirements that require clinicians to misinform women of the health risks, that say you have to inform a woman that an abortion will increase her risk of breast cancer,\" he says.","There is no evidence that breast cancer follows abortion, for example, but \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.guttmacher.org\u002Fgpr\u002F2006\u002F10\u002Fmisinformed-consent-medical-accuracy-state-developed-abortion-counseling-materials\"\u003Efive states\u003C\u002Fa\u003E require doctors to tell women there is a link, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that focuses on reproductive and sexual health.","\"There are policies that mandate clinically unnecessary services like pre-abortion ultrasounds, separate inpatient counseling. There are required waiting periods,\" Calonge says.","According to Guttmacher, 27 states make women wait at least 24 hours for an abortion and 11 states require women to have an ultrasound before they can terminate their pregnancy.","And there are state laws that dictate who can perform abortions and where they can do them. Some require all abortions to happen in the equivalent of a hospital or surgery center. Others require a doctor to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.","The National Academies report says waiting periods and requirements for unnecessary tests can result in long delays because women may have to travel to get care and have trouble getting appointments.","\"Delays put the patient at greater risk of an adverse event,\" the report says.","Hal Lawrence, the CEO of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, says the report settles the debate over abortion-restricting laws and regulations. ","\"Those sorts of laws have been totally debunked,\" he says. ","He says the study shows most of those laws do nothing to improve women's health. ","\"Abortion is safer when it's performed earlier in gestation,\" Lawrence says. \"And so delaying and making people wait and go through hoops of unnecessary, extra procedures does not improve the safety. And actually by having them delay can actually worsen the safety.\" ","The U.S. Supreme Court in 2016 voided some state abortion laws when it ruled that Texas' strict rules around abortion facilities impose an undue burden on women. But other laws remain in place even without any backing in medical research.","Still, Donna Harrison says there are good reasons for the requirements.","\"The tendency to look at abortion as though it were not a serious medical procedure is irresponsible. I mean, we all know that the fetus is killed during an abortion but women can be harmed by irresponsible medical care,\" says Harrison, the executive director of the \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Faaplog.org\u002F\"\u003EAmerican Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.","She says data on complications from abortion is incomplete because doctors and patients don't always report it accurately, or at all.","\u003Cem\u003E\"\u003C\u002Fem\u003EThere is no good data collection â and when you have garbage in, and you have garbage out,\" she says.","And she says waiting periods are important so that women can give fully informed consent before they undergo what she says is a sometimes dangerous, surgical procedure.","The new report â which runs more than 200 pages â addresses most aspects of abortion care, including the use of the abortion pill \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.accessdata.fda.gov\u002Fdrugsatfda_docs\u002Flabel\u002F2000\u002F20687lbl.htm\"\u003Emifepristone\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.","For example, it concludes that the strict requirements on how doctors can administer mifepristone may need review. The researchers say the rules may be erecting unnecessary barriers. ","The report also says nurse practitioners and physician assistants can perform abortions just as safely as physicians.","Also, abortions have no long-term consequences on women's physical and mental health, the report says.

following its internal investigation into allegations of sexually abusive conduct towards young artists, has responded by suing the Met and its General Manager Peter Gelb.","\"The Met, lacking contractual authority, suspended Maestro Levine without even the courtesy of a conversation regarding the substance of the allegations or the basis of his suspension,\" the lawsuit begins. It goes on to accuse the Met of \"McCarthyite tactics\" due to the organization's protection of the privacy of Levine's accusers, a common practice for employers when presented with accusations of this type.","Levine's complaint points out that the Met was aware of the 2016 police report filed against him, but \"took no disciplinary action.\" It also accuses the company of \"cynically hijacking the good will of the #MeToo movement,\" and says that Gelb and the Met \"brazenly seized on these allegations as a pretext to end a long-standing personal campaign to force Levine out of the Met and cease fulfilling its legally enforceable financial commitments to him.\"","Levine is seeking at least $5.85 million in damages, in part over breach of his employment contract as music director emeritus, a position the Met created specifically for him and in which he was meant to serve until 2026.","The Met Opera \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.metopera.org\u002FAbout\u002FPress-Releases\u002FStatement\u002F\"\u003Erebutted\u003C\u002Fa\u003E Levine's suit publicly yesterday, writing: \"There is no basis for Mr. Levine's assertion that the Met was on a vendetta against him, when in fact the Met supported him through prolonged and repeated periods of illness that kept him from the podium, at one point spanning two entire seasons.\"","It continues: \"During the course of the investigation, Mr. Levine was offered numerous opportunities to be interviewed, beginning in December. It was only when the investigation was wrapping up, upon realization that termination was imminent, that he agreed to be interviewed, but on impossible terms, asking that the identity of his accusers, who had been promised anonymity, be disclosed.\"","In its statement on firing Levine as the Met Opera's music director emeritus and artistic director of its young artist program issued earlier this week, the organization wrote that its investigation had \"uncovered credible evidence that Mr. Levine had engaged in sexually abusive and harassing conduct both before and during the period when he worked at the Met.\" Levine first conducted at the institution in the early 1970s, and was only removed as an employee earlier this week â a period of nearly half a century.","The controversy around Levine, while said to have been rumored for some time, became public after a police report was furnished to the press in early December 2017. The report, filed two years ago in Illinois, alleged Levine had assaulted the pianist and violinist Ashok Pai while the artist was a teenager in the late 1980s.

Published this month by the journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology (widely known as âThe Green Journalâ), it distills the latest research on 19 topics and makes clear where data is lacking.","\"This is a very balanced review,\" said Dr. Aviva Lee-Parritz, chief of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Boston Medical Center.","The list includes some commonsense reminders, she said, including that pregnant women, like everyone else, should wear a seat belt. (The small potential risk to the developing baby from wearing one is outweighed by the significant risk of being in an accident without one.)","And, Lee-Parritz said, it counters some of the cultural messaging that pushes women to be overly restrictive during pregnancy.","Women looking for absolute answers wonât find many here. In most cases, readers still need to decide for themselves how much uncertainty they can manage. But Fox offers a concise tool to help &mdash; and definitely moreÂ reliable data than the commenters in that online pregnancy forum youâve been trawling. The full article is \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Finsights.ovid.com\u002Fcrossref?an=00006250-900000000-98116\"\u003Ehere\u003C\u002Fa\u003E,Â but his main points include:","\u003Cstrong\u003Eâ¢ Donât worryÂ if you miss a prenatal vitamin.Â \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EPregnant women need to be sure they get adequate amounts of folic acid, vitamin D, iron and calcium. If you have a healthy diet, a prenatal vitamin may not do much for you or your baby. Vitamin supplements are important forÂ women who are undernourished. ForÂ those with a nutritious diet, it âis likely not required,â Fox writes.","\u003Cstrong\u003Eâ¢Â Avoid alcohol\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E (but that one glass of wine is probably OK). Heavy drinking is clearly linked to problems in the fetus. But Fox points to several large studies that have found no link between a motherâs light or moderate drinking and developmental or behavioral problems in their children later in life.","\"It doesnât mean there are zero problems with it,\" Fox said. \"It just means that we have never been able to find one.\" So what does he tell his patients who ask about having a glass of wine here and there? He canât promise itâs perfectly safe, but it doesnât appear to be dangerous.","\u003Cstrong\u003Eâ¢Â Do indulge in that morning coffee.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Another beverage, another moral dilemma. Most data suggests that low-to-moderate caffeine consumption is safe, Fox writes.","Dr. Monica Mendiola, an OB-GYN at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said she tells her patients who are regular coffee drinkers that they can drink a cup of coffee daily or take a Tylenol to cope with the headaches theyâll have if they stop. Neither is harmful.","\u003Cstrong\u003Eâ¢Â Sure, have some sushi.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E And \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.fda.gov\u002FFood\u002FResourcesForYou\u002FConsumers\u002Fucm393070.htm\"\u003Eeat fish\u003C\u002Fa\u003E &mdash; the cooked kind &mdash; regularly, but avoid species that are high in mercury. Warnings against eating raw fish during pregnancy are mostly prompted by fear of parasites that are uncommon in developed countries and âare also not particularly dangerous,â Fox writes.","\u003Cstrong\u003Eâ¢Â Donât do bed rest.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Even if your grandmother says you need it, you almost certainly do not. Bed rest once was recommended for a wide variety of complications and concerns during pregnancy. The latest data shows it is not beneficial in preventing preterm birth or pregnancy loss, and it could be associated with risks, Fox writes.","\u003Cstrong\u003Eâ¢Â Do exercise. \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EItâs good for you. Fox recommends an average of 20Â to 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exerciseÂ -- that means you can still talk while doing itÂ -- four or five times a week.","\u003Cstrong\u003Eâ¢Â Do feel free to get it on.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E For many women, there comes a point when you just canât. Youâre too big, too tired, tooÂ -- everything. But thereâs no medical reason to avoid sex at any point in pregnancy, for most women.","Fox writes that itâs not clear whether sex could increase the risk of bleeding or infection in women who have vaginal bleeding or whose membranes have ruptured. And while there are no clear data to support it, doctors generally recommend that women whose cervix is covered by the placenta, called placenta previa, avoid sex after 20 weeks to prevent bleeding.","\u003Cstrong\u003Eâ¢Â Do travel, if youâd like.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Air travel is safe while pregnant, Fox writes. Compression socks and getting up frequently is a good idea on longer flights. Whether (or when) to stop traveling as the end of pregnancy approachesÂ -- and as the risk of some complications increasesÂ -- is an individual choice, to be weighed against the benefit of the trip, Fox writes.","As for the newer backscatter X-rays at security? No need to forgo them for a patdown, Fox said. The radiation exposure from the scan is about 1\u002F600th the amount of cosmic radiation received during the flight itself.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003Eâ¢Â Donât smoke cigarettes.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Theyâre not good for anybody. If you canât quit entirely, then reduce smoking as much as possible, Fox writes. Nicotine replacement is acceptable for cessation. Vaping, sometimes used to quit cigarettes, may not be. There is not adequate research on vapingâs effect on pregnancy, Fox writes: âLogically, (electronic nicotine delivery systems) should not be more dangerous than smoking, but it is possible they are not as safe as other nicotine replacements such as patches and gum.â","\u003Cstrong\u003Eâ¢Â Marijuana is probably not a good idea, either.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E It is not linked to any adverse outcomes, but it also hasnât been studied enough, Fox writes. Marijuana use among pregnant women \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fjamanetwork.com\u002Fjournals\u002Fjama\u002Ffullarticle\u002F2594398\"\u003Ehas been growing\u003C\u002Fa\u003E in the United States. And some have used it to deal with nausea during pregnancy. Beth Israel's Mendiola said there are other ways of dealing with nausea. \"Just because we donât know what [marijuana] is causing, doesnât mean itâs not causing harm,\" she said.","\u003Cstrong\u003Eâ¢Â Donât panic when you wake up on your back.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Many pregnant women go to bed each night with a pile of pillows and a mantra of âleft is bestâ playing in their head. Itâs thought that lying on the left side aids circulation to the baby and lying supine is linked to stillbirth.","But, Fox writes, the studies that made that link were limited because they were based on what women recalled about their past behavior, which can be imperfect. Plus, Fox writes, thereâs no data that shows side-sleeping actually prevents stillbirths.","Mendiola said she hears often from women worried that they started out the night on their side and woke up on their back. Her response is simple: âThatâs OK.â","\u003Cem\u003EChelsea Conaboy is a freelancer who writes often about health care.

He asked for help sliding an Elsa (from âFrozenâ) watch &mdash; once loved and then discarded by his big sister &mdash; over his tiny wrist, pushing it up his arm until it fit snugly around his elbow. Then, he hardly looked at it. Instead, he started yelling.","Siri, play Cars!","Siri, play Trolls!","Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr! Siri! Siri! Siriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!","There was no response, of course &mdash; from Siri, or Elsa, or anyone. He started swinging his arm around angrily, yelling âSiri!â at the top of his lungs until I finally implored him, âWes, stop screaming at that watch!â","Why was he shouting at this obviously not-smart watch? And even if he thought itâd respond, why did he get so angry?","\u003Cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"pullquote\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","Well, like most of the bad habits children pick up, heâd learned it from his parents, or, more specifically: he learned it from me. He has seen me speak commands into my Apple watch countless times and usually, Siri responds on cue.","And yes, admittedly, if Siri doesnât respond immediately &mdash; or with the intended result &mdash; I get frustrated. I may even raise my voice at her from time to time.","Did you catch that? I wroteÂ \u003Cem\u003Eher\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. Not him. Not it. To me, Siri is female. I could choose a male voice, but thatâs not Siri to me, not really.","Smart home products like the Amazon Echo and Google Home were top sellers last holiday season and, like Siri, the disembodied voices that live inside those devices are also female. Or, rather, their voices sound like female voices, so we think of them as female.","They are the personal assistants that live inside our phones, watches and smart home devices. They are also more fully developed robots. âTonight Showâ host Jimmy Fallon engaged in an awkwardÂ \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=Bg_tJvCA8zw\"\u003Econversation\u003C\u002Fa\u003EÂ on his show with Hanson Roboticsâ Sophia.

And, traditionally, administrative assistants &mdash; the roles that Siri, Alexa and the like, purportedly fill &mdash; have been women.","But maybe this offloading of administrative tasks to artificial intelligence is an opportunity to rethink, rather than rehash, the status quo.","Itâs problematic that we often treat the all-female artificial intelligence administrative workforce inhumanely. Think of the way we get their attention: âHey Siri!â or, more curtly, âAlexa!â Or, how weÂ react when they donât do as theyâre told. I already admitted to raising my voice sometimes, and now my kids do too. We would never talk to their mother, my wife, that way. (And thatâs to say nothing of the inappropriate questions Siri is asked: âWhat are you wearing?â is a popular one.)","As the tide of our culture turns in the wake of the #MeToo movement and women everywhere are emboldened to speak out against the abuse and harassment, sexual or otherwise, perhaps this is also the moment to speak up on behalf of virtual assistants.","I decided to try out the male voice that Apple offers for Siri. My kids had mixed reviews.Â Nelly, myÂ daughter prefers the female voice, âbecause itâs so pretty.â Wes, on the other hand, said, âI want to do the daddy one.â My wife likes the male voice, but thinks he should have a different name. (She suggested âFrank.â)","Changing the voices of our virtual assistants is one option. But thatâs only a band-aid solution. I ought to be more careful about how I interact with Siri: No more raising my voice or getting easily frustrated. Iâve even started saying âpleaseâ and âthank you.â","Fortunately, good habits catch on quickly in our family. We got a Google Home Mini for Christmas and the kids' favorite thing is to ask is, âHey Google, tell me a joke â¦ please.â","The jokes arenât great, but we still say âthank you.â","\u003Cem\u003EFollow Cognoscenti on \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.facebook.com\u002Fcogwbur\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003EFacebook\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fcogwbur\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ETwitter\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, and sign up for our twice-weekly \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fvisitor.r20.constantcontact.com\u002Fmanage\u002Foptin?v=001_E1ee4Kj9gBjf5py2sBtL074y9MCDvqmv-rdf-HTFLwOZVhG8Vb50dU9rGjsDw_-jFLuS9f0y7t99KIS2XnvAxqh65OydDo7TvLftNvVBao%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003Enewsletter\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E"],"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[{"url":"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fonpoint\u002F2018\u002F01\u002F09\u002Fdoes-artificial-intelligence-need-a-code-of-ethics","title":"Does Artificial Intelligence Need A Code Of Ethics?","prefix":"On Point:"},{"url":"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fcognoscenti\u002F2017\u002F12\u002F19\u002Fhey-google-julie-wittes-schlack","title":"Will The Lure Of Convenience Give Way To The Surveillance State?","prefix":"Julie Wittes Schlack:"},{"url":"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fnpr\u002F577969778\u002Fwhat-your-smart-devices-know-about-you","title":"What Your Smart Devices Know About You","prefix":""}],"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":"","broadcastDate":"","broadcastTime":"","itunesEpType":"","itunesEpNum":0,"itunesTitle":"","itunesSummary":"","itunesExplicit":false,"volume":3,"disqus":null,"googlePick":false,"suppressAudio":false,"audioDatetime":null,"pullquotes":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":70,"type":"category","name":"Life","slug":"life"},{"id":71,"type":"category","name":"Media","slug":"media"},{"id":73,"type":"category","name":"News","slug":"news"},{"id":74,"type":"category","name":"Opinion","slug":"opinion"},{"id":75,"type":"category","name":"Politics","slug":"politics"},{"id":78,"type":"category","name":"Technology","slug":"technology"}],"audio":[],"embedMeta":{"embed-1":{"id":1,"parentID":231924,"type":"pullquote","attributes":null,"body":"Itâs problematic that we often treat the all-female artificial intelligence administrative workforce inhumanely.","placeholder":"\u003Cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"pullquote\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E"},"embed-2":{"id":2,"parentID":231924,"type":"youtube","attributes":{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=Bg_tJvCA8zw"},"body":"","placeholder":"\u003Cspan data-index=\"2\" data-type=\"youtube\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E"}},"images":[{"type":"featured","url":"\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2018\u002F01\u002FAP_17355694915242.jpg","width":1700,"height":1242,"title":"TEC--Smart Speakers-Buyers Guide","caption":"In this Wednesday, Sept. 27, 2017, file photo, a new Amazon Echo is displayed during a program announcing several new Amazon products by the company, in Seattle.

Now, the MIT researchers have illuminated \u003Cem\u003Ehow\u003C\u002Fem\u003E more talking actually changes a child's brain &mdash; and it's not just about the number of words a child hears, Romeo said. It's about interaction, the number of conversational \"turns\" that parents and preschool-aged children took while wearing recorders that taped their every word over two days.","And the effect didn't depend on parents' income or education, she noted, so it's not as if lower-income children are \"doomed\" to weaker verbal abilities.","\"It seems to suggest, instead, that if they're provided with a rich verbal environment early in life, that that can predict great language and cognitive outcomes,\" Romeo said.","TheÂ finding isÂ an important addition to work over the last 20-plus years onÂ language development, said Dr. Marilyn Augustyn, a behavioral pediatrician at Boston Medical Center who was not involved in the study. She praised its use of brain scanners and recording devices to move the research forward.","A previous study turned up similar MRI findings on children who were read to by their parents, she said, \"But what's really revolutionary about this study &mdash; and why I think it's really important &mdash; is it did both: It looked at the conversations, the words that children heard, and then also looked at the brain activation.\"","It strengthens a two-part message, she added. \"One, we need to talk to our children from the moment they're born, and probably in utero. And two, that language needs to come out of a relationship &mdash; and that's what this study really cements. It isn't about streaming tape to a child through the course of a day with thousands and thousands of words, because those become meaningless. It's really about the relationship.\"","The next step in the research, Romeo said, will be to study an early intervention that gives toddlers more back-and-forth conversations.","\"Obviously a two-year-old is not going to debate philosophy with you, but just a back and forth with them, whatever their capabilities are, is really valuable,\"Â she said.","The study found a broad range in how many conversational \"turns\" parents and child took in the course of an hour, from just 90 to as many as 400, Romeo said.","Families under more stress &mdash; say, with parents holding down more jobs &mdash; may have a harder time changing their conversational interactions with children, Gabrieli acknowledged. \"But it is a thing &mdash; a very specific thing &mdash; that any of us could do with the right encouragement and support,\" he said.","Passively watched screens clearly do notÂ bring the same sort of interaction as real conversation. But could a smart speaker use artificial intelligence to develop a child's brain much as a conversational parent would?","That question will require more study, the researchers said. Some initial research suggests that if devices can really respond to what a child says, they may offer added benefits, Romeo said.","But Dr. Augustyn is skeptical. Children can become very connected to technology, she said, but even if they develop some sort of relationship with a smart speaker, ultimately, \"Alexa doesn't have a lap.\""],"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[],"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":"segment","broadcastDate":"2018-02-14
