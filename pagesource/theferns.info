<h1>Welcome to theferns.info!</h1>
<!-- 
If you are reading this then i assume you have done one of three things:
  1: you pressed view source to find some sloppy html on my site to look at and feel superior about, no chance of that :D
  2: you are a slightly retarded website creator who is trying to work out how i did some simple bit of formating on this page, good luck, but i doubt you will work it out....
  3: you are a very bored individual who has been staring at this page for two minutes and has decided to click "view source" cos you couldn't think of anything better to do.
if none of the above, then please feel superior that you have outwitted me, and go and view the source of anothor page.

<p><del>ANOTHER EDIT: Smegging hell....... just over 48 hours now :-( this is criminal web-mania (are they torturing me deliberately?))</del></p>

<p><del>YET ANOTHER EDIT: Oh smeg, what the smegging smeg are they smegging doing? they'r smegging killing me...(72 hours, by the way)</del></p>
<p><del>ONE MORE EDIT: Ok, it's over 120 hours, well, who thinks the domain might be registered now?</p></del>
