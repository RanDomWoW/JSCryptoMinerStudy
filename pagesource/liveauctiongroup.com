					Bringing an auction business to the internet is an obvious and inevitable decision.
					The auction business, not unlike others, can greatly benefit by giving their customers better access to their products.
					The ability to browse and bid online gets people interested and excited in upcoming auctions and
					simply provides better service to customers - plus it exposes the auctions to a ton of new bidders around the world.
					Customers expect businesses to be online, and we're here to bring technology for auctioneers to do just that.

				<h3>Some Key Benefits:</h3>
				
				<p>
					<b>Increased bids and turnout due to the convenience and accessibility of having auctions online.</b>
					<span class="moreinfo">
						Many people find it difficult to make it to auctions due to a wide number of personal and business responsibilities.<br />
						Online access to auctions allow bidders the freedom of easily browsing and bidding in your auctions from virtually anywhere!<br />
						<br />
						Plus the easier and faster a potential bidder can access and view an auction item the more likely that bidder will be to place a bid.<br />
						Online bidding takes down the barriers to accessing your auctions. Potential bidders don't have to wait to place bids,
						they can do so at any time and from almost anywhere.<br />
						<br />
						And when bidders are outbid they are notified and prompted to increase their absentee amount on the spot,
						reducing disappointed bidders and increasing hammer prices.
					</span>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>Increased hammer prices due to more bidders accessing your auctions and bidding online.</b>
					<span class="moreinfo">
						It's simple, the more bidders you have the more bids you'll receive.
						Those bids will push prices up, you'll sell more items and at higher prices.<br />
						<br />
						Not only will people in your auction area have easier access and less barriers to accessing your auctions,
						but a whole world of bidders will now have the ability to access your auctions from wherever they might be!
					</span>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>Live Online Bidding brings your live auctions to computer screens everywhere &amp; anywhere.</b>
					<span class="moreinfo">
						People who can't make it to the auction itself can still participate just as if they were there in person.<br />
						Bidders can sign-on from their computers at their home or office (or airport, vacation, anywhere...) and
						compete live against bidders on the auction floor. Bidders no longer have any excuse not to bid in your auctions!<br />
						<br />
						Now the busiest person can still take a moment to sign-on and bid without disturbing their schedule.<br />
						Even loyal bidders go out of town, with live online bidding they can be in a different country and still make it to your live auction via their laptop!
						There is no need for bidders to be deprived of the interactive live auction experience.<br />
						<br />
						Plus with the optional addition of live real-time audio/video streaming, bidders feel like they are actually at the auction event.
					</span>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>Custom branded websites bring our innovative technology under your name.</b>

						We offer custom websites, with our online auction technology built right in.<br />
						These days people expect businesses to have their products available online, this goes for auctions too.<br />
						With our technology your customers will get the best online experience directly on your website.

				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>Constantly improving technology, without worry.</b>

						Because everything is hosted in the internet "cloud" you never have to install anything, you don't have to worry
						about getting updates or applying new features. Everything is handled for you and included automatically.
					</span>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>Extensive bidder database accumulated over 10+ years of live auctions.</b>
					<span class="moreinfo">
						Not only will your auctions be more accessible to bidders in your area and around the world,
						but we have a large bidder database that is utilized to inform bidders about your auctions.<br />
						With weekly newsletters and auction alerts sent to your past bidders to promote repeat business and customer loyalty.<br />

						Plus our bidder network makes it simple for bidders new to your auctions to start bidding by reducing tedious
						account sign-up and activation procedures while still maintaining a secure approval process controlled and
						customized by you - bringing you top quality bidders and bids.
					</span>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>Personalized support, whenever you need it.</b>
					<span class="moreinfo">
						Our support team will be there for you when you need us, for every auction.<br />
						An on-site technical team can also be made available to help you run your live auction online.
