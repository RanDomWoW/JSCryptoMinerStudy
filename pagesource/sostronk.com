Teams will incomplete rosters will be ignored.\n\n#### Article 2 . Tournament Format.\nTournament format may vary from event to event. Please check the Tournament microsite for the format for that particular Tournament.\n\n#### Article 3 . Match Format\nThis article describes the different match format which will be used. These formats are NOT subject to change and WILL NOT be changed during the tournament.  \n \n*Best-of-one match:* A best-of-one (BO1) match is played in a single game and opposes two teams of five players. A game is played on one map in two halves of 15 in-game rounds each. For each half,  teams play alternatively terrorist and counter-terrorist, and score one point by winning one in-game round. The winner of a match is the first team who reaches a total of 16 in-game rounds. The remaining rounds will not be played after a team has won the match.   \n\nIf the match ends up in a tie, meaning that both teams have won 15 in-game rounds, MR6 overtimes with 10,000 start money will be played until a winner is decided.

Players are advised to be present and ready 20 minutes before the schedule to avoid any unpredictable delay.  \n\n#### Article 5. Setup  \n\nPlayers will be playing on their own setups for the online portion. Players are responsible for their setup being up to date and fully functional, and any delays due to the player setup (power/internet issues) will not be entertained.  \n\nIt is the player’s responsibility to take steps to prevent any DDOS attacks from taking place on themselves.  \n\n#### Article 6.

Teams will incomplete rosters will be ignored.\n\n#### Article 2 . Tournament Format.\nTournament format may vary from event to event. Please check the Tournament microsite for the format for that particular Tournament.\n\n#### Article 3 . Match Format\nThis article describes the different match format which will be used. These formats are NOT subject to change and WILL NOT be changed during the tournament.  \n \n*Best-of-one match:* A best-of-one (BO1) match is played in a single game and opposes two teams of five players. A game is played on one map in two halves of 15 in-game rounds each. For each half,  teams play alternatively terrorist and counter-terrorist, and score one point by winning one in-game round. The winner of a match is the first team who reaches a total of 16 in-game rounds. The remaining rounds will not be played after a team has won the match.   \n\nIf the match ends up in a tie, meaning that both teams have won 15 in-game rounds, MR6 overtimes with 10,000 start money will be played until a winner is decided. For overtime teams do not switch sides at the end of a match. (Overtime rulesets are subject to change depend on the tournament organiser)  \n\n*Best-of-three match*: A best-of-three (BO3) match is played in two or three games and opposes two teams of five players. A game is played on one map in two halves of 15 in-game rounds. For each half, teams play alternatively as terrorist and counter-terrorist, and score one point by winning one in-game round.

Notification    \n\nThe notification indicates the time and the place at which players are requested to be present in order to play their official matches. This notification schedule is described in the tournament schedule and is provided at the beginning of the tournament. Players are advised to be present and ready 20 minutes before the schedule to avoid any unpredictable delay.  \n\n#### Article 5. Setup  \n\nPlayers will be playing on their own setups for the online portion. Players are responsible for their setup being up to date and fully functional, and any delays due to the player setup (power/internet issues) will not be entertained.  \n\nIt is the player’s responsibility to take steps to prevent any DDOS attacks from taking place on themselves.  \n\n#### Article 6. Warm-up  \n\nPlayers get 20 minutes to setup and warm-up after the server is launched. The matches will start at their designated time if players ready up or once the warm-up time ends.

Joining the match  \n\nOnce the Map Veto is done, the server will be launched immediately and the players can click on the join button that appears at the bottom of the Map Veto screen and copy the IP address of the server.  Or alternatively the player will receive a notification on their SoStronk app with the server IP.  \n\nCoaches will not be allowed to join in the server.\n\nPlayers will be in warm-up once they enter the server, once all players ready up by typing .r in the chat, the match will begin with the knife round. After the knife round players have 3 minutes to ready up. The game will go live after 3 minutes irrespective of whether all the players readied up or not.  As mentioned in Article 6, if there are 3 players or lesser in the server after the 20 minutes warm up time ends, that team will be handed a forfeit loss.  \n\nIf any team is having technical difficulties joining the server , the admin must be contacted BEFORE the match time set to go live.  \n\nMatches will be hosted using SoStronk’s own NSA system, if there is any confusion tournament administrators should be contacted for assistance and will be available during creation and starting of all matches.

Teams will incomplete rosters will be ignored.\n\n#### Article 2 . Tournament Format.\nTournament format may vary from event to event. Please check the Tournament microsite for the format for that particular Tournament.\n\n#### Article 3 . Match Format\nThis article describes the different match format which will be used. These formats are NOT subject to change and WILL NOT be changed during the tournament.  \n \n*Best-of-one match:* A best-of-one (BO1) match is played in a single game and opposes two teams of five players. A game is played on one map in two halves of 15 in-game rounds each. For each half,  teams play alternatively terrorist and counter-terrorist, and score one point by winning one in-game round. The winner of a match is the first team who reaches a total of 16 in-game rounds. The remaining rounds will not be played after a team has won the match.   \n\nIf the match ends up in a tie, meaning that both teams have won 15 in-game rounds, MR6 overtimes with 10,000 start money will be played until a winner is decided. For overtime teams do not switch sides at the end of a match. (Overtime rulesets are subject to change depend on the tournament organiser)  \n\n*Best-of-three match*: A best-of-three (BO3) match is played in two or three games and opposes two teams of five players. A game is played on one map in two halves of 15 in-game rounds. For each half, teams play alternatively as terrorist and counter-terrorist, and score one point by winning one in-game round. If one team scores 16 in-game rounds the match ends and the remaining rounds are not to be played. The winner of a match is the team that has won two games.  \n\n\n### Match Procedure\n\n#### Article 4. Notification    \n\nThe notification indicates the time and the place at which players are requested to be present in order to play their official matches. This notification schedule is described in the tournament schedule and is provided at the beginning of the tournament. Players are advised to be present and ready 20 minutes before the schedule to avoid any unpredictable delay.  \n\n#### Article 5. Setup  \n\nPlayers will be playing on their own setups for the online portion. Players are responsible for their setup being up to date and fully functional, and any delays due to the player setup (power/internet issues) will not be entertained.  \n\nIt is the player’s responsibility to take steps to prevent any DDOS attacks from taking place on themselves.  \n\n#### Article 6. Warm-up  \n\nPlayers get 20 minutes to setup and warm-up after the server is launched. The matches will start at their designated time if players ready up or once the warm-up time ends. No additional time will be provided to a team if they are unable to get all 5 members in before the warmup time expires.\n\nIf the team has 4 members in the server the game will go live, but if the team has 3 members or less in the server after 20 minutes and the side with all 5 members in will get the win by default. \nIf both the sides have only 3 players each, then both teams will get default losses, and neither team will move on.   \n\n#### Article 7. Before the match  \n\nBefore the start of a match it is the team captain's responsibility to ensure his team is present on time for the match. Once the tournament goes live, no roster changes will be allowed. Teams will not be able to change the captain for the duration of the tournament.\n  \nThe SoStronk map veto tab on the app will open for Map Veto 20 minutes before the scheduled match time. You can pick or ban by clicking and holding the cursor on the map of your choice. You have 4 minutes for your first pick/ban and 1.5 minute for each remaining pick/ban, and if you do not make a pick/ban in time, the app will randomly pick/ban a map.   \n\nAll matches on SoStronk will follow the following veto rules unless otherwise specified.\n\n**Map selection for a BO1 match**  \n  \nThe SoStronk Map Lobby will randomize which team begins the veto process:\n\n+ Team A will ban a map.  \n+ Team B will ban a map.  \n+ Team A will ban a map \n+ Team B will ban a map  \n+ Team A will ban a map.  \n+ Team B will ban a map.  \n+ The remaining map will be used as the map for the game. Knife rounds will be held for each map. Winner picks which side to start on.  \n\n  \n\n\n**Map selection for a BO3 match**  \n  \nThe SoStronk Map Lobby will randomize which team begins the veto process:\n\n+ Team A will ban a map.  \n+ Team B will ban a map.  \n+ Team A will pick a map. \n+ Team B will pick a map.\n+ Team A will ban a map.  \n+ Team B will ban a map.  \n+ The remaining map will be used as the 3rd map if the series goes three games. Knife rounds will be held for each map. Winner picks which side to start on.  \n\n#### Article 8. Joining the match  \n\nOnce the Map Veto is done, the server will be launched immediately and the players can click on the join button that appears at the bottom of the Map Veto screen and copy the IP address of the server.  Or alternatively the player will receive a notification on their SoStronk app with the server IP.  \n\nCoaches will not be allowed to join in the server.\n\nPlayers will be in warm-up once they enter the server, once all players ready up by typing .r in the chat, the match will begin with the knife round. After the knife round players have 3 minutes to ready up. The game will go live after 3 minutes irrespective of whether all the players readied up or not.  As mentioned in Article 6, if there are 3 players or lesser in the server after the 20 minutes warm up time ends, that team will be handed a forfeit loss.  \n\nIf any team is having technical difficulties joining the server , the admin must be contacted BEFORE the match time set to go live.  \n\nMatches will be hosted using SoStronk’s own NSA system, if there is any confusion tournament administrators should be contacted for assistance and will be available during creation and starting of all matches.  Admins will be available in the SoStronk Discord Channel: https://discord.gg/ABbSyma  \n\n### Game Settings\n\n#### Article 9. Game version\nThe competition will use the latest available version of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. If the lastest version has game-breaking elements, SoStronk will announce the game version the server will be locked to before the matches begin.\n\n#### Article 10. Player settings\nThe following settings are not allowed to be adjusted or used on the players PC:  \n\n+ mat_hdr_enabled 0/1  \n+ mat_hdr_level 0/1/2  \n\nAll other configuration changes are allowed as long as they do not give an unfair edge or advantage comparable to cheating.

This is non-negotiable and if a player repeatedly breaks these rules they will be removed permanently.  \n\nThe guidelines are pretty simple, and can be boiled down to 3 tenets: \n\n- Respect your teammates \u0026 opponents  \n- Take each match seriously  \n- Communicate in a common language  \n\nDue to some players refusing to follow these guidelines, they have been removed from Next. And any players irrespective of how well known they are will be treated the same if they cannot respect these simple rules.  \n\n#### Promotion to Next  \n\nWe had put a hold on Gold Leaderboard players being promoted to Next for the past 2 months, as we found that the majority of the promoted players refused to either follow the guidelines or were just not Next material.  \n\nWhen promoting players, we keep one simple thing in mind: \"Next is for the absolute highest level of CS in Asia.\" As such, when there are players who defeat that purpose action had to be taken. \n\nHaving said that, for the month of March, we will be promoting the _1st placed_ players from both the Indian and the SEA leaderboard for a **2 week** trial period where the Player Council and SoStronk will review their performance and their conduct in Next.  \n\n#### Merging the Next Leaderboard Regions  \n\nThe Next Leaderboard was also split into 2 separate leaderboards: One for India and the other for Rest of Asia. This was initially made in order to motivate both regions with substantial prizes for both regions.  \n\nDue to the shift in number of SEA players playing now compared to Indian players, it made sense for us to combine both the leaderboards into one Asian leaderboard, where there will be _one_ prize pool and everyone competes for it.  \n\nGoing forth, from March 2018 onwards, the Next Leaderboards will be merged into just one.
