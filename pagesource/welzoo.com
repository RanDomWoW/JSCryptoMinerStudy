  “We must become the change we seek.” Gandhi\n\nFriends Across The Line is an educational group that inspires and enables people to lead more peaceful lives by helping them understand the nature and causes of conflict.  We provide people with practical tools to manage disagreement. We counter the mindset that it is acceptable to resolve conflict with violence.  Friends Across The Line is a peace and community building organization built with the goal of supporting, and building friendships, economic justice, and educational activities that may help us cross the line. The line is whatever we perceive as a barrier, a wall, or anything that might keep us at odds.. Our motto is “When All Are Friends, None Are Enemies!!!”\n\nWe hope that Friends Across The Line will serve as a catalyst to produce a positive outcome for adults, teens, and pre-teens regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, political affiliations, size, or anything that may be perceived as a line needing to be crossed.\n\nFatL uses incentive programs, field trips, fun get-togethers, conflict resolution, and our online social network to fight prejudice, bigotry, and racism.\n\nWe are trying to provide positive interactions that allow people to learn through experience that an individual's external appearance does not dictate character, personality, or their significance to the world. Only actions matter.\n\nThrough our F.O.C.U.S. Kids program and partnership we strive to cultivate every child's innate ability to foster peace through cross-cultural experiences and hands-on arts, service, and environmental projects.\nOperation Railroad is a new program of Friends Across The Line, Inc. modeled after the Underground Railroad that helped runaway slaves escape to freedom before the American Civil War. Our version of the Railroad is designed to help members of the LGBT community escape countries that oppress and kill them based on their sexual preference.\n\n \n\nFatL can also provide personal counseling, cultural education, anger management, and gang intervention.\n\nPass events include a FREE to play bowling tournament, a Friendship Fair, lectures, Study Circles,and a food tasting event.\n\nWe are always looking for partner organizations to team up and host other events and activities. Grants, donations, and fundraising ideas are always appreciated.

They seek to create a better future for their families. But the economy in Ukraine is weak, and the future of refugees is uncertain.<p></p><p>&nbsp;We help to improve their situation and reach their goals.Social and psychological support for victims of the conflict is our mission. From our first meeting with refugees and learning the unfortunate hardships they have endured, we help them build new lives.</p><p>Our community helps these people every day, providing shelter, food, medical care, employment and educational opportunities. Currently, our monthly budget is $13,000 -14,000. We aim to build a new settlement for refugee families, to be named “Sweet Home” in the village of Anatevka (near Kiev).</p><p><br>“SweetHome”&nbsp;makes it possible to start anew and to find a place in society. We have a unique understanding of refugees and a plan with solutions. Construction has begun, and we are already being supported by activists and journalists, among them the editors of Forbes magazine.</p><p>At the moment, we have nearly completed the first residences and the school building. Our next goal is furnishing and equipping the school by autumn, so that students may begin learning. For their sake, we are asking for your financial assistance.</p><p>The complete list of current school projects can be found in our photo attachments.</p><h3>Goal</h3><p>Our current goal is to raise

And, nevertheless, I could cook very well since childhood and had taken over all the principles of traditional Jewish cuisine from my grandma, and have been applying them ever since. My grandmother strictly observed the rules and refused to cook, if there was not at least one, albeit a minor ingredient for future meals.

in New York City and the 1.4 million low-income New Yorkers who live in households that can’t afford enough food. The coalition works not only to meet these residents’ immediate food needs but also to enact innovative solutions to help society move “beyond the soup kitchen” to ensure economic and food self-sufficiency for all Americans.\"<br></p><p>For $368, NYCCAH is able to feed an entire family (parents and children) for 365 days. &nbsp;When 1.4 million New Yorkers live in households that can't afford enough food, we need to step in and do our part to help. &nbsp;One family may seem insignificant, but when you really think about it, that's an <i>entire family </i>that needs our help. &nbsp;We have to start somewhere - let's make this project a success so that it will inspire other people to do the same thing we are.</p><ul><li>\"USDA has found that, out of families with children suffering from food insecurity and hunger, 68 percent contained at least one adult working full-time, 10 percent had at least one adult working part-time, 7 percent had an unemployed adult actively looking for work, and 7 percent were headed by an adult with a disability.&nbsp;<strong>The main problem is low wages and few jobs, not laziness.\"</strong></li><li><p>In 2012, 48.9 million Americans, including nearly 15.8 million children, lived in households that couldn’t afford enough food.</p><p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">That means that&nbsp;<strong>one in six Americans – and one in five of the country’s children</strong>&nbsp;– lived in homes that directly face, or lived at the brink of, hunger in 2012.</p></li></ul><h3><br></h3><h3>Goal</h3>\n          <p>The goal is straightforward:

I don't see him every day and I don't always give him money but I like to start off every day with some spare change in my pocket so I can give it to some homeless people throughout my commute to and from work. About a month ago I was feeling pretty sociable and I had nothing to do so I decided to strike a conversation with Phillip.&nbsp;</p><p>He told me about his family out in Chicago and how he came to New York a few months back for a family members funeral and during the funeral he got into an argument with some of his local family members and they kicked him out of the house, forcing him to take to the streets. He talked about how he sleeps on the subway that goes from here to Coney Island. He claims to only need a couple hundred bucks to pay for a bus ticket back home to his daughter and grandson.&nbsp;</p><p><h3>Goal</h3>I believe Phillip, and I hope you can find it in your heart to believe him as well.

With no parental figures around, his \"life lessons\" came\nfrom the multitude of babysitters he had over the years. Christ was his bridge and the old life was washed away.

Within the next couple of months, Jeffrey's goal is to foster stronger virtues within himself that reflect Jesus' character while sharing the Gospel of Christ in Asia, planting churches and doing community projects. This goal is particularly important because change in the world always begins with the change in our minds and us. &nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\n</li>\n\t<li><i>What will Welzoo users help you to do?<br></i><br>\n\n<p>Welzoo users will help him begin a path of personal growth that begins with self-reflection.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24px; background-color: initial;\"><b>Goal</b></span><br>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><p>I want to help him with a goal to raise $200 for his plane ticket to Kansas City, MO where his first three months of the program will be spent.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p><p></p><ul><li><span style=\"font-family: Ubuntu, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; background-color: initial;\">If he does not reach his goal, all funds raised so far will go towards the ticket to subsidize the cost.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p></p><p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Outcome</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Ubuntu, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; background-color: initial; font-weight: normal;\">Jeffrey's specific project will create and foster further social good by giving the basic needs to the people he comes in contact with. When Jeffrey and the team of others from YWAM are in Asia, their goal will be to continue the projects from previous years of building homes for the communities they visit, planting new churches, clothing and feeding those who are needy. They will preach to those who will listen but it will not be the main purpose for creating lasting change within the community. Since he has travelled to Haiti many years ago, Jeffrey is committed to continuing creating social change for the better as he has seen the smiles it has brought to many peoples faces.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Ubuntu, sans-serif;

Getting clean water to these families will allow women and children to contribute to the betterment of their own communities by giving them time to spend on work and education eater than a daily search for water.

He gave his heart to Jesus when he was twelve and has dedicated his voice to spreading the Word.  \n\nWe met and married ten years ago.  In this time, we have been afforded the opportunity to minister in nursing homes, hospitals, the streets-working with the homeless, campgrounds and anywhere else that we are called to serve.  We work as a family in our ministry.  \n\nLarry has always had the dream to record a cd to further the ministry.  Last year for Christmas, our son's Jeremey and his wife Bridget, Jason and Justin purchased studio time for Larry.  We were very excited to put together the songs-however, in January, I was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease.  It has been a challenge to say the least.  Larry has put the cd on hold, putting what ever disposable income we had into my treatment.  This is why we have turned to Welzoo.  I don't want him to loose the studio time that we have-it expires in December.  He won't take the money and use it for the purchase of the song license-he insists on using it for my medication.  So we talked about it.  He said if I could raise the money here, he would use it to make the cd.  If we don't raise the goal of $3500.00 to make the cd with 10 songs, we will use what ever is raised to make a cd with the amount of songs that we do have the money for.\n\nIf you wish to listen and see for yourself, please go to cly15229 on youtube.

My name is Saudia Sade (most people just call me Sade) and I a 27 year old creative living in Atlanta, GA. I have spent the entirely of my career focused on creating amazing things for all of my clients, friends and family. Just recently have I had to urge to pursue and live all of my own personal dreams. My attitude toward life has changed tremendously because of that.</p><p><strong>SO WHAT ARE YOUR DREAMS?</strong></p><p>Right now I have one dream that has two parts, I want to create a forum where I can share all of my creativity, not just my design. I have a love for food, decor and fashion … what better way to share than then through imagery and blogging? I have dreamt of having a blog for a while now where I could record my design tips, DIY projects, recipes and pretty much all the things that are zooming around my mind on a daily basis. I have watch so many people become successful through blogging and I know that I will be the next extreme success story. Part two of that dream is to take it one step further and not only blog creatively but share videos and create a youtube channel where anyone can go and find inspiration, motivation or just a laugh.</p><p>I have already taken months to perfect my concept, what content I will be sharing and coming up with the perfect structure for staying motivated to make this a business for myself. A few of the things I want to provide along with the blog and channel are:</p><ol><li>Downloadable Prints</li><li>Digital Courses</li><li>Downloadable Design Tips</li><li>A Book on Creative Evolution</li><li>Merchandise</li><li>Freebies &amp; Contest</li></ol><p><b>SO WHAT IS HOLDING YOU BACK?</b></p><p>Well right now the only thing that is honestly holding me back is not having the equipment and software to create the kind of high quality content that I would be proud of sharing. I have been using the same white macbook since 2007 and it is on its last leg and running out of space. My design programs are out of date and I don’t have a digital camera / slr to create the proper videos and images that I need to make this blog a reality. I also need to create a space (home office) where I can craft, record and edit effectively.</p><p>With the reality of life all of my income is going to making sure I have a roof over my head and food in my mouth. So I am putting myself out there and asking for genuine help to create something that I feel would be beneficial to the internet community.</p><p><p><strong>HOW DO WE KNOW WHERE OUR MONEY IS GOING?</strong></p><p>I will post a blog after this one with a detailed break down of everything that I will be purchasing with the funds that are raised. I will also be posting blogs with progress updates, unboxing videos and room tours. I want to share this experience with my viewers, readers and anyone who participates.</p><p>Some of the funds will also be going to the perks that will be sent to each person that donates to my campaign. I have decided to do a self hosted campaign so that I can maximize the use of the funds and make sure that everything that I send out is top quality.</p></p><p></p>\n          <h3>What do I need?</h3>\n          <p></p><p><strong>MACBOOK PRO 15″</strong></p><ul><li>2.8GHz Quad-core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 4.0GHz</li><li>16GB 1600MHz DDR3L SDRAM</li><li>1TB PCIe-based Flash Storage</li><li>Intel Iris Pro Graphics and NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M with 2GB of GDDR5 memory</li><li>Apple Thunderbolt Display (27-inch)</li><li>Backlit Keyboard (English) &amp; User’s Guide</li><li>Final Cut Pro X</li><li>Aperture</li><li>AppleCare Protection Plan for MacBook Pro – Auto-enroll</li><li>One to One membership — 1 year</li></ul><div><p><strong>Nikon – D7100 DSLR Camera with 18-140mm and 55-300mm VR Lens Kit – Black</strong></p><ul><li>Nikon D7100 DSLR Camera</li><li>18-140mm and 55-300mm VR lenses</li><li>Rechargeable battery (EN-EL15), charger</li><li>USB and A/V cables, 32GB Secure Digital memory card, strap, bag, body and lens caps, wireless mobile adapter, NikonView NX2, Better Pictures in 5 Minutes DVD</li><li>Owner’s manual</li></ul><p>The&nbsp;<b>Stellar Lighting Systems CEL-R18C 18″ Fluorescent Ring Light with Dimmer</b>&nbsp;is a lightweight, portable beauty light that renders soft shadowless light.

I know that may seem like a short amount of time but I know that it can be done and I am so ready to start creating and sharing content with you guys. Please share this campaign with your friends and followers and help me reach my goal. I am so appreciative for all the verbal support that I have gotten thus far. I am so motivated to create something that is going to put a positive light on creativity and design.</p><p>I have so much to share and to say about so many things and I want to document my creative journey, share tips on how to be successful on social media, monetizing blogs and videos, and so much more. This is more than just a blog or youtube channel that I am trying to create, it will be a study on what to do and what not to do when trying to break out into this digital world. I will share every success and every failure.</p><p>I have mapped out a schedule of sharing content for you guys as well so you know what to expect when everything is up and running.

My purpose in creating this website and youtube channel is to give back, to give all of my readers and subscribers a glimpse into my creative process and my life.","websites":["","www.saudiasade.com","www.artedealher.com","www.instagram.com/saudiasade","www.twitter.com/saudiasade"]},"amount_raised_in_cents":0,"recent_supporters":[{"id":1558,"name":"Maalik Walker","picture_url":false},{"id":1556,"name":"Saudia Sade Furcron","picture_url":"http://graph.facebook.com/92300309/picture?type=large"}],"supporters":0,"days_left":-1195,"days_active":1316,"score":56,"score_needed":67,"progress_percentage":0.0,"view_count":90,"current_level":{"color":"#f64246","created_at":"2014-09-11T19:17:46-04:00","id":2,"name":"-","number":2,"updated_at":"2014-09-13T11:00:29-04:00","value":2},"previous_level":{"color":"#42acf6","created_at":"2014-09-11T19:11:39-04:00","id":1,"name":"-","number":1,"updated_at":"2014-09-13T11:00:22-04:00","value":1},"next_level":{"color":"#b842f6","created_at":"2014-09-11T19:18:07-04:00","id":3,"name":"-","number":3,"updated_at":"2014-09-13T11:00:34-04:00","value":3}},{"id":17,"approved":true,"active":true,"title":"Guatemala Volunteer ","description":"<h3>Summary</h3>\n          <p>I am 21 years old and have had a heart for missions work for many years. I grew up as an adopted child and beforehand suffered many trials. On my bucket list, since I was thirteen; I often said I would like to make a difference in at least two people's lives and change at least one person's world. I have learned from Gandhi you must be the change in the world YOU want to see.&nbsp;</p>\n          <h3>Goal</h3>\n          <p>My goal is to raise as much money as I can in order to be able to survive four months in Guatemala. The registration fee alone is 249 dollars and the rest is is 1600 due to the fact that for three months I will be housed and fed! No matter what all the funds will be sent to International Volunteer Headquarters for the trip!&nbsp;</p><ul>\n          </ul>\n          <h3>Outcome</h3>\n          <p></p>\n          <p>My project will help many people's lives. In Guatemala dogs and cats are not treated as part of the family, therefore leaving many with neglect and abuse. I will be giving love, changing cages, feeding and bathing all kinds of animals. In the orphanage, I will be helping children do simple activities, teaching, and spending quality time with them. In the turtle conservation project I will be releasing Hatching's into the wild as well as protecting the eggs and building new areas to house them. I have had much experience with these types of projects as I worked through Plumstead Christian School in the Dominican Republic and also in Mexico with Washington's Crossing United Methodist church.&nbsp;</p>","short_description":"I will be traveling to Guatemala in November for four months working with Animal Rights, Turtle Conservation, and within the orphanage!

Flourishing","description":"<h3></h3>One of my passions as visual artist is how art can help create a better world. One of my biggest concerns right now is the dwindling numbers of honeybees. This project came into being as a meeting place of these two ideas. This project involves art, science and service, and a genuine affection for honeybees. As we have been hearing more about what has been happening to honeybees worldwide, I have wondered what I could do to help. Perhaps you have been asking that same question. In my research, I discovered some easy ways to help, and that we each can have a part to play in bringing the bees back. As you know, every little bit counts.&nbsp; <br><br>The project will consist of an art exhibition of paintings and drawings that educate and bring awareness to ways to support restoring the honeybee population, as well as the behaviors, habitat, and nature of these remarkable creatures. The exhibition will be at the North Portland Public Library in Portland, Oregon in September 2015, with the possibility of traveling to other venues around the United States. Along with an exhibition printed and digital informational materials will be offered about how to help bees thrive in our communities. <br><br>This is so exciting to share you should hear it right now: Welzoo has named this project as a winner, so they will fund the remaining 50% of the project once the funding on this site gets to 50%. That means all funds are worth twice as much to make this project happen!<br><br>A little about my work history: I have been exhibiting my art for over ten years. My paintings have been featured in solo and group exhibitions in museums and galleries nationally and internationally, including New York, Chicago, New Orleans, Dallas, and London. My work is in private and corporate collections throughout the world. <br><br>So, for this project, funds are needed to purchase the oil paints, panels, paper, frames, and drawing materials (including beeswax as a drawing medium!) for nine paintings and thirteen drawings. In addition the funding will make it possible to print materials for exhibition attendees about specific ways to help restore honeybee numbers. The budget for this project will make this awareness-raising, solution-oriented project happen. It’s exciting to be bringing this project into being, to see what art can make possible. Partial funding could stop the project from happening, or not allow information about action steps to get into people’s hands. To me, the action is the most important part. The art is meant to inspire these small actions that can really make a difference.<br><br>It would be good to tell you that I have been exhibiting my work steadily for over ten years, as well as curated exhibitions in the Portland area. I have received three grants for the Regional Arts and Culture Council in Portland, so I have experience working on projects with a budget. <br><br>And another thing that you should know is that 20% of any sales of my work from this exhibition will be given to a non-profit that provides honeybees to families in need throughout the world (along with training and supplies to take care of them). <br><br>The intention for the project is to bring more awareness to art as a way to create solutions. Most people are aware that honeybees have been in trouble for some time. This project will focus what we can do to help these pollinators. Why should we give attention to helping bees thrive? Here is a quote that has been attributed to Albert Einstein, Maurice Maeterlinck, and Charles Darwin that answers this question perfectly:<br><br>\"If the bee disappeared off the surface of the&nbsp;globe,&nbsp;then man would have only four years of life left.&nbsp;No more bees,&nbsp;no more pollination, no more&nbsp;plants, no more animals, no more man.”<br><br>My hope is that we will all be around for a while. Perhaps, you are also partial being around for a while, and to living in a vibrant flourishing world.<br><br>The video is of Louie Schwartzberg's TED talk from 2011; &nbsp;Louie Schwartzberg is a renowned cinematographer. He eloquently speaks of how important pollinators are, and his work is beautiful. The video is included here so that you can see one of the main catalysts for this project. <br><br>Thanks for reading!<br><br><p></p>","short_description":"Art Exhibition and printed materials focusing on how to help bees thrive in our communities, and discover how remarkable these creatures are","photo":{"created_at":"2014-08-12T20:00:20-04:00","id":1079,"image":{"url":"https://382554dfb1737e6a2b4f-6c5eed67bbefb861cd723aba936a3f2f.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/uploads/image/b7292665-9c8e-4fbc-bc08-a9a52640e8f9.jpg","logo_upload":{"url":"https://382554dfb1737e6a2b4f-6c5eed67bbefb861cd723aba936a3f2f.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/uploads/image/logo_upload_b7292665-9c8e-4fbc-bc08-a9a52640e8f9.jpg"},"logo_charity_list":{"url":"https://382554dfb1737e6a2b4f-6c5eed67bbefb861cd723aba936a3f2f.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/uploads/image/logo_charity_list_b7292665-9c8e-4fbc-bc08-a9a52640e8f9.jpg"},"logo_toolbar_small":{"url":"https://382554dfb1737e6a2b4f-6c5eed67bbefb861cd723aba936a3f2f.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/uploads/image/logo_toolbar_small_b7292665-9c8e-4fbc-bc08-a9a52640e8f9.jpg"},"logo_project_large":{"url":"https://382554dfb1737e6a2b4f-6c5eed67bbefb861cd723aba936a3f2f.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/uploads/image/logo_project_large_b7292665-9c8e-4fbc-bc08-a9a52640e8f9.jpg"},"logo_signup":{"url":"https://382554dfb1737e6a2b4f-6c5eed67bbefb861cd723aba936a3f2f.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/uploads/image/logo_signup_b7292665-9c8e-4fbc-bc08-a9a52640e8f9.jpg"},"photo_size_1":{"url":"https://382554dfb1737e6a2b4f-6c5eed67bbefb861cd723aba936a3f2f.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/uploads/image/photo_size_1_b7292665-9c8e-4fbc-bc08-a9a52640e8f9.jpg"},"photo_size_2":{"url":"https://382554dfb1737e6a2b4f-6c5eed67bbefb861cd723aba936a3f2f.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/uploads/image/photo_size_2_b7292665-9c8e-4fbc-bc08-a9a52640e8f9.jpg"},"photo_size_3":{"url":"https://382554dfb1737e6a2b4f-6c5eed67bbefb861cd723aba936a3f2f.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/uploads/image/photo_size_3_b7292665-9c8e-4fbc-bc08-a9a52640e8f9.jpg"},"profile_picture_small":{"url":"https://382554dfb1737e6a2b4f-6c5eed67bbefb861cd723aba936a3f2f.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/uploads/image/profile_picture_small_b7292665-9c8e-4fbc-bc08-a9a52640e8f9.jpg"},"profile_picture_medium":{"url":"https://382554dfb1737e6a2b4f-6c5eed67bbefb861cd723aba936a3f2f.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/uploads/image/profile_picture_medium_b7292665-9c8e-4fbc-bc08-a9a52640e8f9.jpg"},"profile_picture_project_large":{"url":"https://382554dfb1737e6a2b4f-6c5eed67bbefb861cd723aba936a3f2f.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/uploads/image/profile_picture_project_large_b7292665-9c8e-4fbc-bc08-a9a52640e8f9.jpg"},"team_member":{"url":"https://382554dfb1737e6a2b4f-6c5eed67bbefb861cd723aba936a3f2f.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/uploads/image/team_member_b7292665-9c8e-4fbc-bc08-a9a52640e8f9.jpg"},"goal_photo":{"url":"https://382554dfb1737e6a2b4f-6c5eed67bbefb861cd723aba936a3f2f.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/uploads/image/goal_photo_b7292665-9c8e-4fbc-bc08-a9a52640e8f9.jpg"},"project_photo":{"url":"https://382554dfb1737e6a2b4f-6c5eed67bbefb861cd723aba936a3f2f.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/uploads/image/project_photo_b7292665-9c8e-4fbc-bc08-a9a52640e8f9.jpg"},"project_photo_small":{"url":"https://382554dfb1737e6a2b4f-6c5eed67bbefb861cd723aba936a3f2f.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/uploads/image/project_photo_small_b7292665-9c8e-4fbc-bc08-a9a52640e8f9.jpg"},"project_photo_large":{"url":"https://382554dfb1737e6a2b4f-6c5eed67bbefb861cd723aba936a3f2f.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/uploads/image/project_photo_large_b7292665-9c8e-4fbc-bc08-a9a52640e8f9.jpg"},"project_post_medium":{"url":"https://382554dfb1737e6a2b4f-6c5eed67bbefb861cd723aba936a3f2f.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/uploads/image/project_post_medium_b7292665-9c8e-4fbc-bc08-a9a52640e8f9.jpg"},"celebrity_picture_large":{"url":"https://382554dfb1737e6a2b4f-6c5eed67bbefb861cd723aba936a3f2f.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/uploads/image/celebrity_picture_large_b7292665-9c8e-4fbc-bc08-a9a52640e8f9.jpg"}},"images_id":14,"images_type":"Project","updated_at":"2014-08-12T20:29:03-04:00","upload_type":"project_photo"},"photo_id":1079,"video_link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqsXc_aefKI","video_provider":"YouTube","video_id":"eqsXc_aefKI","goal_amount":3000,"days":120,"url":"/projects/14/bee-flourishing","pending_changes":null,"original_project_id":null,"original_project_url":null,"user_id":1548,"furthest_step":"launch","submitted":true,"cents_per_view":3,"category_id":2,"User":{"name":"Tamara English","location":"Portland, Oregon USA","profile_picture_project_large":"https://382554dfb1737e6a2b4f-6c5eed67bbefb861cd723aba936a3f2f.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/uploads/image/profile_picture_project_large_1a3c7f33-783a-4c18-ba70-4485be8f2abe.jpg","email":"tamara@tamaraenglish.com","bio":"As a visual artist I have a passion for making the world a better place, in big and small ways.

In this time of The Great Turning, we all have a part to play. The ways that we support what each other does are a valuable part of making the best possible future, for each of us and for more than ourselves.\n\nThe central concern of my recent work is the personal experience of divine presence, beyond religion or dogma.

WE ARE/OUR MISSION \nFounded in 1919, Anixter Center is one of the largest nonprofits in Chicago to serve people with disabilities.\nAnixter Center’s mission is to provide an array of services and supports to help people with disabilities and related challenges to live, learn, work, and play in the community. \n\nWHO WE SERVE\nThrough 35 programs at 36 locations across greater Chicago, the agency serves nearly 8,000 children, teens, adults, and seniors with disabilities annually. 90% of our clients are low-income (many are living at 200% below the federal poverty level).\n\nOUR DIVISIONS\nAnixter Center has 3 divisions:\nCALOR- which provides HIV/AIDS prevention, outreach, and educational services to Chicago’s underserved Latino community and all people of color.\nCHICAGO HEARING SOCIETY (CHS)-which provides an array of programs and services for children, teens, and adults who are deaf or hard of hearing;\n NATIONAL LEKOTEK CENTER (LEKOTEK)-Which provides family-based programming utilizing toys and play to help young children (0-8) with special needs reach developmental milestones;\n\nWHAT MAKES US UNIQUE\nMost similar agencies cater to a specific age or type of disability. Not Anixter Center! We offer a broad spectrum of services/programs that can support people ages 0 to100+ with any type of disability.\n\nOUR PROGRAMS\nOur programs focus on 5 key issue areas that impact all of us: Employment, Education, Housing, Healthcare, and Community Support.
