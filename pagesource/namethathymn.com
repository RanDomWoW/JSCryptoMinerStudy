    Welcome to Name That Hymn</div>
    </h1>
      <p>This 
        site began as a site reaching out to the Internet community to help me 
        find &quot;lost&quot; hymn lyrics for a hymnal I was editing.</p>
      <p>But 
        something interesting happened. After I launched the site, I noticed that 
        people started to write in, asking for help locating hymn lyrics that 
        <em>they</em> were searching for. In many cases, the hymn lyrics they 
        were seeking were to a song that was very near and dear to their or a 
        loved one's heart. In many cases, I was able to help track down the hymns. 
        Needless to say, it was a very rewarding experience. </p>
      <p>So, 
        I thought I might convert this site as one devoted to <b>anyone</b> who 
        might be searching for hymns and hymn lyrics. Here are the sections of 
        the site:</p>
      <p class="style5 style6"> <strong><a href="http://www.namethathymn.com/hymn-lyrics-detective-forum">Hymn 
        Lyrics Search Forum</a></strong> </p>
      <p>Searching 
        for a hymn? Post your request in the <a href="http://www.namethathymn.com/hymn-lyrics-detective-forum">Hymn 
        Lyrics Search Forum</a>. I'll try my best to respond to your request, 
        and if I can't, hopefully a fellow traveler on the Information Superhighway 
        can. </p>
      <p>Include 
        in your request as much information as you know of the hymn -- any lyrics 
        you remember (even sporadic words or phrases), the melody, a possible 
        title, where and when you remember singing it, etc. The more clues you 
        provide, the better the chances of someone finding it. </p>
      <p class="style6"><span class="style8"><a href="http://www.namethathymn.com/hymn-lyrics-search-engine.html"><strong>The Name That Hymn Search Engine</strong></a></span></p>
      <p>You can start your search here. This is a search engine for this site, built on top of Google technology, that searches for your lyrics on some of the more popular hymn lyrics sites on the Internet. </p>
      <p><a href="/christian-hymns/"><strong>Classic Christian Hymns</strong></a></p>
      <p>This is a section of the site dedicated to providing lyrics, sheet music, audio files, guitar chords, hymn stories, scripture references, videos, and references to classic Christian hymns that have stood the test of time. </p>
      <p><strong><a href="http://www.namethathymn.com/favorite-hymn-downloads.html">Favorite Hymns</a></strong><br>
        <br>
        This is the list of the 25 hymns and praise songs that are most often 
        searched for on this site. Links are provided to the discussion forum, 
        where you can read the discussion on each song. There's also a link to 
      download the song from iTunes.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="http://www.namethathymn.com/blog">Hymn Blog</a></strong><br />
          <br />
        This is a blog of devotionals that were inspired by favorite hymns. Each 
        contains a PDF and MIDI file of the hymn. I hope these are a blessing 
        to someone out there. (For the time being, this is updated very sporadically 
      :))</p>
      <p class="style6"><a href="http://www.namethathymn.com/hymn-lyrics-search-tips.html">Tips 
      on Searching for Hymns</a></p>
      <p>Over 
        the years, I've found many helpful hints and tips to help in hymn searches. 
        This is a list of &quot;secrets&quot; I've found over the years that may 
        help you in your search, as well as links to sites I've found particularly 
        helpful. </p>

      Original Name That Hymn Site</a></span></p>
      <p>These 
        was the original site I put up requesting assistance for my own hymnal 
        project. If there are experts out there in Gospel hymns that may have 
        circulated in Asia in the early-to-mid 20th century, I could still use 
        your help with the original search!</p>
