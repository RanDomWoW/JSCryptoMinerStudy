By clicking on the "Read and Agree" button in the section of Lending Transaction Agreement (hereinafter referred to as "this Agreement") on this Website, you indicate that you have fully accepted the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p><p>2. Your lending transactions on this Website are voluntary transaction conducted by you at your discretion on the basis of your own financial situation and a thorough understanding of the relevant risks, and do not implicate this Website or any third person in any manner whatsoever.</p><p>3. If you engage in lending transactions on this Website, you may receive significant return on your investment, and may also be subject to considerable investment risks. In order to help you better understand the risks, you are hereby warned against the risks associated with lending transactions, in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, administrative ordinances and relevant state policies, and please read the following risk warning carefully. Your lending transaction on this Website include but are not limited to:</p><p>(1) Inherent risks of digital assets: the digital assets market is new and unconfirmed, and does not necessarily grow. At present, digital assets are mainly used by speculators in large quantities, and are used less on retail and commercial markets; therefore, the price of digital assets is volatile, and thus may have a negative impact on investments in digital assets. In addition, different from the stock market, the digital assets market does not have a "limit up-limit down" mechanism, and is open for trading around the clock. As bargaining chips of digital assets are relatively fewer, the price of digital assets may be subject to major fluctuations caused by market-makers’ control and global government policies, and may even rise or drop by several times within one day. In view of this, any and all financial losses attributable to the digital assets themselves shall be borne solely by you.<br><br>(2) Policy risks: trading in digital assets may be suspended or prohibited at any time due to the adoption or modification of any applicable law, regulation and regulatory document in relevant countries. Any and all financial losses that may arise when trading in digital assets is suspended or prohibited due to the adoption or modification of any law, administrative regulation or regulatory document in a relevant country shall be borne by you exclusively.<br><br>(3) Risks relating to the Internet and technology: this Website cannot guarantee that all the information, programs, texts, etc. contained in this Website are completely safe, and free from the interference and destruction by any malicious programs, such as viruses, Trojans, etc.; therefore, your log onto this Website, your use of any service offered by this Website, or download of any program, information, data, etc. of this Website, and your use of such downloaded program, information, data, etc, are your personal decisions and therefore you shall exclusively bear all possible risks and losses that may arise due to such decisions.

As this Website cannot control the reliability and availability of the Internet, this Website will not be held liable for any distortion, delay and access failure in any way whatsoever.<br><br>(4) Risks relating to force majeure: where this Website is unable to provide the Service or has to delay the Service due to information network equipment maintenance, information network connection failures, errors in computers, communication systems or other systems, power failures, attacks, the weather, accidents, strikes, labour disputes, violent upheavals, uprisings, riots, lack of productivity or production materials, fires, floods, storms, explosions, wars, reasons on the part of banks or any other partners, the collapse of the digital assets market, government actions, orders of judicial or administrative authorities, other acts that are beyond the control by this Website, or over which this Website does not have the ability to control, or any reasons on the part of any third party, and therefore causes damages to you, this Website shall not be held liable in any way whatsoever.<br><br>(5) Market risks. This Website does not guarantee the correctness or applicability of relevant trading analyses, market analyses, etc.; this Website cannot control the information or advice that you have received or will receive from the intermediaries or any other agency or employee thereof, nor does this Website support or guarantee the accuracy or integrity of such information or advice in connection with trading; all the risks that may arise due to such analyses, information, advice shall be borne exclusively by you, without implicating this Website in any manner whatsoever.<br><br>(6) Risks relating to seizure and freezing. Where a competent authority, by presenting relevant investigation warrants, requires this Website to cooperate with any investigation into your account with this Website, or seal up, freeze or transfer of such account, this Website will provide necessary assistance to such authority by providing to it your corresponding data in accordance with the requirements of such authority, or by carrying out the corresponding operations; in this case, this Website shall not be held liable for any disclosure of your privacy, the inoperability of your account, or losses, etc., that may arise consequently.<br><br>(7) Other risks: risks that you may sustain damages because you lose your account, forget the password to your account, engage in any improper operation or make any mistake in investment decision-making; losses that may arise due to any malicious operation by any other party that you may entrust online; losses that may arise if you entrust any other person to engage in lending transactions on this Website on your behalf; losses that are caused by other unexpected events or factors that are not attributable to this Website. All of the above losses will be borne by you exclusively.<br><br>(8) Special reminder: if you participate in the lending transactions on this Website, you shall properly control the risks, assess the value and risks of investment in digital assets at your own discretion, and bear the financial risk that all your investment may be lost; you shall base your transaction on your own financial conditions and risk-bearing capacity, and clearly recognize the risks of digital assets investment. If you invest in digital assets, there is the possibility that you may obtain profits, as well as the possibility that you may sustain losses. Risk warning in this Agreement does not disclose all risks relating to lending transactions in connection with digital assets. You are advised to have a clear understanding of this fact and be aware that the market is subject to risks and therefore prudent investment is recommended.</p><p>4. Lending transactions involve significant risks.

The daily service fee shall be the amount of credit that you apply for multiplied by the daily rate of service fee.</p><p>8. In order to ensure financial security, if any part of the credit that you apply for is not repaid, then the amount of assets that you can cash in on this Website shall be the balance between your total assets minus two times of the amount that you borrow (including service fee).</p><p>9.
