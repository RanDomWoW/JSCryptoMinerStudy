<br><br>
This shouldn’t really catch anybody by surprise, considering the base game <a href='http://steamspy.com/app/321960' target='_blank'>lackluster sale numbers</a>, or the absolute non-existent promotion of the Trial by Fire expansion, which as of today has still not been <a href='http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/might-and-magic-heroes-vii---trial-by-fire' target='_blank'>reviewed</a> either. <b>H7 woes have been in the talk of the community since before the game started the public beta, with each of Ubisoft’s movements spilling more doubts around its eventual fate</b>. Although it is remarkable that the support of the game has been terminated after only two months of its release, a sad record in the franchise.
<br><br>
It is hard to imagine where will the Might & Magic franchise will go from here. <b>After the disaster of H6, H7 was supposed to bring some form of stability to the series, but it has obviously failed</b>. With the spin-offs released after H6 (DoC, HO, MMX) also failing to leave a mark and all but forgotten now, plus Limbic out of the picture, it would not surprise me if the M&M brand is <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia#Future' target='_blank'>frozen</a> until the time for a proper comeback is due. Or it could continue releasing cheap mobile games on the chinese market, who knows.
<br><br>
On an unrelated note, our veteran moderator in the Tournament of Honor forums, <b>Vesuvius</b>, has been working on a turn-based strategy game for the past two years called <a href='http://www.spacewars.com/' target='_blank'>Space Wars</a>. Game beta will start on December, and he has already posted some information about the game. If you are interested or you have any questions about the game, <a href='http://heroescommunity.com/viewthread.php3?TID=42782' target='_top'>drop by</a> and ask him directly, he won't bite! :)</p><hr size=1 width=600><br><a name='2'><p><span class='small'>Posted by <a href='team.shtml' target='_top'>Storm-Giant</a> at 19:58, 6 Aug 2016:</span><br><span class='big'>Troubled Heroes VII Expansion Release</span><br><br>A lot has happened since I last updated here. <b>Trial by Fire</b>, the Heroes VII expansion focused on the Dwarf faction, has finally been released, 2 months after it was <a href='https://mmh7.ubi.com/en/blog/post/view/trial-by-fire-new-release-date' target='_blank'>delayed</a> for no real reason. That was soon followed by a period of little-to-no promotion from Ubisoft, just releasing little tidbits of the Fortress faction on the official page. Some fans hoped more information would be given through the pre-release <a href='https://steamcommunity.com/app/321960/discussions/0/358415738216204096/' target='_blank'>Twitch session</a> announced over one month before it would take place, but that was not meant to be.
<br><br>
This very Monday, <i>just mere hours</i> before the stream would go live, it was <a href='https://steamcommunity.com/app/321960/discussions/0/358415738216204096/#c360670708794690309' target='_blank'>cancelled</a>. <b>Again, no reason was given about it, leaving fans of the series puzzled and outraged</b>. In a not-so funny twist, the Ubisoft Community Manager encouraged the fans to buy the expansion...which could not be bought at the time! Indeed, <b>the expansion price was only announced the very same day it was released ($39,99 or €29,99, depends of the country)</b>. To make things even worse, the game wasn’t available on their own platform (Uplay) until the next day...
<br><br>
It would seem as if even Ubisoft has given up on the franchise. There is absolutely no buzz going around the expansion. Aside from the <a href='https://mmh7.ubi.com/en/blog/post/view/might-magic-heroes-vii-trial-by-fire-now-available' target='_blank'>release note</a> in the official page, there is nothing to be seen. <b><a href='http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/might-and-magic-heroes-vii---trial-by-fire' target='_blank'>The metacritic page</a> is currently empty and a quick google search brought no results either</b>. If you are wondering about the state of this expansion and what it offers, I would recommend to check out our <a href='http://heroescommunity.com/viewthread.php3?TID=42709&PID=1383526#focus' target='_top'>dedicated thread</a> in our forums, where a few fellow members are posting their impressions. It’s better than nothing, I presume!

Regardless, the expansion will also bring forward <b>gameplay changes</b>, as well as a bunch of <b>new skirmish maps and two original story scenarios written by Terry B. Ray</b>, Heroes IV's acclaimed writer.
<br><br>
The expansion will be standalone, meaning the base game is not required to play it, and <b>it will be available on June 2nd</b>, on Uplay and <a href='http://store.steampowered.com/app/445310/' target='_blank'>Steam</a>. Do not hesitate to share your thoughts on this on our <a href='http://heroescommunity.com/forumdisplay.php3?FID=21' target='_top'>forum</a>.</p><hr size=1 width=600><br><a name='4'><p><span class='small'>Posted by <a href='team.shtml' target='_top'>Storm-Giant</a> at 00:22, 17 Apr 2016:</span><br><span class='big'>Global Alternative Creatures MOD for H7 after 1.8 Patch!</span><br><br>After two months of no news on the Heroes VII front - <i>quite <a href='https://mmh7.ubi.com/en/blog' target='_blank'>literally</a></i> - this week has seen the release of two independent updates: the 1.8 patch, accompanied by the second half of the Lost Tales campaigns, and a fan-made MOD adding alternative creatures to all factions.
<br><br>
Sadly, the <a href='https://mmh7.ubi.com/en/blog/post/view/patch-1-8-notes' target='_blank'>1.8 patch</a> is rather underwhelming, bringing minor fixes and AI changes to the game, <b>with the use of the Wait command by the AI as the highlight</b>...On the other hand, the second half of the Lost Tales of Axeon: <a href='https://mmh7.ubi.com/en/blog/post/view/the-lost-tales-of-axeoth-every-dog-has-his-day-now-available' target='_blank'>Every Dog has his Day</a> should prove to be another high-quality story. Finally, changes to the skill system are said to be released in a <a href='http://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/1426568-MMH7-future-Q-amp-A?s=f69a0420be3b40f3ba9cc42e9fe4c8a2&p=11567986&viewfull=1#post11567986' target='_blank'>future update</a>, but no details have been given as of yet.
<br><br>
Hot from <a href='http://www.acidcave.net/' target='_blank'>Acid Cave</a> comes the first significant MOD created by the fans. <b>The <a href='http://www.heroes7.acidcave.net/ac_mod_eng.html' target='_blank'>AC Mod</a></b> is, in their own words <i>an unofficial and global (map independent) gameplay mod for Heroes VII. Its goal is to align each faction with two more alternative creatures, which until now were neutral, and allow them to be recruitable in towns</i>. I applaud this effort from the community,  as it should give the remaining fans interested in the game something to enjoy while playing it.

Be on the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmzlgtJPx6Q&ab_channel=HOMMChannel' target='_blank'>Adventure map</a>, the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNxUvXmqroQ&ab_channel=Banzay27' target='_blank'>combat zone</a> or the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFcjgdby7F4&ab_channel=stormage09' target='_blank'>Townscreens</a>, we have grown accustomed to these unforgettable, catchy tunes; ranging from the opera tunes of Heroes II to the epic themes of Heroes III and IV, adding an element of immersion to the game that it would hard to imagine a Heroes without them.
<br><br>
And the man behind them was no other than <a href='https://soundcloud.com/paul-anthony-romero/' target='_blank'>Paul Anthony Romero</a>, who is now launching a <a href='https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/indiedesigners/paul-anthony-romero-the-piano-sonatas-album' target='_blank'>Kickstarter</a> to release the first Heroes of Might and Magic piano sonata album & scorebook. <b>The project has an ambitious $30.000 goal, with 20 days left to achieve it</b>. Backers who pledge $5 or more will receive a digital copy of the album, while investing over $14 guarantees a physical copy of it. A Polish team of fans will take care of the technical aspects of the project.</p><hr size=1 width=600><br><a name='6'><p><span class='small'>Posted by <a href='team.shtml' target='_top'>Storm-Giant</a> at 00:10, 19 Feb 2016:</span><br><span class='big'>Heroes 5.5 RC6, Heroes VII patch 1.7 are out!</span><br><br>A new update of <b><a href='http://heroescommunity.com/member.php3?action=viewprofile&UserName=magnomagus' target='_top'>magnomagus</a></b>'s acclaimed MOD has been published this month. <a href='http://heroescommunity.com/viewthread.php3?TID=41303&PID=1351862#focus' target='_top'>Release Candidate 6</a> brings major improvements to the balance of the game between might and magic hero classes. Some of the changes include mass spells ATB usage, War Machines power and <b>balanced alternative upgrades</b>. The later stands out as these adjustments are <b>backed up by math</b> in the pursuit of offering viable creature choices instead of no-brainer ones as it was the case in many of them in the original Tribes of the East release.
<br><br>
An special shoutout goes to <b><a href='http://heroescommunity.com/member.php3?action=viewprofile&UserName=Deflaktor' target='_top'>Deflaktor</a></b>, as it is thanks to <a href='http://heroescommunity.com/viewthread.php3?TID=41404' target='_top'>his work</a> in reverse engineering of the game some of this changes are possible. It should not come as a surprise that the two most highly valued installments of the series, H3 and H5, have experienced very active mapmaking and modding communities even 16/10 years after their official release. <b>There are fans who aren’t happy with the standards of the latest official releases and seek quality Heroes gameplay through other routes</b>.
<br><br>
Speaking of which, after being <a href='https://mmh7.ubi.com/en/blog/post/view/the-lost-tales-of-axeoth-unity-available-february-2016' target='_blank'>delayed</a> <a href='http://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/1388183-Patch-1-7-delay' target='_blank'>twice</a>, H7 patch 1.7 has finally been <a href='https://mmh7.ubi.com/en/blog/post/view/patch-1-7-notes' target='_blank'>released</a>, <b>ending a game content drought of over 2 months</b>. The main highlight is the first part of the Lost Tales of Axeoth campaigns: <b><a href='https://mmh7.ubi.com/en/blog/post/view/the-lost-tales-of-axeoth-unity-now-available' target='_blank'>Unity</a></b>, a 5-map campaign which adds plenty of Legacy artefacts, heroes, creatures and music to recreate some of the feelings of the original game.
<br>
The patch does also bring several changes to the game, such as adding a flat cap to the number of raised units by Necromancy, a removal of the hero level cap in Skirmish maps (Campaign and Scenarios remain unchanged), a reorganization of the main menu and several bugfixes. The patch is estimated to weigh around 2.1 GB, although some users are <a href='http://heroescommunity.com/viewthread.php3?TID=40444&PID=1354120#focus' target='_top'>reporting</a> higher numbers...</p><hr size=1 width=600><br><a name='7'><p><span class='small'>Posted by <a href='team.shtml' target='_top'>Storm-Giant</a> at 22:50, 13 Jan 2016:</span><br><span class='big'>Horn of the Abyss 1.4 Available for Download!</span><br><br>It has become a tradition for the HotA team to release a new version of their MOD at the beginning of the year, and this one isn’t any different!

<b>For the current version (1.3.1), you can report bugs <a href='http://heroescommunity.com/viewthread.php3?TID=41874' target='_top'>here</a></b>. Furthermore, the 1.4 update is <a href='https://mmh7.ubi.com/en/blog/post/view/patch-1-3-now-available' target='_blank'>confirmed</a> to be in the works, which is set to be released in the upcoming weeks.
<br><br>
Sadly, I have to inform of the end of yet another Might & Magic title. <b>Duel of Champions</b>, the Trading Card Game that received eight expansions over the course of three years, has announced that <b>it will not receive <a href='https://www.duelofchampions.com/en/news/draft-mode-deployment' target='_blank'>any additional updates</a></b>. Regular service maintenances will continue to occur for <i>"as long as we have a sufficient community of active fans"</i>. Seeing as <a href='https://www.facebook.com/MMHO.Official' target='_blank'>Heroes Online</a> has not received an update since May, one has to wonder if putting BlueByte on charge of both projects was the last nail in their coffins, or they were bound to come to an end anyway.</p><hr size=1 width=600><br><center>&gt;&gt; <a href='news.php?start=10'>Display 10 Earlier News Entries</a> &gt;&gt;</center></TD></TR></table><br>
