		<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">How I put together Power Outside The Matrix</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">by Jon Rappoport</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">March 17, 2018</span></p>
<p>Time and time again, during my 30 years as a reporter, I’ve come across what I call “the elite creation of reality.”</p>
<p>It shows up in areas of politics, energy, modern medicine, media, money, covert intelligence, the military, religion, science, multinational corporations.</p>
<p>It’s as if a painter is working on a mural, and the global population is looking at that mural and seeing it as Reality.</p>
<p>This goes deeper.  Much deeper:</p>
<p>Limited concepts of space, time, energy, the mind, cause-and-effect&#8212;these, too, are “given” to human beings as the be-all and end-all of a story.  A story that ultimately short-circuits and short-changes what the individual is really capable of.</p>
<p>The entire mural of imposed Reality is aimed at radically diminishing the individual’s power.</p>
<p>So in addition to my work as an investigative reporter, I’ve been researching the individual’s ability to go beyond this mural of reality.</p>
<p>In the late 1980s, in concert with the brilliant hypnotherapist Jack True (who gave up doing hypnosis with his patients), I developed many, many exercises and techniques for expanding the creative power of the individual.</p>
<p>Some of those exercises are included in my new collection, <span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/power-outside-the-matrix/" target="_blank"><strong>Power Outside The Matrix</strong></a></span></span>.  These techniques are aimed at accessing more energy, more imagination, more stability and intelligence “beyond the mural of reality.”</p>
<p>In fact, <strong>Power Outside The Matrix</strong> is all about being able to think, act, and create both outside and inside The Matrix.  Because that’s the goal: to be able to function in both places.</p>
<p>People are consciously or unconsciously fixated on boundaries and systems.  They are hoping for whatever can be delivered through a system.  </p>
<p>That is a form of mind control. </p>
<p>But here we are dealing with The New.  Old notions of cause and effect don’t apply.  The past doesn’t determine the present.  The way a religion or a science paints a cosmology is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Freedom isn’t a system.</p>
<p>But freedom needs creative power, otherwise it just sits there and becomes a lonely statue gathering dust in an abandoned park.</p>
<p>At one time or another, every human being who has ever lived on this planet has abandoned his creative power.  The question is: does he want to get it back?</p>
<p>It never really goes away.  It is always there.  It is the basis of a life that can be lived.  A life that can be chosen.  People instead choose roles that don’t require that power.  They think this is a winning strategy.  </p>
<p>It isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>Power Outside The Matrix</strong> features a long section called: <em>Analyzing Information in the Age of Disinformation</em>. </p>
<p>It’s filled with specific examples of my past investigations. Based on 25 years of experience, it shows you how to take apart and put together data that lead to valid conclusions. </p>
<p>It is far more than a logic course.</p>
<p>It’s an advanced approach to analysis.</p>
<p>Establishing power outside The Matrix requires that a person be able to deal with today’s flood of information, misinformation, and disinformation. I’ve left no stone unturned in bringing you a workable approach to analysis.</p>
<p>There is a further extensive section titled, <em>A Writer’s Tutorial</em>. People have been asking me to provide this Tutorial, and here it is in spades. But it’s not just for writers. It’s for any creative person who wants to grasp his own power, understand it, and use it to reach out into the world.</p>
<p>My Tutorial exposes you to lessons that go far beyond what is normally taught in writer’s seminars. In fact, several core concepts in the Tutorial contradict ordinary writer’s seminars, and thus give you access to inner resources that would otherwise be ignored.</p>
<p>Another section of this mega-collection, titled <em>Power Outside The Matrix and The Invention of New Reality</em>, features creative exercises you do on a daily basis that will help you move toward the goal of power outside The Matrix. The exercises are all about increasing your energy and stability&#8212;and about the invention of new spaces.</p>
<p>Access to your internal energy, in huge amounts, is necessary for a life outside The Matrix—rather than relying on the illusory energy that The Matrix seems to provide.</p>
<p>I’ve developed the exercises for exactly that purpose: your energy, your dynamism.</p>
<p>And finally, I have included a number of audio seminars that offer a wider perspective about The Matrix and what it means to live and work outside it.</p>

<hr />
<p><i>Here are the particulars. These are audio presentations. 55 total hours.</i></p>
<p>* Analyzing Information in the Age of Disinformation (11.5-hours)</p>
<p>* Writer’s Tutorial (8.5-hours)</p>
<p>* Power Outside The Matrix and The Invention of New Reality (6.5-hours)</p>
<p><i>Then you will receive the following audio presentations I have previously done:</i></p>
<p>* The Third Philosophy of Imagination (1-hour)</p>
<p>* The Infinite Imagination (3-hours)</p>
<p>* The Mass Projection of Events (1.5-hours)</p>
<p>* The Decentralization of Power (1.5-hours)</p>
<p>* Creating the Future (6-hours)</p>
<p>* Pictures of Reality (6-hours)</p>
<p>* The Real History of America (2-hours)</p>
<p>* Corporations: The New Gods (7.5-hours)</p>
<p><i>I have included an additional bonus section:</i></p>
<p>* The complete text (331 pages) of AIDS INC., the book that exposed a conspiracy of scientific fraud deep within the medical research establishment. The book has become a sought-after item, since its publication in 1988. It contains material about viruses, medical testing, and the invention of disease that is, now and in the future, vital to our understanding of phony epidemics arising in our midst (and how to analyze them). I assure you, the revelations in the book will surprise you; they cut much deeper and are more subtle than “virus made in a lab” scenarios.</p>
<p>* A 2-hour radio interview I did on AIDS in Dec 1987 with host Roy Tuckman on KPFK in Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p>* My book, The Secret Behind Secret Societies</p>
<p><em>(<span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/power-outside-the-matrix/" target="_blank">All the audio presentations are mp3 files and the books are pdf files</a></span></span>. You download them upon purchase. You’ll receive an email with a link to the entire collection.)</em></p>
<p>This is about your power.  Not as an abstract idea, but as a living core of your being.  This is about accessing that power and using it to invent realities without end.</p>

<p>What has been called The Matrix is a series of layers. These layers compose what we call Reality. Reality is not merely the consensus people accept in their daily lives. It is also a personal and individual conception of limits. It is a perception that these limits are somehow built into existence. But this is not true.</p>
<p>What I’ve done here is remove the lid on those perceived limits. This isn’t an intellectual undertaking. It’s a way to open up space and step on to a new road.</p>
<p>That road travels to more and more creative power, joy, and fulfillment.</p>
<p>During that great adventure, the individual experiences what has been labeled “paranormal” and “synchronistic” and “magical.” These words really don’t do us justice. They only hint at what we are and what we can do.</p>
<p>I put this collection together because it expresses, explains, and shows, in detail, how the individual can rediscover and reclaim his/her true power.</p>
<p>That process, that engagement, that life, is beyond solving problems. Our problems, at the core, exist only because we have “misplaced an infinity.”</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>The Wizard of Is</strong> surveys the world and the universe and says, “Here it all is. This is what will eliminate the need for you to invent your own world.”</p>
<p>Translation: “It will keep you in a beautiful prison forever, because all roads lead through a maze that takes you back to the beginning, where you started. Who could ask for anything more? It’s complex, it’s a Matrix, it’s challenging, it’s joyous and painful, it’s a thrill a minute. Or you can lie down go to sleep.”</p>
<p>The Wizard of Is is the maestro of What Is. He does everything he can to convince you that What Already Is is your best option, your destiny, your home of homes.</p>
<p>After that, you only have to find your place. The Wizard is very good at cooking up mumbo-jumbo about you needing a particular place and how, when you find it, things fall together and click together for you.</p>
<p>“We’re making this endless TV series called Reality and there are billions of roles available. If we can find your best role, you’ll fit it like a glove, and then you’ll be happy.”</p>
<p>The Wizard then makes sure to indicate that challenging What Is is a very difficult road. It opens you up to all sorts of dangers, he says. The Wizard has lots of experience in wielding the stick and the carrot.</p>
<p>What are some of the characteristics of What Is? It’s always there. You can always see it and look at it and get involved with it. It’s outside yourself. It’s like a vast painting in a museum—except you walk into it and live there. It’s made for you. It’s apparently seamless—once you’re inside it. It doesn’t break down and reveal rips in its fabric. It endures.</p>
<p>You can approach it from many angles—political, economic, social, medical, military, scientific. But above all, What Is is a Continuum, which is to say it’s an interlock of space-time-energy. It all fits together. Each aspect enforces and confirms every other aspect.</p>
<p>The idea of exiting from it seems absurd. You’re there, and there you will stay. Your job is to fit in, to find your place, your role, your destiny.</p>
<p>A great deal of Wizard-of-Is propaganda surrounds it. For example, you have no capacity to exceed its parameters. You can make use of technology to explore and manipulate certain pieces of What Is, but without technology you’re lost. Therefore, those who supply you with technology are your masters.</p>
<p>The Wizard states that he is your guide. He’ll help you navigate What Is to your advantage. This is your best option. Your only option.</p>
<p>All of this is a highly sophisticated form of hypnosis.</p>
<p>This external Matrix couldn’t operate at all—unless the human perceptual apparatus was designed to mesh and merge with it. But this apparatus is only a fragment of the possible range of perception.</p>
<p>The clumsy word “paranormal” is used to explain (and deny) the capacity to see beyond the structure of Matrix.</p>
<p>The Wizard says, “You don’t want to look too closely at the Matrix. It’ll lead to disillusionment. You’ll feel depressed. You won’t know what to do. You need to accept the Matrix. All happiness stems from that.”</p>
<p>However, the truth is more complex than that. You need to cultivate both an acceptance and a rejection. Here is the paradox: acceptance gives you a platform from which to reject.</p>
<p>This should have been the message of Zen for the last several thousand years. And perhaps in the hands of a certain few teachers, it was. But for the most part, the message of Zen has been about spiritual insight and breakthrough leading to acceptance.</p>
<p>That’s half a meal. It’s unstable. It breaks down. In time, the devotee finds himself at sea, cut off from his own creative power, unwilling to exercise it, for fear that he’ll overstep his mandate as a human being.</p>
<p>I cite Zen, but in fact almost every spiritual system devised in so-called civilized cultures has carried the same message. Accept What Is, period.</p>
<p>This makes the Wizard rejoice. It’s his device, his con.</p>
<p>Some years ago, I was interviewed by a host who urged me to talk about the Matrix. With every step I took, he assented and pushed me forward. But I could see in his rushed agreement all the signs that he was becoming more and more uncomfortable.</p>
<p>He was looking for a new system to replace the old. He wanted a conclusion, a wrap-up that would confirm his hypnotized belief in What Is.</p>
<p>It was, all in all, quite amusing. He was saying yes, yes, while he was thinking no, no. He wanted a better prison, a kinder warden, that’s all.</p>
<p>So I introduced the idea of the Wizard of Is. Then, I really saw him go into internal paroxysms. He looked like he was about to fall off his perch.</p>
<p>He was dedicated to systems all the way down. He wanted to be surrounded and comforted by a structure that would eliminate the need for him to do anything—while he pretended that was not the case.</p>
<p>I said, “Look, if you really like systems, invent your own. You don’t have to be living under the umbrella of someone else’s.”</p>
<p>I saw a light go on in his mind.</p>
<p>“That’s interesting,” he said slowly.</p>
<p>“Sure,” I said. “Keep on inventing systems if that’s what you want to do. Maybe some day, you’ll come to the end of it and you’ll create something you really want to that isn’t a system.”</p>
<p>“Well,” he said, “ I suppose that’s possible.”</p>
<p>After the interview, he took me aside and said, “You know, maybe I can dump that Wizard you talked about…”</p>
<p>The Wizard isn’t forever. He just acts as if he is.</p>

		<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">A personal memory of hidden realities in time and space</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">by Jon Rappoport</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">March 15, 2018</span></p>
<p>There is investigation from which hidden realities and elite figures will emerge&#8212;just as discovering what powers a home can lead to finding the far-flung generators of power for a whole metropolis.</p>
<p>But then there are investigations of another kind, which turn up strange connections among events&#8212;as if time and space make sudden detours.</p>
<p>These latter oddities are uncovered by personal reflection.  </p>
<p>In the summer of 1962, young and crazy, with very few funds, at (very) loose ends, I gave up my apartment and traveled to Cape Cod.  I spent a few weeks there and met a painter who was living in a small studio.  He generously gave me a place to sleep on his floor.  </p>
<p>I had a friend who was working as a waiter in a restaurant.  Every night, just before sunset, I would go to the back door of the place, and he would come out and hand me a plate piled high with fresh lobster and salad.  I would take it down the dock, sit, and eat my meal for the day.</p>
<p>I had already decided I wanted to paint, so the artist and I had long conversations in his studio late at night.  These talks oxygenated my blood and set my brain on fire.  I was as certain as certain could be that I was (somehow) going to paint.</p>
<p>THE DAY I returned to New York, still very short on money, and without a place to live (young and very crazy), <span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="https://outsidetherealitymachine.wordpress.com/2018/03/12/the-four-thousand-universes-of-paul-klee/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my first stop was the Metropolitan Museum of Art</a></span></span>.  I had been there for long afternoons of looking and pondering over the past year.</p>
<p>NEVER had I been to the Museum restaurant&#8212;but this day, I decided to go in and have a cup of coffee.  As I sat down, I noticed a man coming over to my table.  He was a painter who worked in a small gallery downtown.  We’d spoken a number of times there.</p>
<p>He sat down.  Within a minute or so, he told me his problem.  THAT DAY, in a few hours, he was going on vacation, to the Cape, with his girlfriend, to the town I’d just come back from.  He had a studio off 5th Avenue.  He’d been trying to lease it for the rest of the summer, but he’d failed.  Did I knew anyone who was looking for a temporary place to live?</p>
<p>Well, I said&#8212;my mind ignited by a blow torch&#8212;I was looking&#8212;but I had very little cash.</p>
<p>How much could you pay, he asked.</p>
<p>I named a ridiculous figure.</p>
<p>He shrugged and said he was mainly looking for someone who would live in the studio and take care of it until September.  I could write there and&#8212;I told him I was starting to paint and he said he had “materials” I could use. </p>
<p>I reached in my pocket and gave him the first month’s rent, and he grinned and handed me the keys.</p>
<p>An hour later, I walked into his second-floor studio on 19th Street, a few doors down from 5th Avenue (three blocks away from where I had lived for the first five years of my life).  The studio was about 60 feet long and 20 feet wide.  There was a small bed on a platform, a kitchenette, and a bathroom.       </p>
<p>There was a writing desk.  There were two easels, perhaps 20 blank canvases, a few hundred sheets of water color paper, a hundred or so tubes of acrylic paint, and a few dozen brushes.</p>
<p>Christmas on Earth, good will to all.</p>
<p>Two days later, a friend showed up in Washington Square Park and paid me back a loan I’d given him a year earlier.</p>
<p>In retrospect, trying to calculate the odds of those events smoothly transpiring…there were no odds.  What occurred was, to me, impossible but true.</p>
<p>And after a summer of painting (sometimes all day and into the night), my life was never the same again.  Painting was inventing reality.  Life was inventing reality.  </p>
<p>I had seen my mountain and gone to the top of it.</p>
<p>It was as if reality had whispered in my ear, “YOUR DESIRE IS OVERFLOWING.  GOOD. You want to bend me, you want to change me.  Good.  I’m bored with being what I am.  I’ll cut you a slice of good fortune.  Don’t be cautious.  Go all out…”</p>

		<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">Would the government let Jesus cure cancer?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">by Jon Rappoport</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">March 14, 2018</span></p>
<p>In the 1990s, I watched a federal trial in a Los Angeles courtroom. The defendant was charged with selling medical drugs without a license to practice medicine.</p>
<p>The defendant was prepared to argue that a) the substance he was selling was naturally produced in the body and b) it was effective.</p>
<p>The prosecution moved to exclude such testimony, on the grounds that it was irrelevant.</p>
<p>The judge agreed. Therefore, the trial was nasty, brutish, and short. The defendant was found guilty and sentenced to prison for several years.</p>
<p>This is how the federal bureaucracy operates. “Do you have a government-issued license to heal? No? You’re a criminal.  End of story.”</p>
<p>I believe that if Jesus of Nazareth were walking the Earth today, in the United States, he would be arrested on the same grounds.</p>
<p>This would be particularly so if he were curing cancer.</p>
<p>Imagine this extreme case: In a stadium packed with 50,000 people who have been diagnosed with cancer, Jesus of Nazareth waves his hand and cures all of them in a few seconds.</p>
<p>Now he is threatening the profits of many companies, to say nothing of the power of the government, which backs the chemo-radiation-surgery monopoly to the hilt.</p>
<p>So he is arrested. He is put on trial. He opts to defend himself without an attorney. He tells the court that curing cancer is no crime.</p>
<p>The prosecuting attorney objects. “Your Honor,” he says, “whether or not this man has cured cancer is beside the point. He has no license to practice medicine. That is why we are here today. We are simply establishing that a) he was practicing medicine and b) he has no government-issued license. That is the scope of this proceeding.”</p>
<p>The judge agrees. The verdict is issued. Guilty.</p>
<p>Of course, on another front, the major media, <span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2018/03/11/the-deeper-reason-for-drug-ads-on-television/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">who depend for their existence on pharmaceutical advertising</a></span></span>, take the ball and run with it. The networks and major newspapers seek out “experts,” who emphatically state that what Jesus of Nazareth “performed” in the stadium was mere hypnotism. It was placebo effect. Whatever sudden “remissions” may have occurred are just temporary. Tragically, the cancers will return.</p>
<p>Not only that, these 50,000 people have effectively been sidetracked and diverted from seeking “real care from real doctors.” With chemo, with radiation, with surgery, they would have stood a chance of surviving and living long normal lives.</p>
<p>Other media pundits send up this flag: “Many of those present in the stadium were clinging bitterly to their religion. They refuse to accept science. They are living in the past. They favor superstition over real medical care. In fact, they are threatening the whole basis of healthcare, since other confused and deluded Americans may now turn away from doctors and seek snake-oil salesmen and preachers for healing.”</p>
<p>From the highest perches of political power in this country, the word quietly goes out to the media: don’t follow up on those people who were in the stadium; don’t try to track them; don’t compile statistics on their survival rates; move on to other stories (distractions); let this whole madness die down.</p>
<p>But among the citizenry, an awareness spreads: the government is controlling healing through its issuance of licenses. That’s how the government is essentially protecting one form of “healing” and enabling it to become an all-encompassing cartel.</p>
<p>What would be the alternative to licenses?</p>
<p>Contracts.</p>
<p>Contracts are agreements entered into by consenting adults, who assume responsibility for the outcomes. In the case of healing, a contract would specify that people have a right to be wrong.</p>
<p>Let’s say two consenting adults, Jim and Frank, agree to allow Frank to treat Jim for his arthritis with water from a well on Frank’s land.</p>
<p>The two men acknowledge that no liability will be attached to the outcome. In other words, whether Jim gets better or gets worse, no one is going file a suit. No one is going to go to the government for redress of wrongs.</p>
<p>The well water may be wonderful or it may be completely useless. Both men understand and acknowledge that. But they assert a right to try the treatment, because they are free.</p>
<p>Immediately people say, “This is ridiculous. Water can’t cure arthritis. Frank is cheating Jim. Jim is a victim. He needs to see a doctor. He needs to go on arthritis drugs.”</p>
<p>No, Jim doesn’t have to do anything. He is free.</p>
<p>To put it another way, Jim has the right to be right or wrong. It’s his decision, which is beyond the scope of any authority.</p>
<p>If government tries to remove that right from all of us, it is essentially saying it knows what is correct, it knows what is true, it knows what we need and require, and it’s going to give it to us even if it has to shove it down our throats. Does that sound like freedom to you?</p>
<p>If Jesus of Nazareth lived in the United States today, and if he went around curing cancer, he would be arrested. He wouldn’t be charged with blasphemy or treason. He would be charged with something much simpler and more mundane: practicing medicine without a license.</p>
<p>And he would be convicted and sentenced.</p>
<p>Because the government, in its throne of corruption, in its partnership with corporations, wants to monopolize proprietary and illegal interests.</p>

		<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">The club of liberal messiahs floods the world with love</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">by Jon Rappoport</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">March 14, 2018</span></p>
<p>By liberals, I simply mean those people who accept big government as a given, regardless of their political affiliation.  </p>
<p>And yes, at certain key levels, they are a club.  They come from major media, large corporations, banks, the military, well-funded foundations, investment houses, do-good non-profits, legal and medical societies, academic factories, think tanks, and of course the huge pool of government employees.</p>
<p>They come from immigrants and welfare recipients.  </p>
<p>They come from all levels of society.</p>
<p>For them, big, bigger, and biggest government is a rock-bottom assumption that requires no thought.  The sun comes up every morning, and there is big government.</p>
<p>This assumption supersedes anything written in the US Constitution explicitly limiting the power of central authority.  </p>
<p>Where there is conflict between that document and the actions of government, the Constitution automatically takes a back seat.  It is looked upon as a primitive, ancient, and worn-out set of ideas.</p>
<p>In fact, the Club is surprised and shocked that anyone would try to impede government based on fanciful notions about powers reserved for the individual states.</p>
<p>Long ago, the Club decided that every statement made in the Constitution was subject to revision or outright dismissal, based on the arrogant concept that changing times require new extreme measures and solutions.</p>
<p>In their eyes, they are working with reality, whereas Constitutionalists have a quirky and disturbing obsession that clings to absolute Principle.  If Principle isn&#8217;t a sign of a mental disorder, it at least indicates an unhealthy nostalgia about a fairy tale of days gone by.</p>
<p>The Club blithely assumes it has won its battle.  </p>
<p>The Club is focused on what big government, in concert with its corporate and banking allies, can do to further expand.    </p>
<p>For some Club members, the mission of government is to do good, to give to those in need, no matter how many are in need or how much that need grows.  </p>
<p>For other Club members, at higher levels, the massive giveaway and fulfilling of need is just a pose, a tactic to gain more adherents who will trade a great deal of their freedom for a little security.</p>
<p>But there is no debate within the Club about this matter.  No one wants to rock the boat.  Those at higher levels view the do-gooders within their ranks as useful and amusing dupes.</p>
<p>The do-gooders, if they glimpse the faces and intentions of the higher-ups, shrug it off, assuming that somehow, in the long run, the vision of “a shared and just world” will triumph.</p>
<p><em>The Club has one major enemy.</em></p>
<p><strong>Abundance.</strong></p>
<p>The idea that there is enough for everyone who wants to work for it, the idea that individuals can pursue their deepest dreams and desires, and win&#8230;that is anathema.  </p>
<p>Why?  Because if that perception operated widely in the society, it would rule out the grasping need for invasive central government.</p>
<p>Therefore, creating artificial scarcities is at the top of the Club&#8217;s to-do list.  Of course, this agenda must be masked behind false cover. The scarcities must seem to be inevitable, or at least caused by forces beyond our control.</p>
<p>Scarcity of money, health, prosperity, freedom, property, sanity, natural resources&#8230;they must appear to be naturally occurring crises, for which the only answer is parental control over populations.</p>
<p>When Buckminster Fuller offered his analysis of abundance and how we could achieve it on planet Earth, he was missing one piece: who would implement it?  Who would revolutionize life for all?</p>
<p>The obvious answer is: the people in charge.  But that doesn&#8217;t work, for the simple reason that those people are dedicated to producing false scarcities.</p>
<p>To reject abundance, the elite Club of Rome published its famous study, <span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://collections.dartmouth.edu/published-derivatives/meadows/pdf/meadows_ltg-001.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>“The Limits to Growth,”</em></a></span></span> in 1972.  It essentially used computer modeling to predict failure for civilization, and ushered in a tsunami of propaganda aimed at floating the planet&#8217;s only hope for survival: a recognition of global interdependence and the distribution of the world&#8217;s resources from a point of Central Planning.</p>
<p>This concept, in turn, was translated to mean “addressing needs.”</p>
<p>The conclusion?  Big government was the addresser, the single most important institution for saving us all.</p>
<p>Hand in hand, elite planners and propagandists invented a loop that guaranteed the primacy of a bill of needs over a bill of rights.</p>
<p>Individual freedom stood accused in the dock as the criminal.  It had led to a world out of balance.</p>
<p>Members of the Club, sitting in their massive London drawing rooms and their Park Avenue apartments, applauded this “progression of awareness.”</p>
<p>To say they were laughing up their sleeves would be a vast understatement.</p>
<p>From FDR to Truman, from Eisenhower to Kennedy, from LBJ to Nixon, from Ford to Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George Bush, Bill Clinton, Bush Jr., the Club watched their plans solidify.  Regardless of what these presidents said or did, government expanded, and the official status of “fulfilling needs” was welded ever more securely to government&#8217;s mission.</p>
<p>Finally, in a considerable victory, to symbolically signify the emergence of the “lowest to the highest,” a man who represented former slaves on the American continent took up residence in the White House.</p>
<p>He, above previous presidents, would raise the sword to equalize all status in society.  He would right past wrongs, square past debts, and fly the flag of humanity.  Justice would be served.</p>
<p>No matter that the condition of “his own people” would worsen during his reign.  No matter that the condition of all Americans would diminish.  No matter that he was the agent of an operation designed to put the crown on government as the great provider.</p>
<p>Buddha to Jesus to Karl Marx&#8212;the Club has borrowed sentiments of high hope and realization, in order to sell its program.  The Club has cast its role as the messianic force.  It has filled the pews of its church with followers, who have no clue as to the actual plan, but instead mouth the words and sing the songs and praise the gifts.</p>
<p>The marketing of these sentiments, their weave, fabric, tone, and flow are the substance of a trance induction.</p>
<p>And at the end of the line?  America harmonized in its structure with other nations, and the subsuming of the USA under a regional and global arch of management.  </p>
<p>As David Rockefeller, one of the designers of the plan, put it in his 2003 Memoirs: “Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as &#8216;internationalists&#8217; and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure — one world, if you will. If that is the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.”</p>
<p>There are millions of people who refuse to believe that a high humanitarian sentiment or ideal can be deployed to defeat us.  They automatically assume that what stirs them is for the good.</p>
<p>They are crowded together in the middle of the trance.  They clog the arteries of the body politic.  They foment a disease of the public immune system attacking itself, and it is long past the time when they should wake up and cure their distorted perception.</p>
<p>But as far as the Club is concerned, they are useful.  And useful they will stay, as long as they can be hypnotized into the future glory that lies just over the next hill.</p>
<p>And now we come to the technocrats.</p>
<p>The technocrats among Club leaders consider the overall mission in terms of a systems fix.  There are flaws in the way humans have chosen to organize themselves, and these flaws need to be corrected.</p>
<p>With the important information entered into computers armed with algorithms, models can be obtained.  These models will take into account vital resources, such as water, breathable air, earth minerals, fuel, food crops, transportation, housing, education, medical care, and so on.  Planetary allocation quotas for all territories and regions can be arrived at&#8212;and the distribution can come from a centralized point of control.</p>
<p>Dispassionately, the human condition can be modified.  </p>
<p>The technocrats consider this an interesting problem.  It will take work, but it can be solved.</p>
<p>Certain factors, however, must be reduced or eliminated.  Freedom, choice, personal decision-making have to be devalued in the new System, in order to avoid the introduction of random and unpredictable outcomes.</p>
<p>The very meaning of a technocratic system precludes freedom as an objective, because that quality of humans isn&#8217;t circumscribed and can&#8217;t be inserted as a pure passive object into calculations.</p>
<p>Technocrats value systems above all.  They live to build self-referential closed structures.  </p>
<p>Technocrats are, in a sense, a separate species.  They are intensely cerebral.  They view human beings as troublesome pieces of a puzzle.  A system is erected on the basis of built-in controls.  Humans tend not to fit.</p>
<p>This they find annoying.  But there are ways to limit the trouble.  Chemicals can be introduced into the brain.  The chemicals will regulate behavior.  The drugs we now have are only a minor step in the right direction.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all in the service of a “better system,” which is what technocrats must have.  They would wither and die if they couldn&#8217;t have it.  They would feel isolated and useless and rejected.</p>
<p>If you want to see a technocrat squirm and wriggle and scream, like a person being tortured, take away his access to systems.</p>
<p>The greatest acceleration of human organization took place in the century just past.  The obsession for big, bigger, and biggest flowered as never before.  Now, in this century, the push is for refinement.  To the technocrat, that means much greater definition of roles for humans.</p>
<p>Specialization will take on new restrictions and regulations.  Plugging people into a system is one thing; carefully ordering their limits and restraints is another.</p>
<p>Take the long view of this century.  The overall aim is for a structure that will encompass the actions of every human on Earth; every person with a designated function rigorously placed in the correct slot.</p>
<p>This will be promoted as salvation.  It will be floated as the genius of the species finally taking hold.</p>
<p>And somewhere today, a young person, filled to the brim with vague ideals and hope, buying the promise that everyone&#8217;s needs will be met, that suffering and pain and injustice will be solved, has no clue that such pretty thoughts can be hijacked in the service of building a system to eradicate what it means to be alive.</p>
<p>This young person thinks freedom, liberty, and the intentions of the withered piece of paper called the Constitution are frivolous obstructions to a better world.  </p>
<p>Dispense with the absurd Constitution.  It isn&#8217;t part of the modern trend.  Instead, join the crowd.  Shout with delight for the political salvation that is only a few more joined hands from realization.</p>
<p>Forget. Believe.  Go along.</p>
<p>Reject as absurd the possibility that elite planners have a completely different version of the world in tow.</p>
<p>Yell for equality, whatever that may be shaped to mean.</p>
<p>Think about nothing.  Just swim into the days with faith born from what our leaders are selling on the shore of the new shining city.</p>
<p>Believe.  Trust.</p>
<p>Your job isn&#8217;t to imagine and invent your own reality.  That is a meaningless proposition.</p>
<p>No, your job is to love the State because the State loves you.</p>

		<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">Chemical-dosing experiment to force friendship toward migrants: not science fiction</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">by Jon Rappoport</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">March 13, 2018</span></p>
<p>I really hope you understand this.</p>
<p>It is not a fantasy.  It isn’t science fiction.  It isn’t satire.</p>
<p>It is Brave New World, but not the Huxley novel.  It’s happening now.</p>
<p>It’s a published study that appears on the website of the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.</p>
<p>The title of the study is, “Oxytocin-enforced norm compliance reduces xenophobic outgroup rejection.” (Reference: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2017 Aug 29;114(35):9314-9319.)</p>
<p>Xenophobia is defined as: “fear or hatred of foreigners, people from different cultures, or strangers.”  (Dictionary.com)</p>
<p>Oxytocin, the chemical used in this study, is described by Medical News Today: “Widely referred to as the love hormone, oxytocin has also been dubbed the hug hormone, cuddle chemical, moral molecule, and the bliss hormone due to its effects on behavior, including its role in love and in female reproductive biological functions in reproduction.”</p>
<p>“Oxytocin is a hormone that is made in the brain, in the hypothalamus. It is transported to, and secreted by, the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain.”</p>
<p>The published study details a successful attempt at chemical mind control.  The goal is making people more “happy and friendly” about mass migration, by changing their hormonal response toward migrants.</p>
<p>Nothing in the study cites inherent migration problems, such as increased violent crime, back-breaking financial pressure on government budgets, and the eroding of local cultures.  It’s all about shifting feeling and reaction toward waves of immigrants.</p>
<p>Here are extensive quotes from the new study:   </p>
<p>“Here we report the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment showing that enhanced activity of the oxytocin system paired with charitable social cues [programming] can help counter the effects of xenophobia by fostering altruism toward refugees. These findings suggest that the combination of oxytocin and peer-derived altruistic norms [social cues] reduces outgroup rejection [toward migrants] even in the most selfish and xenophobic individuals, and thereby would be expected to increase the ease by which people adapt to rapidly changing social ecosystems [mass immigration].”</p>
<p>“…we tested the propensity of 183 Caucasian participants to make donations to people in need, half of whom were refugees (outgroup) and half of whom were natives (ingroup). Participants scoring low on xenophobic attitudes [showing they already accept mass immigration] exhibited an altruistic preference for the outgroup, which further increased after nasal delivery of the neuropeptide oxytocin. In contrast, participants with higher levels of xenophobia generally failed to exhibit enhanced altruism toward the outgroup. This tendency was only countered by pairing oxytocin with peer-derived altruistic norms [social-programming cues], resulting in a 74% increase in refugee-directed donations. Collectively, these findings reveal the underlying sociobiological conditions associated with outgroup-directed altruism by showing that charitable social cues co-occurring with enhanced activity of the oxytocin system reduce the effects of xenophobia by facilitating prosocial behavior toward refugees.”</p>
<p>The truly disturbing and mind-boggling aspect of this study is: many people would accept it as a reasonable way to “solve” the migrant crisis.</p>
<p>Forget about the actual effects of immigration.  They’re irrelevant.  Instead, focus on re-shaping people’s minds, through chemical intervention combined with social programming.</p>
<p>The authors of the mind-control study are basically saying, “If you have a problem with mass immigration, the problem has nothing to do with facts.  It only has to do with your hormone system.  Basically, you have a deficit of oxytocin.”</p>
<p>I have written many articles about the effects of philosophic materialism, including its conclusion that humans are merely biological machines and, therefore, can be manipulated at will by “those in charge.”</p>
<p>Free will?  A delusion.  Individual choice?  Unacceptable.  Humans are inherently programmed in every respect, and badly programmed at that.  The central flaws must be fixed.  Humans must be reconfigured so they automatically respond to stimuli in new ways.  ‘More humane ways.’</p>
<p>Lost in this study, as well, are the effects of dosing with oxytocin on a person’s overall hormone system.  You don’t suddenly ramp up one hormone without changing levels of others&#8212;testosterone, for example.  But who cares, when the social and political goal must be attained?  If men become more passive in the process, why not?</p>
<p>Perhaps that notion will be the formation of the next study.  “Let’s cut testosterone and see what happens.  How much of it do we need to reduce before men just lie around and play with toys and dolls?”</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the authors of the study never considered dosing male immigrants of military age with the oxytocin “love hormone.”  Heaven forbid.  That would be “interfering in their culture.”</p>
<p>That’s called a clue.</p>
<p>In Brave New World, Huxley included every kind of programming he could imagine: genetically controlled, synthetic, motherless, incubator pregnancy and birth, during which extensive mind control was applied; consequent separation of classes of humans, relative to their assigned work and social relations; elimination of the traditional family; erasure of all hostile impulses; societal norms constructed to encourage physical pleasure as the highest ideal; and a “miracle drug,” Soma, ready at hand to dispel the depression and doubt that might somehow creep through and survive the massive programming.  The “inevitable outcome?”  EVERYONE WILL BE HAPPY.</p>
<p>In one stage or another, all these strategies are now being pushed forward toward a Technocratic future.</p>
<p>With Utopian justice for all.</p>
<p>Again, the proposition on which this lunacy is based is: freedom does not exist.  It was always an illusion.  Humans have never been anything more than programmed bio-machines.  Therefore, ANY level and degree of re-programming is justified.</p>
<p>Objections to this crusade are merely part of the illusion that freedom is real.</p>
<p>However, freedom IS real.  How individuals view it and what they do with it is an entirely different matter.  If they see it as nothing more than choosing between a vacation in Disney World and Las Vegas, choosing between reruns of CSI and Matlock, then Brave New World will seem like a minor change.</p>
<p>Conceiving, realizing, and experiencing freedom as a vast space and a vast platform for individual action&#8212;creative action, meaningful action&#8212;THAT is a prerequisite for the survival of life as we know it.</p>
<p>The life we hold dear.</p>
<p>Who defines “meaningful action?”  </p>
<p>You do.</p>

		<p><span style="font-size:x-large;">Shocker: Comparing deaths from medical treatment, vitamins, all US wars</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">by Jon Rappoport</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">March 13, 2018</span></p>
<p>Why do I keep writing on this subject?  </p>
<p>Hmm, let’s see&#8212;because extraordinary numbers of people are dying, and are severely maimed.  That’s a pretty good reason.  </p>
<p>Because medical and government and press authorities are lying through their teeth and covering up the numbers.  </p>
<p>Because some of the people who are dying could be people you know and love, in your family, in your circle of friends.  </p>
<p>Because the facts are clear&#8212;no speculation or opinion required.</p>
<p>Because this is not a one-time occurrence.  It is ongoing.</p>
<p>Because I’m going out on a limb, with outrageous self-confidence, and assuming that continuing to live is better than experiencing an early and unnecessary death.</p>
<p>Because you might send this article to people who will learn about this shocking subject for the first time.</p>
<p>Because, no matter which country you live in, medical destruction parallels what has been happening in the US.   </p>
<p>People want to believe medical science gives us, at any given moment, the best of all possible worlds.</p>
<p>And of course, the best of all possible worlds must have its enemies: the quacks who sell unproven snake oil.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s look at some facts.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve been documenting for years, the medical cartel has been engaged in massive criminal fraud, presenting their drugs as safe and effective across the board&#8212;when, in fact, these drugs have been killing and maiming huge numbers of people, like clockwork.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve cited the groundbreaking review, “Is US Health Really the Best in the World?”, by Dr. Barbara Starfied (Journal of the American Medical Association, July 26, 2000), in which Starfield reveals the American medical system kills 225,000 people per year&#8212;106,000 as a direct result of pharmaceutical drugs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve now found another study, published in the same Journal, two years earlier: April 15, 1998; “Incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions in Hospitalized Patients.”  It, too, is mind-boggling.</p>
<p>The authors, led by Jason Lazarou, culled 39 previous studies on patients in hospitals.  These patients, who received drugs in hospitals, or were admitted to hospitals because they were suffering from the drugs doctors had given them, met the following fate:</p>
<p>Every year, in the US, between 76,000 and 137,000 hospitalized patients die as a direct result of the drugs.  </p>
<p>Beyond that, every year 2.2 million hospitalized patients experience serious adverse reactions to the drugs.</p>
<p>The authors write: “&#8230;Our study on ADRs [Adverse Drug Reactions], which excludes medication errors, had a different objective: to show that there are a large number of ADRs even when the drugs are properly prescribed and and administered.”</p>
<p>So this study had nothing to do with doctor errors, nurse errors, or improper combining of drugs.  And it only counted people killed who were admitted to hospitals.  It didn&#8217;t begin to tally all the people taking pharmaceuticals who died as consequence of the drugs, without being admitted to hospitals.</p>
<p>I found the link to this study at the Dr. Rath Health Foundation, in the middle of a very interesting article by Dr. Aleksandra Niedzwiecki: “Commentary on the Safety of Vitamins.”</p>
<p>Here are two key quotes from her article:</p>
<p>“In 2010, not one single person [in the US] died as a result of taking vitamins (Bronstein, et al, (2011) Clinical Toxical, 49 (10), 910-941).”</p>
<p>“In 2004, the deaths of 3 people [in the US] were attributed to the intake of vitamins.  Of these, 2 persons were said to have died as a result of megadoses of vitamins D and E, and one person as a result of an overdose of iron and fluoride.  Data from: &#8216;Toxic Exposure Surveillance System 2004, Annual Report, Am. Assoc. of Poison Control Centers.&#8217;”</p>
<p>Summing up: </p>
<p>No deaths from vitamins (2011), and three deaths (2004) from vitamins/iron/fluoride.  </p>
<p>106,000 deaths every year from pharmaceutical drugs. (Starfield).  </p>
<p>Between 76,000 and 137,000 deaths from pharmaceutical drugs every year in hospitalized patients.  (Lazerou).</p>
<p>The FDA and its “quack-buster” allies go after vitamins, demean “unproven remedies,” and generally take every possible opportunity to warn people about “alternatives,” on the basis that they aren&#8217;t scientifically supported.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the very drugs these mobsters are promoting, and certifying as safe and effective, are killing and maiming people at a staggering rate.</p>
<p>The masses are treated to non-stop PR on the glories of the US medical system.</p>
<p>In the Wikipedia entry, “US military casualties of war,” the grand total of all military deaths in the history of this country, starting with the Revolutionary War, is 1,312,612.</p>
<p>In any given 10 years of modern medical treatment?  2,250,000 deaths (Starfield).</p>
<p>Consider how much suppression is necessary to keep the latter number under wraps.</p>
<p>And oh yes, one more thing: none of the studies cited above examine the destruction wrought by vaccines.  That’s forbidden.</p>
