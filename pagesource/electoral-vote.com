<h4><a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2018/Senate/Maps/Mar17.html#item-1"> McCabe Fired in "Friday Night Slaughter" </a> </h4>
<p>Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was scheduled to retire tomorrow,
with a pension reflecting his 20 years of service to his country. However, in a
development that was simultaneously petty, deeply concerning, and entirely
foreseeable, McCabe was
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/us/politics/andrew-mccabe-fbi-fired.html" target="_blank">fired</a>
by Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Friday night.</p>

<!--ENDFEED-->

<p>The official reason that McCabe was fired is that when he talked to FBI
inspectors during an internal review of one of his decisions (to allow agents to
speak with reporters about an investigation into the Clinton Foundation in
2016), he was not "candid" enough. While that is technically a fireable offense,
it is the kind of thing that is generally overlooked (think of how many current
cabinet officers were not "candid" enough during their confirmation hearings),
or else that results in a compromise that the guilty party retires so as to avoid
formal sanctions. McCabe, in fact, had already effectively retired&#8212;he
stopped doing actual work months ago, and was using accrued leave time to cover
the gap until he reached his retirement date, which he would have done
tomorrow. Under any other president, he almost certainly would have been allowed
to go quietly into the night, and that would have been that.</p>

<p>But Donald Trump isn't any other president, and McCabe's lack of candor isn't
the real issue. The true reason that McCabe was fired is that Donald Trump hates
him and, more significantly, hates what he represents (or, at least, what he
represents to the President). First of all, though McCabe is a registered
Republican, his wife is a Democrat. She ran for the Virginia state senate and
got a big donation from a super PAC controlled by then-governor Terry McAuliffe,
a close friend of the Clintons. Ipso facto, as far as The Donald is concerned,
McCabe is a Democrat and a close friend of Hillary Clinton, and so is a "deep
state" mole trying to bring down the Trump administration from within. None of
this, of course, is supported by any evidence. However, it does lead to Trump's
second complaint about McCabe: That because he's a mole, he didn't do enough to
hammer Hillary for her e-mail server. This matter was examined exhaustively, of
course, and there wasn't enough to hammer Hillary. And even if McCabe had wanted
to do so, it wasn't his call, it was then-director James Comey's. And that leads
us to the third and final problem, namely that McCabe is part of the FBI, which
Trump thinks is out to get him. He's already fired the director (Comey), and he
hasn't been able to bring himself to fire special counsel Robert Mueller. That
leaves McCabe as the biggest, juiciest target at the Bureau. To put all of this
more succinctly, McCabe embodies virtually all of the things that anger Trump
the most&#8212;Russiagate, "Crooked Hillary," the FBI, Barack Obama, the deep
state&#8212;and he is, unlike most of the other windmills Trump is tilting at,
within the President's reach. So, of course Trump desperately wanted to fire
him.</p>

<p>The problem for Trump is that, yet again, he has put short-term gain ahead of
long-term pain. Here are the main problems he just created for himself:</p>

<ul>

<li><span class="bold">Votes</span>: It is inconceivable that Donald Trump
gained a single vote for himself or his party on Friday night. Undoubtedly,
there are many in the Breitbart/Infowars crowd that truly believe McCabe was a
shill, a mole, a Clinton lackey, etc., but they were already voting for Trump.
Nobody was brought into the Trump camp with the firing. On the other hand, the
President's decision looks petty and selfish, and politicizes the law
enforcement apparatus, which is supposed to be (and needs to be) apolitical.
There is much in common with Dick Nixon's decision to fire two attorneys general
and the special prosecutor in 1974, and to try to sweep it under the rug by
doing it late on a weekend night. Doing it that way added "cowardly" to the
list, along with selfish, petty, etc. The parallels to the Saturday Night
Massacre are strong enough that historian David Brinkley is already
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/03/17/mccabe-firing-friday-night-slaughter-brinkley-sot-ctn.cnn" target="_blank">referring</a> 
to yesterday's events as the "Friday Night Slaughter." In Nixon's case, his
approval rating began to crater immediately after the Massacre. In Trump's case,
his approval is already quite low; maybe it will go even lower. Beyond that,
there are people who will see that a hardworking public servant was just
deprived of his well-earned retirement money for less-than-noble reasons, and at
the hands of a man who has never had to worry about money in his life. There is
no question that will cost Trump some votes.<br /><br /></li>

<li><span class="bold">McCabe Unleashed</span>: A savvier political operator
might have realized, as LBJ put it, that it's sometimes better to have enemies
"inside the tent pissing out, as opposed to outside the tent pissing in." Trump
might have been wise to dispatch an underling to chat with McCabe, and to make a
deal that he would be allowed to retire with dignity if he agreed to button his
lip. Now, however, McCabe has no reason to be silent. He's already  
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/16/politics/mccabe-fired-statement-fbi-deputy-director/index.html" target="_blank">spoken out</a>,
blasting "this Administration's ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the
Special Counsel investigation." He is going to be a popular guest on CNN, MSNBC,
the Sunday news shows, etc. for a good long time. He's undoubtedly also going to
file a lawsuit, which probably won't be succesful, but will keep this matter in
the headlines for months. And he might just get to depose Trump under oath, with all that entails.<br /><br /></li>

<li><span class="bold">The FBI Unleashed</span>: Certainly, some FBI agents are
Republicans, just as some are Democrats. But, almost without exception, their
first loyalty is to the Bureau. There can be no doubt that Trump is now at
war with them, and they will certainly close ranks. At the same time they are
watching one another's backs, they will also be watching extra closely for
evidence of malfeasance by members of the administration. Sparring with the FBI 
<a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2018/Senate/Maps/Feb02.html#item-2" target="_blank">rarely works out well</a> 
for presidents, and that's before we consider that this particular president's
closet has so many skeletons it could be confused with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catacombs_of_Paris" target="_blank">Paris catacombs</a>.<br /><br /></li>

<li><span class="bold">The Bureaucracy</span>: Everyone in the government has
now been put on notice that their future, including the pension they have earned
over the years, is subject to being snuffed out if they offend the President.
This, needless to say, will not be good for morale. Donald Trump probably does
not care about that, but there are two things that he really <i>should</i> care
about. First, it is the bureaucrats who actually carry out the president's
policies; their significance is so great that political scientists sometimes
refer to the bureaucracy as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_branch_of_government#Administrative_agencies" target="_blank">fourth branch</a> 
of the government. If their enthusiasm is low, Trump's policies won't be as
vigorously carried out as he would like, and they may not be carried out at all.
Second, while The Donald is happy to leave a lot of jobs vacant, he does have to
hire some people. And every time he behaves in this manner, that gets
harder.</li>

</ul>

<p>In short, whether the President realizes it or not, he shot himself in the
foot on Friday night. And he's not the only one who took a hit. In theory, Jeff
Sessions is supposed to place the law above politics, and is supposed to be an
advocate for the Constitution. Most AGs, including the two Nixon
fired all those years ago, would have refused Trump's order. Sessions, on the
other hand, announced to the world that he's just a partisan stooge. Similarly,
Chief of Staff John Kelly has been portrayed as a moderating force who keeps
Trump from doing too much damage. However, the President deviated enormously
from constitutional norms on Friday night, and Kelly stood by and did nothing.
It's true that he might not have been able to stop the President but, like
Sessions, he could have resigned and he did not. It's another reminder that not
only are there no grown-ups in the White House, the problem is getting worse. </p>

<p>On the other hand, it is at least possible that Sessions genuinely thinks he is doing what is best for the country.
He knows that if he refused to fire McCabe, then Trump would fire him and replace him with someone
(Scott Pruitt?) who would fire Robert Mueller.
Using this reasoning, Sessions might be thinking that on the whole, punishing McCabe is a small price to
pay to keep Mueller on the job. Four-dimensional chess anyone?

<h4><a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2018/Senate/Maps/Mar17.html#item-2"> Trump Claims Daniels Violated Hush-Money Agreement 20 Times </a> </h4>
<p>There is more news on the porn front today, which, although exciting, would not be a top story, except for the fact
that it fits in closely with today's theme: Trump lashes out to punish people he doesn't like.
Up until now, Donald Trump has kept the hush-money case involving porn star Stormy Daniels (whose real name is
Stephanie Clifford) at arm's length. He has claimed to know nothing about it or about the $130,000 that his lawyer, Michael Cohen,
paid Daniels via a Delaware shell company. On Friday, that suddenly changed. Trump's lawyers filed a motion to move 
Daniels' lawsuit from state court in Los Angeles to federal court, possibly because federal courts tend to enforce
arbitration agreements more strictly than California courts. In a second motion, Trump has personally joined the case,
which technically involves Cohen's shell company, Essential Consultants.</p>

<p>The big question here is: "Why is Trump doing this?" Any PR consultant would have told him to just ignore the whole
mess, let Daniels do her thing, call it fake news, and by November it will all be forgotten.
By jumping into the mix personally, Trump has insured that the story remains on the front page of the
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/us/trumps-stormy-daniels-lawsuit.html" target="_blank"><i>New York Times</i></a>,
the
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/trump-attorney-accuses-stormy-daniels-of-violating-nondisclosure-agreement-20-times-claims-right-to-seek-20-million-in-damages/2018/03/16/a5fd1686-296b-11e8-b79d-f3d931db7f68_story.html" target="_blank"><i>Washington Post</i></a>,
<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/16/trumps-attorney-says-stormy-daniels-violated-hush-agreement-asks-20-million/434223002/" target="_blank"><i>USA Today</i></a>,
and just about every other major paper in the country, as well as thousands of other news outlets, for days, if not weeks or months.</p>

<p>We don't know (yet) why he is keeping such a damaging story alive, but it might be due to one of four reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="bold">You can't teach an old dog new tricks</span>:
Trump has used bullying and intimidation tactics his entire life, in cases large and small, and often the strategy
has worked. One time he signed a contract with a small piano store to deliver $100,000 worth of pianos to his hotels,
and after they were delivered, he
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/09/28/i-sold-trump-100000-worth-of-pianos-then-he-stiffed-me/?utm_term=.bc195bcab904" target="_blank">refused to pay</a>.
The piano store eventually accepted $70,000, which was a big hit to the owner.
Trump may be thinking: "Playing hardball always works, so why stop now?" Of course, he wasn't in the bright glare of
the national spotlight back then.<br /> <br /> </li>

<li><span class="bold">Daniels has something really damaging</span>:
It is possible that Daniels has something really damaging or embarrassing. Photos? He could say she just photographed
one of her professional colleagues. Who would know? Maybe he has a previously unknown tattoo that most people don't
know about. Trump could claim that wife #2, Marla Maples, told Daniels about it. Videos? Harder to deny, but is that
really damaging? Could he have given her a list of 25 other porn stars he has "known" (in the Biblical sense)?<br /> <br /> </li>

<li><span class="bold">He's sending a message to other former "friends"</span>:
Steve Bannon has said that there are many other women with NDA's out there. With Daniels, the pussy is out of the 
bag. However, if the others really exist, this may be an attempt to maintain their silence. One extramarital
affair is probably survivable. But 10? 20? 50? Perhaps Trump doesn't want to find out.<br /> <br /></li>

<li><span class="bold">He thinks his base will eat it up</span>:
After the "Access Hollywood" tape came out, his base, especially the blue-collar men in it, didn't react with horror.
It reacted with jealousy. Many of his supporters envied him for being able to get away with stuff that would land them
in jail and/or in divorce court. Possibly his demonstration of power and bullying will rev up his base, or at least he thinks it will.</li>

</ul>

<p>On the other hand, there is a potential downside to giving this story more
legs than a millipede. Women, especially college-educated suburban Republican
women, who don't care about the affair or even the hush money may be upset about
Trump bullying a woman, especially a woman who kept her part of the bargain for
10 years and has now been made a pawn in a larger game, not unlike Monica
Lewinsky in an earlier presidency. It is hard to see how Trump will gain new
supporters by keeping this story in the news (although it may fire up old ones),
but it is easy to see how he could lose women who have supported him up until
now (kind of like with McCabe; see above). It's a big gamble for Trump, but
after all, he used to own casinos. Until they all failed. (V)</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2018/Senate/Maps/Mar17.html#item-3"> Trump Wants More Tariffs </a> </h4>
<p>While Donald Trump is wildly inconsistent on many issues, such as the dreamers, there are a few core issues where he has held
the same position for decades. One of these is trade. He sees the U.S. as a real sap that is being taken advantage of
by China and other countries, and he is prepared to reverse that, whatever the cost. The tariffs on steel and aluminum
are just step 1. Now comes step 2. As early as next week, Trump 
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/us/politics/trump-china-trade-measures.html" target="_blank">intends to impose</a>
tariffs on at least $30 billion worth of Chinese exports to the U.S.
The tariffs could hit high-tech products like semiconductors, but also low-tech products like shoes.</p>

<p>If Trump follows through, it will divide the U.S. badly. Some companies will be happy to be protected from
Chinese competition, but others will find their supply chains disrupted. In addition, China could
easily retaliate by putting a tariff on imports, varying from Boeing aircraft to Microsoft software. If China
retaliates, Trump could hit back and before long, there could be a full-blown trade war.</p>

<p>Related to actual trade is the issue of what China is doing with the billions of dollars it is earning by
selling products in the U.S. Part of that money is going into buying U.S. companies, some of them in critical
industries or military suppliers. Trump wants to stop that. Again, if he follows through, there is a real risk of retaliation with
unknown consequences. And by the way, the only country capable of putting any pressure at all on North Korea is
China. So if trump gets into a real food fight with Chinese President Xi Jinping, he probably shouldn't count on

<h4><a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2018/Senate/Maps/Mar17.html#item-4"> Russia Could Have Turned Off the Electricity in the U.S. </a> </h4>
<p>By now we know that Russia almost certainly meddled with the 2016 elections, but that wasn't the only thing it was up to.
The Department of Homeland Security has
<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/15/politics/dhs-fbi-russia-power-grid/index.html" target="_blank">accused</a>
Russia of infiltrating the U.S. power grid, along with other pieces of critical infrastructure, including
nuclear plants, water, aviation, and manufacturing. Vikram Thakhur, a technical director at cybersecurity firm Symantec, 
said Russia was positioned to cause major damage to the U.S. infrastructure. The tools were all in place.
All that was needed was for Russian President Vladimir Putin to give the go-ahead.</p>

<p>A cyberattack would put the U.S. in uncharted waters. Suppose Putin turned off the electricity in a major
U.S. city for days or weeks and denied doing it? Suppose he froze the federal air traffic control system so no
planes could fly for days or weeks and denied doing anything? This puts the president in a fundamentally new
bind. When Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, there wasn't a lot of doubt about who did it. Furthermore, it was a
pretty clear act of war and countries know how to respond when they are attacked by a foreign power: 
They declare war and send out the troops and bombers. 
What happens if the lights go out and Putin says Xi did it and Xi says Putin did it?
The U.S. is woefully unprepared for a cyberwar, but it may well be that the next war is fought
in cyberspace. What we have seen so far is undoubtedly just a small warm-up exercise.
It could (and probably will) get a lot worse. (V)</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2018/Senate/Maps/Mar17.html#item-5"> Tarkanian Dropping Out of Nevada Senatorial Primary </a> </h4>
<p>The Republicans got some good news yesterday, when perennial losing candidate Danny Tarkanian 
<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/16/danny-tarkanian-drop-dean-heller-primary-challenge-423361?lo=ap_b1" target="_blank">dropped out</a>
of the Nevada Senate race at the urging of Donald Trump. Tarkanian had almost no chance of winning, but he
could well have forced Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) far to the right and made him unelectable in the general election.
He could also have forced Heller to spend a ton of money on the primary and might have badly divided the Republican Party
while going down in flames. Now none of that will happen. Heller now has a clear shot at the nomination with no
obstacles in the way. Tarkanian will now run for a House seat.</p>

<p>That said, Heller is far from home free.
He has a formidable general election opponent in Rep. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), who also has no primary opponent of note.
This means Heller and Rosen can start the general election campaign tomorrow, 8 months before the election. Heller
is one of the weakest Republican incumbents, so the Democrats are going to put everything they have got into this race.</p>

<p>With Tarkanian's withdrawal and the decision by Chris McDaniel to switch from going after Roger Wicker to going after
whoever is appointed to fill the seat of the Sen. Thad Cochran (R-MS, who will resign from the Senate on April 1),
no Republican incumbent has a serious primary challenger. What a world of difference from the plan that former
White House strategist Steve Bannon had concocted. Bannon was going to arrange for a challenger for <i>every</i>
Republican Senate incumbent, but now he's out at Breitbart and is spending his time rubbing elbows with 
European right wingers. So, instead of every GOP senator facing a right-wing challenger, none will. (V)</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2018/Senate/Maps/Mar17.html#item-6"> Pennsylvania GOP Asks for Investigation </a> </h4>
<p>As expected, Pennsylvania's Republican Party has sent a letter
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/16/politics/pennsylvania-special-election-gop-investigation/index.html" target="_blank">requesting</a> 
that Pennsylvania Secretary of State Robert Torres conduct an investigation into
"a number of irregularities" in this week's election in PA-18. They have found
all sorts of things to quibble about, from improperly calibrated voting
machines, to unclear directions to polling places on the Secretary's website, to
voters not appearing on voter rolls. The GOP's concern about these matters is,
shall we say, a new development.</p>

<p>In the end, it's worth asking why the Party is bothering with this. At this
point, "the GOP lost a seat in a deep-red district" and "the GOP barely won a
seat in a deep-red district with the help of some legal maneuvering" are
effectively the same, PR-wise. And the district isn't going to exist in its
current form in November, so we're only talking about six months of actual
service in Congress. In any case, Pennsylvania law requires that three signed
affidavits, attesting to fraud or error, per precinct be submitted within five
days of the election for a recount. Presumably, the letter the Pennsylvania GOP
sent is a de facto acknowledgment that they are not going to be able to get the
affidavits together, and so are going to try an end run around the rules (backed
by the implied threat of a lawsuit). Given existing law, they probably won't get
anywhere. For what it is worth, the Secretaryship of State is an appointed,
officially non-partisan position in Pennsylvania. Torres was recently appointed
by Gov. Tom Wolf (D), which certainly suggests he's left-leaning, and at very
least allows us to be fairly confident that he's not going to work hard to tote
the GOP's water. That would not be true if he was, for example, Kansas Secretary
of State Kris Kobach (R). (Z)</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2018/Senate/Maps/Mar17.html#item-7"> Cook Moves Nine More Races Towards Democrats </a> </h4>
<p>In view of Conor Lamb's apparent victory in PA-18, the non-partisan Cook Political Report has 
<a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/378775-cook-political-report-moves-9-house-races-toward-dems" target="_blank">moved</a> 
another nine races in the direction of the blue team. Most notably the seats held by 
Reps. Leonard Lance (R-NJ), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), and Keith Rothfus (R-PA) are now all in the 
"toss-up" column. In total, Cook 
<a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings" target="_blank">has</a> 
73 Republican seats that it sees in play, as opposed to just 17 for the
Democrats. As a reminder, the Democrats need a net gain of 24 seats to retake
the House. If they were to split Cook's competitive races 50/50 with the GOP, they
would gain 28.</p>

<p>There are, of course, other ways to look at this question. For example, there
is the betting site PredictIt, where folks can invest real money in what they
think will happen in the elections. At the moment, "Democrats win the House" is
<a href="https://www.predictit.org/Browse/Group/79/House" target="_blank">selling</a> 
for 67 cents a share, and "Republicans keep the House" is selling for 35 cents a
share. That effectively equates to a 66% chance of the Democrats taking control.
More specifically, "investors" see a fair chance of the Dems picking up 24-30 seats
(roughly 15%), or 30-35 (15%), or 35-40 (10%), or 45-50 (5%), or 50-55 (5%), or
more than 55 (15%).</p>

<p>Still another way to look at it, one that will allow Democrats to sleep with
visions of sugarplums dancing in their heads, is to
<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/?ex_cid=rrpromo" target="_blank">consider</a> 
the "generic Democrat" vs. "generic Republican" polls. In the aggregate, they
suggest the blue team will outpoll the red team by 8 points in November. If that
were to happen, and the effect was uniform across the country, the Democrats
would pick up roughly 80 seats. This is a crude approach, as "generic
Republican" will not be on the ballot in most districts, an incumbent will. And,
the blue wave, if it happens, will not be distributed evenly across the country.
Nonetheless, any way one looks at it, the Democrats have to feel pretty good
about their chances in the midterms. (Z)</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2018/Senate/Maps/Mar17.html#item-8"> Louise Slaughter Dies </a> </h4>
<p>The oldest member of Congress, Louise Slaughter (D-NY), 
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-slaughter/louise-slaughter-longtime-progressive-new-york-congresswoman-dies-at-88-idUSKCN1GS1Z3" target="_blank">died</a>
yesterday at 88. She was born in Kentucky and
kept her Kentucky accent, even though she represented an upstate New York district in the House for over
30 years. Her death will force a special election to replace her. Her district has a PVI of D+8. In
recent special elections we have seen huge shifts leftward in Republican districts, so it should be
interesting to see if that also holds in a Democratic district. Maybe previously red districts
will start electing Democrats, and previously blue districts will start electing communists or
anarchists. (V)</p>
