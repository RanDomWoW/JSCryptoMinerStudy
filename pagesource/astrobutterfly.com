		<h3>New Moon in Pisces 17 March 2018</h3>
<p>We have a bittersweet <strong>New Moon in Pisces</strong> <strong>at 26° </strong>on Saturday, March 17<sup>th</sup> 2018.</p>
<p>The closest aspect the New Moon makes is a <strong>conjunction to</strong> <strong>Chiron,</strong> the wounded healer. Chiron has been in Pisces for 8 years now. Chiron will leave Pisces to move into Aries as of April 18<sup>th</sup> 2018.</p>
<p>We are now delving into the last lessons of Chiron in Pisces, and this lesson is particularly important, because the New Moon will bring it to the surface, whether we like it or not.</p>
<p>A New Moon is the magical moment when the two luminaries, the most important bodies in the sky &#8211; the Sun and the Moon &#8211; come together to start a new chapter, to write a new story.</p>
<p>We have a New Moon in Pisces only once in a year. Only once we are given the opportunity to delve into the waters of Pisces, to explore a whole universe, mysterious and neverending.</p>
<p>Pisces is the trickiest sign to describe &#8211; they are the chameleon of the zodiac.</p>
<p>Pisces absorb the energy around them. Whatever you are feeling, they are feeling too. And if you don&#8217;t feel a thing, they don&#8217;t either! Because they have a strange ability to become one with the world around them, Pisces can be everything or nothing.</p>

<h3>New Moon in Pisces is Conjunct Chiron, the Wounded Healer</h3>
<p>Pisces is the sign of the sacrifice.</p>
<p>In this regard, Pisces and Chiron have quite a bit in common.</p>
<p>Maybe you are familiar with the archetype of <strong>Chiron, the wounded healer</strong>.</p>
<p>The archetype comes from an episode from the famous Greek legend, when Hercules accidentally shoots Chiron with a poisonous arrow coated with the blood of Hydra.</p>
<p>Arrows coated with the blood of Hydra were known to cause painful wounds that would never heal. But because Chiron was immortal, he could never die. But he was also not able to heal.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Chiron in your natal chart <strong>shows that wound that never heals</strong>. Chiron&#8217;s wounds are not your fault, they are not the result of your bad actions. Chiron had to suffer simply because he was born immortal. Chiron is that wound you cannot do anything about.</p>
<p>But there is a twist to Chiron&#8217;s story. Ultimately, the Gods agree to release Chiron from suffering and let him die, by allowing him to replace Prometheus on the mountain Tartarus.</p>
<p>Upon his death, Chiron was released from his wound that would never heal and honored with the constellation of Centaurus, one of the largest constellations in the sky.</p>
<p>When Chiron gave up his immortality, ironically &#8211; he became immortal.</p>
<p>Your deepest wounds may never heal, but they eventually become <strong>your greatest gifts</strong>, your legacy, what you leave behind for generations to come.</p>
<p>By embracing your wounds, you allow them to become part of you, by owning them, they stop having power over you.</p>
<p>In Pisces, personal wounds become <strong>universal wounds</strong>. There is no more &#8220;my pain&#8221; or &#8220;your pain&#8221; but the pain we all share, the pain of the universe and all that dwells therein.</p>
<h3>Chiron in Pisces and the Illusion of Separation</h3>
<p>And the beauty of this is that in sharing the pain with the world, the <strong>illusion of separation</strong> disappears. In pain, as well as in love, there is no more &#8220;me&#8221;, there is no more &#8220;you&#8221;, there is only &#8220;us&#8221;.</p>
<p>Healing happens when you strip down the ego to become one with the world. Healing is being on the <strong>same wavelength as the universe</strong>.</p>
<p>When you meditate for example and focus on your breath, you are in fact aligning your natural rhythm (inhalation, exhalation) with the rhythm of the universe (expansion contraction).</p>
<p>Arts, dancing, listening to music are nothing else but our attempts to be on the same frequency with the universe. It is in that space of connectedness where your broken parts can come together, where healing is possible.</p>
<p>The New Moon in Pisces is about being together &#8211; in pain, in pleasure, in vitality, in sickness &#8211; caring about each other.</p>
<p>The New Moon in Pisces is not only conjunct Chiron, but also <strong>square Mars and trine Jupiter</strong>.</p>
<p>The square to Mars &#8211; who is now in the last degree of Sagittarius &#8211; is tough, and it hurts.</p>
<p>When something bleeds, it requires your immediate attention. Mars can tear apart your soul and your self-identification (you ego), but fortunately you are not left alone in this struggle.</p>
<p>Jupiter, the co-ruler of the New Moon, applies a beautiful trine aspect to the New Moon. There is hope after all. Healing will come, eventually.</p>
<h3>How to Heal the Chironic Wound</h3>
<p>Many of us have experienced the pain of separation during Chiron&#8217;s stay in Pisces. In the past 8 years, Chiron showed us <strong>where we find it difficult to connect with the world at large.</strong></p>
<p>The pain of separation is when no matter what you do, you cannot connect with the world, when no matter how hard you try, something inside of you is &#8220;off&#8221;.</p>
<p>Chiron in Pisces has been asking us to heal the wound of separation, by learning to be vulnerable, to trust others, to connect with the world from a place of authenticity and truth.</p>
<p>Pain can be healed if you immerse into it, if you let yourself go. Remember, separation is only an illusion.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been resisting the process, the New Moon in Pisces is your chance to make peace with your wound of separation.</p>
<p>If you have embraced your wound, the New Moon is the time to put it into use. How can you bring the awareness, the healing that came with it, to the next level?</p>
<p>Trent Reznor, the leadsinger of NIN (and a Chiron in Pisces native) captured beautifully the pain &#8211; and the bliss &#8211; of Chiron in Pisces.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;The farther I fall I&#8217;m beside you<br />
As lost as I get I will find you<br />
The deeper the wound I&#8217;m inside you<br />
For ever and ever I&#8217;m a part of</em></p>
<p><em>You and me<br />
We&#8217;re in this together now<br />
We will make it through somehow<br />
You and me<br />
If the world should break in two<br />
Until the very end of me<br />
Until the very end of you</em></p>
<p>NIN – We&#8217;re in this together</p></blockquote>
<h3>How the New Moon in Pisces Will Affect You</h3>
<p>You will feel the energy of the New Moon stronger if you have planets between 26°-29° in mutable signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces).</p>
<p>The energy of the New Moon will feel familiar to you if Chiron plays an important role in you natal chart (is conjunct Sun, Moon or chart ruler).</p>
<p>Have a look in which house in your natal chart the New Moon takes place to see which area of your life needs healing.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
		<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;">On March 4<sup>th</sup> we have a rare alignment: <strong>Mercury, Venus and Chiron</strong> meet up at 27° Pisces. On the same day, just few hours earlier, we have another exact alignment: Sun conjunct Neptune at 13° Pisces.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a lot of Piscean energy to deal with. Let&#8217;s go back for a moment to the symbolism of Pisces. The Pisces symbol is two fish tied together by a rope. Yet, the two fish swim (or at least, try to swim) in completely different directions – one swimming toward individuality, and the other towards universality.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;">Pisces is the last sign of the zodiac, a symbol for a journey that has come to an end. At the crossroads, we have two choices: to go back into the material realm and restart the cycle or incarnations, or to leave behind the material realm to become one with the spirit.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;">Pisces does not give us the answer to this struggle, it simply depicts the struggle of having one foot in the &#8216;real&#8217; world and the other in the invisible world. Wherever you have Pisces in your natal chart, that is a place of restlessness and ambivalence.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Now let&#8217;s have a closer look at the triple conjunction &#8211; Venus, Mercury and Chiron at 27° Pisces.</strong></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;">Triple conjunctions (three planets lined up at the same degree of the zodiac) are very rare and therefore highly significant. What makes this conjunction special is the link to Chiron. Chiron will move in Aries on April 17<sup>th</sup> so this is the last time Chiron meets up with Venus and Mercury in the last sign of the zodiac for the next 50 years.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;">The &#8216;key&#8217; to understanding this triple conjunction is Chiron itself. Mercury and Venus are personal planets and they are much more accessible to us.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Mercury</strong> represents our mind, how we make sense of the world around us, how we communicate with others, how we express ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Venus</strong> represents how we relate to others, how we make connections with the outside world. If Mercury is concerned strictly with exchange of information, Venus wants to make something valuable with this information – to establish exchanges, to negotiate, to give and take.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;">That&#8217;s why Venus is not only connected to love and beauty, but also with money and possessions. Venus is our unit of value exchange.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, Mercury and Venus coming together are concerned with exchange of information (Mercury) about what we value, about what is important to us (Venus).</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Chiron</strong> is a different &#8216;animal&#8217; altogether and probably the most cryptic astrological significator in one&#8217;s chart. While Uranus, Neptune and Pluto (the transpersonal planets) are even more enigmatic than Chiron, they are completely inaccessible to us. Chiron comes with the potential to be – at least to a certain extent – grasped within the limitations of the human mind.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;">To understand the nature of Chiron we need to keep in mind that <strong>Chiron orbits between Saturn and Uranus</strong>. Saturn is the most material planet, the last planet visible with a naked eye. Saturn represents the highest form of our &#8216;mortal&#8217; existence.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;">Uranus on the other hand is on a higher order. Uranus breaks free from the limitations of the material world – Uranus represents liberation from the chains of what is holding us down here on Earth.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;">Chiron is therefore KEY, the link between the world as we know and the higher realm of consciousness.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Chiron rules our DNA</strong>, which is nothing more than the &#8216;code&#8217; passed down from one generation to another. This code represents that part of us that never dies, that information that cannot be destroyed. When nothing else is left of our bodies, we still live through our children, a part of us is still manifesting and unfolding with each coming generation.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;">The reason we keep on passing on a part of ourselves is to bring the potential of our human existence to the highest possible form of manifestation. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;">And that&#8217;s why Chiron is connected to the concept of Gifts. Only the strongest sequences or our DNA are passed on to the next generations, so they can become stronger and stronger, and come closer and closer to &#8216;perfection&#8217;.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;">But until we learn how to integrate this genetic information that has been passed on to us and to bring it to a higher order of manifestation (the Uranian side of Chiron), Chironian gifts can feel like wounds.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;">The enigmatic &#8220;Las Meninas&#8221; by Velazquez is one of the most important paintings of the all time.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img data-attachment-id="3886" data-permalink="https://astrobutterfly.com/2018/03/04/triple-conjunction-mercury-venus-chiron-in-pisces-invisible-ties/las_meninas_by_diego_velazquez-chiron/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/astrobutterfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Las_Meninas_by_Diego_Velázquez-Chiron.jpg?fit=800%2C921&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="800,921" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Las_Meninas,_by_Diego_Velázquez Chiron" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/astrobutterfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Las_Meninas_by_Diego_Velázquez-Chiron.jpg?fit=261%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/astrobutterfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Las_Meninas_by_Diego_Velázquez-Chiron.jpg?fit=800%2C921&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3886" src="https://i0.wp.com/astrobutterfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Las_Meninas_by_Diego_Velázquez-Chiron.jpg?resize=800%2C921&#038;ssl=1" alt="Las_Meninas,_by_Diego_Velázquez Chiron" width="800" height="921" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/astrobutterfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Las_Meninas_by_Diego_Velázquez-Chiron.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/astrobutterfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Las_Meninas_by_Diego_Velázquez-Chiron.jpg?resize=261%2C300&amp;ssl=1 261w, https://i0.wp.com/astrobutterfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Las_Meninas_by_Diego_Velázquez-Chiron.jpg?resize=768%2C884&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/astrobutterfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Las_Meninas_by_Diego_Velázquez-Chiron.jpg?resize=416%2C479&amp;ssl=1 416w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;">The painting depicts a scene from the Spanish court of king Philip IV. The young princess in the center of the scene is Infanta Margaret, the daughter of the king and queen of Spain and the heiress to the throne. Apparently, the whole scene and all the characters revolve around the little princess.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;">If we look more closely however, we notice a painting in the background of the scene showing the king and the queen of Spain who are the little princess&#8217; parents. If we take an even closer look, we notice that this is not a painting, but a mirror. The mirror in fact shows a reflection from the painting Velazquez (the painter in the left side) is working on. He is actually painting the royal couple!</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;">The main character of the scene is not Infanta Margaret anymore, but her parents. The royal couple is posing in front of the scene as Velazques paints them, while their daughter and several other characters watch. The painting therefore shows their view of the scene. Of the nine figures depicted, five are looking directly out at the royal couple. Their glances which seek for approval, affirm the royal couple&#8217;s presence and potency. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;">The painting was commissioned by the king himself. He chose not to have himself or the queen painted. At least at the first sight, they are missing from the artwork. However, if we dig deeper and understand the cryptic composition of the scene, we understand that they are the ones in the center of everything. Their power is unquestionable. Their power is what gives everything meaning.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;">But again, the painting says more than that. Although the royal couple&#8217;s power is unquestionable, they are merely a reflection in the mirror. The future is in front of them. Infanta Margaret, the future Queen of Spain, will pass on their power to the next generations. Infanta is still a child, and although she doesn&#8217;t have yet any real authority, she has the promise of power encoded in her genes.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;">The triple conjunction between Mercury, Venus and Chiron will give us &#8216;access&#8217; to one of our gifts. As we described earlier, Mercury and Venus are accessible planets. They will bring to our awareness Chiron&#8217;s otherwise cryptic information.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;">Just as Las Meninas becomes more and more accessible to us as we look at it, some highly important pieces of information about who we are, and what we are meant to become in this lifetime, will be revealed to us.</span></p>

		<p>March is a very intense month: we have<strong> two Full Moons</strong>, a <a href="https://astrobutterfly.com/2018/03/04/triple-conjunction-mercury-venus-chiron-in-pisces-invisible-ties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>triple conjunction</strong> <strong>between Venus, Mercury and Chiron</strong></a>, and two planets – Mercury and Jupiter &#8211; <strong>stationing retrograde.</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a room full of Aries people. There are some other signs out there as well, but Aries definitely outnumbers everyone. Ah -and there is no single Aquarian in the room.</p>
<p>This is what March is going to feel like – we have a <strong>lot of fire and cardinal</strong> energy, and almost no air and fixed energy. This translates into tons of passion and energy, at the expense of reason and objective, long term thinking.</p>
<p>This means that in March your desire to start new things, to embark in new adventures, to do what it feels right for YOU is stronger than ever. As long as you genuinely tap into your deepest longings and desires, you are going to do well. March is a good time to start solo projects as opposed to teamwork or collaborations.</p>

<p>March starts with a beautiful <a href="https://astrobutterfly.com/2018/02/26/full-moon-in-virgo-a-bridge-from-heaven-to-earth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Full Moon at 11° Virgo.</strong></a> This Full Moon is highly romantic and will bring optimism, inspiration and creative ideas. Allow yourself to go with the flow and indulge in whatever it is that you love. Some opportunities that come to you may seem too good to be true! But consider that maybe – just maybe – this is your lucky day.</p>
<p><strong>March 4</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup> is one of the most important days of the year. By definition, whenever we have conjunctions, things start to precipitate, and events happen. On March 4<sup>th</sup> we have a record of 5 planets merging energies: Sun is conjunct Neptune at 13° Pisces and <strong><a href="https://astrobutterfly.com/2018/03/04/triple-conjunction-mercury-venus-chiron-in-pisces-invisible-ties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercury, Venus and Chiron all line up at 27° Pisces</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Something important will happen to you today – look up in which house you have Pisces to see what you can expect. No matter which area of your life comes into focus, March 4<sup>th</sup> will bring a sense of healing and closure.</p>
<p>Philosophically, the truth is to be found where there is a closure of conscious awareness regarding several elements. Truth &#8217;emerges&#8217; when several conditions fit together coherently and make sense as a whole. We know we have found the truth when there is no more gap in knowledge, when a deeper knowledge emerges by fitting all the elements together in the right order and relationship.</p>
<p>In the same way, some broken, some disparate, dissociated parts of yourself can finally come together and fit like a puzzle. In March 4<sup>th</sup> you can have a profound <em>a-ha </em>moment about who you are and what is the meaning of your existence. Something will finally make sense to you.</p>
<p>On <strong>March 6</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup> Mercury enters Aries. Our mind will become more alert, and our decision-making process will become faster. Just make sure you make those big decisions in the first 22 days of the month, because on March 23<sup>rd</sup> Mercury goes retrograde.</p>
<p>On <strong>March 8</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup> Jupiter is the first planet to break the spell of the &#8216;almost three months with no retrograde planets&#8217; period. Jupiter goes retrograde at 23° Scorpio &#8211; look if you have any sensitive point in your chart around this degree because if so, you are going to experience this energy stronger.</p>
<p>Whenever Jupiter changes sign or direction, something &#8216;big&#8217; happens. Remember when Jupiter entered Scorpio and the Harvey Weinstein scandal erupted in the media? Around March 8<sup>th</sup> we can expect similar big scale (Jupiter) disclosures (Scoprio).</p>
<p>Look at which area of your natal chart is currently transited by Jupiter – some information related to that topic will come to your attention around March 8<sup>th</sup>. Now is time to make some adjustments or &#8216;dig deeper&#8217; into this particular area of your life.</p>
<p>On<strong> March 17</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup> Mars enters Capricorn. This is good news and bad news. The good news is that Mars is in exaltation in Capricorn, which means he feels good here. Mars in Capricorn is brave, bold, militaristic, determined and hard working. Even the laziest of us will find it easier than usual to bring projects to completion in the next two months.</p>
<p>The bad news is that Mars is joining Saturn and Pluto in Capricorn – Saturn and Pluto are not by any means easy going planets. Mars will most likely want to ignite what Saturn and Pluto have been concocting since December last year, so you can expect some very intense events and experiences in the area of your life where you have Capricorn.</p>
<p>On <strong>March 18</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup> Sun is conjunct Chiron at 28° Pisces. This is your opportunity to connect with your inner shaman. You don&#8217;t have to be a healer or therapist to embrace the shaman inside you. The shaman is that part of you which can connect effortlessly with nature on all its fronts.</p>
<p>This is the last time we have this conjunction in Pisces – next year the conjunction will take place in Aries, and the next Sun Chiron conjunction will take place 50 years from now! Today is your final chance to embrace a part of yourself you don&#8217;t feel naturally comfortable with. Because this aspect takes place right at the end of the zodiac, it will likely bring a completion of some sort.</p>
<p>On <strong>March 19</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup> Mercury is conjunct Venus at 16° Aries. This is a good day for communication or verbal expression of any kind. If you have a presentation or a performance today, you are going to be more at ease than usual with your creative expression. Conjunctions in general bring new opportunities so if you have planets or angles around 16° Aries an interesting opportunity can knock at your door.</p>
<p>On <strong>March 20</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup> the Sun enters Aries and a new Solar year begins. The New Solar year, or the Equinox takes place at 0° Aries. This is undoubtedly the most potent degree of the zodiac, because this is where the zodiac starts! Anything is possible right now &#8211; at 0° we can start afresh, with no strings attached. If the rest of your natal chart further supports it, now is the best time to start something new.</p>
<p>On <strong>March 23</strong><sup><strong>rd</strong></sup> Venus at 21° Aries is square Pluto at 21° Capricorn. This transit is going to be intense! Venus and Pluto are known to bring obsession, jealousy but also tons of passion. The key to navigating Pluto transits is not to try to &#8216;control&#8217; the events in the external world. If you can do that, you will most likely be able to enjoy the passion and the dramatism of this transit, if not, Venus square Pluto can bring you pain and frustration.</p>
<p>In the same day, <strong>Mercury goes retrograde at 16° Aries</strong>. As always, avoid stating big projects today, unless you want them to change their course later. If you are bored and you consider breaking up the routine, going on an adventure trip when Mercury goes retrograde can be a great idea! But if this is not what you are necessarily looking for, best to postpone important projects for a few more days at least, or even better, until Mercury goes direct in mid-April.</p>
<p>On <strong>March 28</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup> Venus is conjunct Uranus at 27° Aries. Venus and Uranus will aspect each other more than ever this year, especially in October / November when retrograde Venus will spend an unusual amount of time in an opposition to Uranus. If you have planets or angles in the last degrees of Libra or Aries you can expect a lot of surprises this year in the area of relationships.</p>
<p>March ends on the same spectacular note it had begun, with a 2<sup>nd</sup> Full Moon. The Full Moon on <strong>March 31</strong><sup><strong>st</strong></sup> is at 10° Libra. This Full Moon is much more challenging than the Full Moon we had on March 1<sup>st</sup>, because it is engaged in a T-square with Mars and Saturn in Capricorn.</p>
<p>Mars and Capricorn are known as the &#8216;malefics&#8217; in traditional astrology, and it doesn&#8217;t help that the two &#8216;bad guys of the zodiac&#8217; join forces at this powerful time of manifestation. What it does help is that Mars and Saturn are in Capricorn, and both planets feel good in this sign (Saturn is in domicile in Capricorn and Mars is in exaltation).</p>
<p>This means that right now they will most likely show their positive qualities. Mars and Saturn are very determined and efficient in Capricorn so you can expect to get a lot done at the time of the Full Moon (not without effort and obstacles, though). Venus, the ruler of the Full Moon enters its domicile, Taurus, just before the Full Moon so this is another positive aspect that will mitigate the effects of this dramatic Full Moon.</p>
<p>If you have planets or angles around 10° in Cardinal signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn) or around 0° Taurus, you can expect important changes in your life. To see what area of your life will come into focus look in which house you have Libra and Taurus. If you have Aries ascendant for example, the areas of focus will be your relationships (Libra in the 7<sup>th</sup> house) and your finances (Taurus in your 2<sup>nd</sup> house).</p>

		<p>The first <strong>Full Moon</strong> of March (yes, we have two Full Moons this month!) happens Thursday, <strong>March 1<sup>st</sup> at 11° Virgo</strong>.</p>
<p>Although Virgo is not necessarily the most romantic sign of the zodiac, this particular Full Moon is all about love. That&#8217;s because the <strong>Moon is opposite Neptune</strong>, the planet of higher love and ideals, and because the ruler of the Full Moon, <strong>Mercury, is conjunct Venus</strong>, the goddess of love and beauty.</p>

<p>Venus and Mercury form a beautiful <strong>trine to Jupiter</strong>. When Venus and Jupiter, the most auspicious planets come together to form a positive aspect, the world finally becomes a better place to live in.</p>
<p>Right now we also have a stellium of planets in Pisces, the most sensitive and psychic sign of the zodiac.</p>
<p>All these configurations promise a rare Full Moon, infused with the frequencies of love, connection and compassion. Even if you are not in a romantic relationship, even if now, love in any form is missing from your life, you will become more sensitive to these vibrations. You can literally feel that love is all around, if you allow yourself to swim in its wavy waters:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I feel it in my fingers/</em></p>
<p><em>I feel it in my toes/</em></p>
<p><em>The love that&#8217;s all around me/</em></p>
<p><em>And so the feeling grows/</em></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s written on the wind/</em></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s everywhere I go&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, the Full Moon won&#8217;t be only about dreaming about love and hiding away from a &#8216;less ideal&#8217; reality. The Moon will also make a practical trine to Saturn, making sure we keep reality in check.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s not forget that the Full Moon is in Virgo, and we all know that Virgo is responsible, practical and likes to get the work done before play.</p>
<p>Virgo&#8217;s love is dependable. For a Virgo, love is not only about butterflies in the stomach. Virgo takes care for the object of its love.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;You know I love you, I always will/</em></p>
<p><em>My mind&#8217;s made up by the way that I feel/</em></p>
<p><em>There&#8217;s no beginning, there&#8217;ll be no end/</em></p>
<p><em>&#8216;Cause on my love you can depend&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Virgo / Pisces</strong> is one of the two mutable axis (the other one is Gemini / Sagittarius). Mutable signs are the most flexible and perceptive signs of the zodiac. No other sign can adjust to new circumstances better than mutable signs do!</p>
<p>While Gemini and Sagittarius represent the Yang Mutable axis (this means they prefer to initiate change), <strong>Virgo ans Pisces represent the Yin mutable axis</strong>, which means they prefer to respond and adapt to change.</p>
<p>Virgo will adapt by finding practical ways to get around circumstances, and Pisces will adapt to them, by tuning into their emotions. Even if Virgo and Pisces moan and complain, no matter how tough life gets, they are better equipped than other signs to not only survive, but also to thrive in adversity.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is nothing negative for anyone to adjust to this time. Ironically, sometimes what we need to adjust to, is the Good. <strong>And adjusting to the Good can be just as difficult as adjusting to the Bad.</strong></p>
<p>If good things start happening to you and you find yourself asking &#8220;Is this too good to be true?&#8221; just be aware that this might be your natural resistance to change. Especially if you have a lot of fixed energy in your chart, you might find it difficult to relax and believe that some things are indeed good for you.</p>
<p>Pisces is ruled by Neptune and Jupiter – Neptune is about our highest ideals and dreams, and Jupiter is about keeping the faith. Sometimes all you need to do is BELIEVE – believe that life is good, believe that you can have a little bit of magic in your life, believe that miracles are possible.</p>
<p>Triggered by the Moon, the <strong>stellium in Pisces</strong> becomes the central stage of manifestation of this powerful lunation. Right now there are 5 planets in Pisces. We have the <strong>Sun</strong>, our individual consciousness. Next to the Sun sits <strong>Neptune</strong>, our longing to merge with something larger than ourselves.</p>
<p>Next comes <strong>Mercury,</strong> which represents our mind, how we – rationally &#8211; make sense of what is going on around us. Closely by sits <strong>Venus</strong>, which represents how we relate to others.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we have <strong>Chiron</strong> which represents our DNA &#8211; our gifts, as well as our wounds. These wounds and gifts have been passed down to us from generation to generation to be transcended, so that we – and what we leave behind – can become an even greater masterpiece, and achieve our highest potential possible.</p>
<p>On the other side of the Pisces stellium, the <strong>Moon in Virgo will act like a bridge</strong>, bringing together the rarefied realm of higher consciousness (Pisces) with the abiding possibilities of nature (Virgo).</p>
<p>And just like the Virgo Moon makes the impossible possible, turns the immaterial into material, creates concrete results out of mere ethereal ideas, right now, you can bring a little bit of Heaven on Earth. Or even better, you can look for and recognize that a little bit of Heaven is already in everyone and everything around you.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Love breaks down borders; it would even bridge the border between</em></p>
<p><em>heaven and earth that God may see our face in consecration.</em></p>
<p><em>So what gap now is so wide that love cannot bridge?</em></p>
<p><em>For it is not one which heaven has erected,</em></p>
<p><em>But it arises from a lack of understanding of the power of love, and</em></p>
<p><em>it is one&#8217;s understanding of love that needs to be perfected</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Edward Hays</p></blockquote>
<p>The sabian symbol of the Full Moon in Virgo is <strong>&#8220;A bride with her veil snatched away&#8221;</strong> symbolizing full disclosure of what has been kept secret, as well as full appreciation of beauty and purity.</p>
<p>After the wedding ceremony, the groom lifts the veil to symbolically consummate the marriage. Nature resists only to be subdued by the power that transcends her, and while being transcended, nature becomes mystery and spirit in action.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Full Moon in Virgo will ask us to pierce through the veil, and see the beauty that has always been there for us, waiting to be unveiled, waiting to be appreciated, waiting to be consumed.</p>

		<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">On 15</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><sup><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">th</span></sup></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> of February 2018 we have a powerful Solar Eclipse in Aquarius.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The Solar Eclipse completes the Eclipse window that began with the Lunar Eclipse on January 31</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><sup><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">st</span></sup></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, bringing to culmination whatever you put into motion two weeks ago.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">A Solar Eclipse sees the light of the Sun obscured by the Moon. We are used to seeing the Sun rise and set every day, in an uninterrupted pattern. When its light is obscured, the usual pattern is interrupted. In this way, an Eclipse acts as an interruption of &#8216;business as usual&#8217;, of the regular routine in your life.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">There are four types of eclipses: Lunar North Node Eclipses (like the one we had on January 31</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><sup><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">st</span></sup></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> 2018), Lunar South Node Eclipses, Solar North Node Eclipses (like the one we had on August 21</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><sup><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">st</span></sup></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> 2017 – the great American Eclipse) and Solar South Node Eclipses. The Eclipse on February 15</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><sup><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">th</span></sup></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> is a </span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><b>Solar South Node Eclipse.</b></span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">If Lunar Eclipses bring our emotions forward, Solar Eclipses are about our consciousness, about what we accept as true, how we define ourselves. The Sun represents our deep self, the essence of our personality, the unique expression of our being. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">If North Node Eclipses are about welcoming new experiences, South Node Eclipses are about releasing or letting go of whatever does not serve our higher purpose.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Therefore, the </span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><b>Solar Eclipse on February 15</b></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><sup><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><b>th</b></span></sup></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><b> is about letting go of some old identifications of the Self</b></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, which feed on our energy and pull us down.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The Eclipse takes place at 27° Aquarius and is conjunct Mercury (information, communication) and Juno (devotion), is sextile Uranus (surprises, freedom) and square Jupiter (growth, long-term plans).</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><b>The theme of the Solar Eclipse is re-assessment of commitments. </b></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">If you want to achieve your long-term plans (Jupiter) you may need to make some changes (Uranus) in your commitments (Juno).</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Now is a good time to have truthful discussions (Mercury) with full disclosure of your expectations. Because this is a South Node Eclipse, be open to let go of some of your own beliefs, of what you accept as true. Change starts with you!</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The traditional ruler of the Eclipse, Saturn, is in domicile in Capricorn and is applying a sextile to Venus, which is now in exaltation in Pisces. This is a highly supportive aspect bringing common sense and clarity. If you want to fix something, no need to overdo-it and complicate things. Sometimes, the biggest transformations come from changing one small thing.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The Solar Eclipse takes place in Aquarius, but as with every eclipse, the opposite sign, Leo, is activated as well. Leo is the self, the individual. Aquarius, on the other hand, is the group.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The Leo–Aquarius axis highlights the relationship between the individual and the collective, self-interest vs. shared purpose, making it on your own versus getting help from others.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The Solar eclipse on February 15</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><sup><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">th</span></sup></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> will ask you to examine where you get lost in the group (South Node in Aquarius) and where you hold back from being your true self (North Node in Leo).</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="color: #000000;">“<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><b>Me, We”</b></span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Muhammad Ali is known as one of the greatest boxers ever. But not many people know that Muhammad Ali has invented the shortest poem in the English language. When talking to 2000 Harvard seniors at a commencement ceremony in 1975, Ali came up with what is thought to be the shortest poem:</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">&#8220;Me</span></span></span></span></p>

<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Sometimes, the poem is asserted as:</span></span></span></span></p>

<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The first version expresses a sense of community, of support and togetherness (Aquarius).</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The other expresses a carefree attitude, of enjoyment for one&#8217;s achievements and abilities and gratitude for the opportunity of existence (Leo).</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">This is a South Node Eclipse, so the Aquarius principle of defining ourselves though others is challenged by the need of authentic self-expression.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The Solar Eclipse is an invitation to honor yourself for who you are. Other people&#8217;s expectations, societal norms are indeed necessary, as we don&#8217;t live alone in this world, but in the same time, they do not define us.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">You are who you are and you are perfect that way.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The Solar Eclipse in Aquarius will ask you to let go of the need to fit in. And the paradox and beauty of it, is that by not fitting in, you stand out.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The Solar Eclipse takes place at 27° Aquarius, opposite the </span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">August 21</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><sup><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">st</span></span></sup></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> 2017 Solar eclipse at 28° Leo. </span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Thus, this eclipse can bring to completion themes and projects from last summer / early fall.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">If nothing specific happened in your life last summer, go back in time. Eclipses are cyclical, triggering the same degrees every 18 years. What was your experience of the Aquarius Solar Eclipses in February 1999, 1980 and 1961?</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">If you have natal planets or angles (Ascendant, Descendant, Midheaven and IC) around 25°-29° in Leo or Aquarius you are going to feel the energy of this Eclipse more intensely. Planets in late degrees of the other fixed signs (Taurus, and Scorpio) are also vulnerable.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Even if the Eclipse doesn&#8217;t trigger sensitive points in your chart, you are still going to experience the energy of the Eclipse in a certain sector of your life. This is the house where you have Aquarius in your natal chart.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">If for example you have Capricorn ascendant, the Eclipse will fall in your 2</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><sup><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">nd</span></sup></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> house (Aquarius is the 2</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><sup><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">nd</span></sup></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> sign from Capricorn) which means that your finances and possessions will come into focus. If you don&#8217;t know in which house you have Aquarius, here is a guide on how to calculate it yourself </span></span><a href="https://astrobutterfly.com/2017/09/25/how-to-read-transits-in-your-natal-chart-step-by-step-instructions/"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">https://astrobutterfly.com/2017/09/25/how-to-read-transits-in-your-natal-chart-step-by-step-instructions/</span></span></a> </span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">You may not experience the effect of the Eclipse immediately. An Eclipse has a time span of 6 months, so certain themes can start to unfold at a later stage. After the 6-month window passes, you will be able to have a deeper sense of awareness and have more control of the affairs of the house where you have Aquarius.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">You can make the best out of this Eclipse by consciously letting go of your attachments to an expected outcome. Instead, surrender to what is real within you, to your own natural rhythm. You may discover you&#8217;ve been out of touch with it for a very long time.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><b>Ritual for the Solar Eclipse</b></span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">After you have identified in which house in your natal chart the Eclipse falls, write down on a piece of paper all the blockages, outdated beliefs, self-sabotaging behaviors that undermine you in these specific area of your life.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">After you have finished writing, burn the piece of paper. Make sure you perform the ritual in a ventilated place, preferably outside, where you can easily put down the fire if needed.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="m_-6680642343337496123gmail-western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Although we won&#8217;t have any Full Moon this month, February will not be by any means be less eventful than January.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="m_-6680642343337496123gmail-western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">February is marked by a very powerful <b><a href="https://astrobutterfly.com/2018/02/15/solar-eclipse-in-aquarius-me-we/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">New Moon in Aquarius which is also a Solar Eclipse</span></a>.</b> This Solar Eclipse will be the trademark of February and events will tend to happen around this time. If you are born around 15<sup>th</sup> of February, the coming year is going to be a very important year of your life.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The New Moon and Solar Eclipse in Aquarius coincides with the start of the Chinese year of the Earth Dog. In Chinese tradition, </span><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Earth dogs are faithful, considerate and well-disciplined. This is pretty much what we can expect from 2018 from a Western perspective as well, having Saturn in hard-working Capricorn and Jupiter in truthful Scorpio. The year of the Earth Dog is supposed to be auspicious in financial matters, but also exhausting on a physical level.</span></span></p>
<p class="m_-6680642343337496123gmail-western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Also around Mid February, depending where you are on Earth, <strong>Venus makes her appearance as an evening star</strong> (this phenomenon is called Venus&#8217; heliacal rising). Venus has been away for a long time and because of that many people have experienced a difficult time in love and relationships.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="m_-6680642343337496123gmail-western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Venus invisible is even more problematic than Venus retrograde. If Venus retrograde can bring issues to the surface, but also resolutions to these issues, Venus invisible means that the values Venus stands for (love, relationships, values, possessions) become &#8216;invisible&#8217;, and are literally missing from our life. Venus has been lost in the glare of the Sun for approximately 2 months so we will all rejoice when Venus will make her appearance in the evening sky. You will especially benefit from Venus&#8217; heliacal rising if you have Aries, Taurus, Libra or Scorpio Ascendant.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="m_-6680642343337496123gmail-western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">All these events make mid-February an extremely eventful time. If you have planned activities around this date expect very interesting developments.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="m_-6680642343337496123gmail-western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;">On </span><span style="color: #000000;"><b>February 3</b></span><span style="color: #000000;"><sup><b>rd</b></sup></span><span style="color: #000000;"><b> </b></span><span style="color: #000000;">Sun is conjunct the South Node of the Moon and Venus is square Jupiter. Venus square Jupiter is a very idealistic and optimistic combination – we will feel the sky&#8217;s the limit! On the other hand, Sun conjunct the South Node has the opposite effect. Sun conjunct the South Node is a reality check: yes, in theory anything in possible, but in practice, we all have limited time and resources and not everything is for everyone. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="m_-6680642343337496123gmail-western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;">South Node is Karma knocking on our door: is this thing you are doing serving your higher purpose, or is just wasting your time? What seems to be too good to be true can be not that good in the end. <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1081877068"><span class="aQJ">February 3</span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>rd</sup></span><span style="color: #000000;"> is not the best day to make big changes or to try to fix something. It is not about trying harder, it is about releasing and letting go.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="m_-6680642343337496123gmail-western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On <b>February 10</b><sup><b>th</b></sup><b> </b><a href="https://astrobutterfly.com/2017/01/04/venus-in-pisces-the-mermaid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Venus enters Pisces</strong></span></a>. The Goddess of beauty and love, Venus moves into her exaltation sign inviting all of us to feel what love is really about: losing yourself into the oneness of the universe, into the flow of everything. We will all benefit from this energy, and if you have Venus in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) you will benefit even more so.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="m_-6680642343337496123gmail-western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On <b>February 13</b><sup><b>th</b></sup><b> </b>Mercury in Aquarius is square Jupiter in Scorpio. This is a tense combination because it takes place in fixed signs – and fixed signs like to stick to their point of view. Mercury, representing our individual experience of the world, feels cool and detached in Aquarius. Jupiter, which represents our social experience of the world, feels deep and penetrative in Scorpio. You can have a clash between your objective and your subjective experience of the world. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="m_-6680642343337496123gmail-western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Mercury square Jupiter will test you and show you there is no right or wrong answer. We need both rationality and intuition to fully, deeply understand something. But again, because the square is in fixed signs, you can have a hard time to reconcile the two. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="m_-6680642343337496123gmail-western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On <strong>February 15th</strong> we have a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://astrobutterfly.com/2018/02/15/solar-eclipse-in-aquarius-me-we/">New Moon and Solar Eclipse at 27° Aquarius</a></strong></span>. The eclipse is tightly conjunct Mercury and Juno, i</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #222222;">s square Jupiter and sextile Uranus. The ruler of the Eclipse, Saturn, is sextile Venus. Venus with Saturn, as well as the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://astrobutterfly.com/2017/05/28/juno-undying-devotion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asteroid Juno are connected to the principle of devotion.</a></strong></span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="m_-6680642343337496123gmail-western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #222222;">This is a South Node eclipse – South Node eclipses are about letting go. Both Lunar Nodes are about adjustments, and alignments &#8211; if North Node eclipses have a dose of mystery and unknown, South Node eclipses are more literal – the adjustments they require are more obvious. You may have been devoting all your life to a cause, to a dream, to an </span><span style="color: #000000;">ideal (Aquarius). The eclipse will expose the current reality of that ideal. You may realize that you are devoted to a lost cause, or at least, your cause and the relationship you have with it needs to go through some changes.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="m_-6680642343337496123gmail-western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;">To find out how the Eclipse is going to impact you, check which house of your natal chart Aquarius is in. If you have for example, Scorpio ascendant / Aquarius in the 4</span><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>th</sup></span><span style="color: #000000;"> house, you may realize that you have put too much energy and devotion into your family to the point of losing yourself. There are many people who stay in current jobs, relationships, friendships out of devotion, even if they are unhappy. The Solar Eclipse in Aquarius will challenge your relationship with the concept of devotion. Is it really worth it? Is your devotion unconditional or do you expect something in return? Venus sextile Saturn will give you the pragmatism to make the necessary changes.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="m_-6680642343337496123gmail-western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On <b>February 17</b><sup><b>th</b></sup> <b>– February 18</b><sup><b>th</b></sup><b> </b>Mars in Sagittarius is square Neptune in Pisces and Mercury and the Sun enter Pisces. You may feel uncertain about what is the best course of action. Should you assert yourself or go with the flow? On 17<sup>th</sup> &#8211; 18<sup>th</sup> of February we have a stellium in Pisces: Sun, Mercury, Venus, Neptune, Moon and Chiron, inviting you to swim in the waters of your intuition. Deep inside, you know what you need to do. The affairs of the house where you have Pisces will come into focus.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="m_-6680642343337496123gmail-western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On <b>February 21</b><sup><b>st</b></sup><b> </b>Venus is conjunct Neptune. This aspect signifies nothing more, nothing less but pure love. Venus is exalted in Pisces and Neptune is in domicile in Pisces. Pisces stands for unconditional love and compassion. No matter how pragmatic you are, today you will feel drawn to beauty and love in its purest form. If you go on a romantic date on February 21<sup>st</sup>, it is going to be wonderful. Embrace this energy with your heart open and with no expectations.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="m_-6680642343337496123gmail-western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Between <b>February 25</b><sup><b>th</b></sup> <b>– February 28</b><sup><b>th</b></sup><b> </b>Venus and Mercury square Mars and Mercury is conjunct Neptune. These aspects can increase the intensity in relationships, for good and for bad. Your desire to connect with others, not only on a spiritual level, but also on a physical level, increases. In the midst of Neptunian fog, let go of your fears and expectations and surrender to the unknown.</span></span></span></p>

		<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On 31</span><sup><span style="font-size: medium;">st</span></sup><span style="font-size: medium;"> of January we have a very powerful </span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Full Moon and Total Lunar Eclipse at 11° Leo</b></span><span style="font-size: medium;">. The Eclipse is visible in Australia, New Zealand, South East Asia, </span><span style="font-size: medium;">Alaska, Hawaii and north-western Canada. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On Wednesday night, the </span><span style="font-size: medium;">Moon will pass </span><span style="font-size: medium;">directly behind the Earth, disappearing into its shadow. </span>This shadow is what the astrologers call the <b>North Node</b>, a karmic power point that represents the Soul&#8217;s evolutionary direction in this lifetime. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The Eclipses happen when the Sun or the Moon align with the North Node or the South Node, which are nothing else but the orbital nodes of the Moon – the North Node is where the Moon crosses from south of the ecliptic to the north of the ecliptic, and the South Node is where it crosses from north of the ecliptic to south of the ecliptic. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Because this alignment happens only at the New Moon and Full Moon phase, we can have either an Eclipse of the Sun (at the New Moon phase) or an Eclipse of the Moon (at the Full Moon phase)</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">So we can have 4 types of eclipses: South Node Solar Eclipses, South Node Lunar Eclipses, North Node Solar Eclipses and North Node Lunar Eclipses.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The Lunar Eclipse on 31</span><sup><span style="font-size: medium;">st</span></sup><span style="font-size: medium;"> of January 2018 is a </span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>North Node Lunar Eclipse.</b></span><span style="font-size: medium;"> This means it is concerned with the Feminine principle (the Moon) and with the future (North Node).</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">While the South Node eclipses are about releasing of the past, the </span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>North Node eclipses require adjustment to new circumstances.</b></span> </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The Lunar Eclipse Moon in the</span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b> royal sign of Leo</b></span><span style="font-size: medium;">, a sign connected with the proud expression of the self. Leo energy is where we are kings and queens in our own castle. Is where we show ourselves self-love, is where we live from the heart. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Therefore, the Lunar Eclipse in Leo is about creating new </span><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>opportunities for growth for the queen inside you</b></span><span style="font-size: medium;">. Whether a woman or a man, we all have feminine attributes within our psyche. No matter who you are, it is time to be proud of the woman inside you, a woman who is not afraid to unleash her spirit, and live her calling.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">But a Lunar Eclipse is much more than a Full Moon, which makes it a little bit more complicated. When we have only Full Moons, we have the opportunity to choose. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Let&#8217;s take an example of a regular Full Moon in Leo. Let&#8217;s say there is Full Moon in Leo and you go to a social gathering. As people go up on stage and tell their personal stories, you feel inspired. You understand how it is to live from the heart and express yourself without fear. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">But when a Full Moon is also a Lunar Eclipse – like it is now &#8211; you have no choice but to go on stage yourself. Maybe you are shy, maybe you are scared to death of public speaking. Still, you have to go on stage, because an Eclipse will force you to become the energy you observe in others. It forces you act on the lessons you are learning. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">If you embrace the new, if you are ready to meet with your future &#8216;shadow&#8217;, with your North Node, then the experience can feel very rewarding. But if you don&#8217;t, the experience can feel rather traumatic. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps that&#8217;s why eclipses have been regarded – and still are – as bad omens. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In ancient times especially, the eclipses were seen as omens for disasters. The biggest possible disaster back then was the death of the king. In order to avoid this from happening, at solar eclipses (solar eclipses were connected to the king) a ritual was put in place: the &#8220;Substitute king ritual&#8221;. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Saving the king</b></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In this ritual<span style="font-size: medium;">, a person would be chosen to replace the king. He would be dressed like the king and placed on the throne. The person will live like a king for as long as the eclipse effects were supposed to last – from 3 days up to 100 days. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">During this time, the real king would keep a low profile and avoid being seen. After the eclipse season was over, the substitute king was put to death, to fulfill the prophetic omen, while saving the life of the real king, who would reclaim the throne. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It is much more to this ritual than simply trading fate. During the ritual, the real king delved into the shadows, just the the Sun disappeared under the shadow of the Moon. When he came back to the throne, he was no longer the same person. The king went through his own transformation process, and this was what the &#8211; symbolic &#8211; death of the king was about. He saved himself by letting a part of him die. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Right now we have a lunar eclipse, so now it&#8217;s time to create a ritual for the queen inside us. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">As the sky shuts down, it is time to move inward. A queen rules with her emotions. Are you rulling with your emotions or are your emotions rulling you? </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The Lunar Eclipse is opposite Venus, who is right now on the other side of the Sun, close to the South Node of the past. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The two feminine principles – represented by Moon and Venus – are now quarreling in the sky. </span></span></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><i><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Mirror mirror on the wall, who is the prettiest of them all?&#8221;</span></i></span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The Solar Eclipse on January 31<sup>st</sup> will ask us questions such as: </span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Who am I: my body or my emotions? My past or my future? </span></span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Should I go for what I want or wait to see how other details fit into the picture? </span></span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Should I put myself first or other people? </span></span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Should I go for instant gratification or build for the long haul? </span></span></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There are no right or wrong answers. But is the principle of duality, of opposition that helps us become more aware of who we truly are. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Just like the king had to find a substituted to find himself, use the energy of the Lunar Eclipse to get in touch with who you are – let go of who you are not and save the real Queen. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Now look into the mirror.</span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">answer&#8217;s right in front of your eyes.</span></span></span></p>

		<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">2018 features all slow moving planets in feminine signs, two total Lunar Eclipses, and the </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">relationship planets Venus and Mars retrograde. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In 2018 there are no major aspects between the outer planets, and no significant stressful aspects. Overall, 2018 is a much better year. You will be able to manifest what you have started in 2017 with less frictions and fewer obstacles. If you work hard, if you do some introspection and stop blaming the world for your problems, 2018 can be one of the best years of your life. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">If 2017 was like a hot air balloon, 2018 is time to get things done. No more Saturn square Neptune, no more fake news. No more Jupiter square Pluto, no more power struggles. No more Jupiter opposite Uranus, no more chaos and disruptions.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The year starts with all planets direct – January and February are the best time of the year to start new projects. In May your life will get disrupted as Uranus changes signs and moves into Taurus. June through to August are the most difficult months of the year – Mars retrograde and a difficult Lunar Eclipse in Aquarius will ask you to let go of something in your life. In October and November Venus also goes retrograde, bringing our focus onto relationships. The year ends on a positive note, with Jupiter entering its home sign, Sagittarius. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>In 2018 we will have five eclipses: </b></span></span></span></p>

<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Four out of five eclipses are in Leo / Aquarius, so pay extra attention to the houses in your natal chart where you have these signs. The message of the North Node in Leo and the South Node in Aquarius is to live more from your heart, and stop worrying about what other people think of you.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Leo / Aquarius energy already started to manifesting in 2017, but in 2018 it will be even stronger. </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I&#8217;ve seen many people quitting jobs that no longer fulfilled them, or completely changing their life direction, especially around the Solar Eclipse on 21<sup>st</sup> of August 2017. Now we are going to see even more of these changes. Remember, Leo is about taking the courage to be who you are meant to be. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">If in 2017 we had powerful Solar Eclipses, in 2018 we will have two powerful total <strong>Lunar Eclipses</strong>, so this year the Moon takes center stage. If the Solar principle is about designing the course of action, the Lunar principle is about taking action to make the vision concrete. We are now going to manifest what we have started in 2017. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The <strong>Lunar Eclipse on July 27<sup>th</sup> </strong>is problematic as it is a South Node Eclipse and it is also conjunct Mars retrograde. We have a double indication that around July we will need to let go of something important in our life. </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Check in which house you have Aquarius to get more insights into how you are going to be affected. </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the year our relationships come into focus because the 2 relationship planets Venus and Mars, go retrograde in June through to August and October to November. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We have a lot of Capricorn energy in 2018 – we have Saturn, Pluto, and Mars spending several months in Capricorn also, while the South Node will join the club in November 2018. You will definitely have to put a lot of work in this year &#8211; Capricorn is about working hard and accomplishing things. Whatever you do, do your best. Live with integrity and take full responsibility for your actions. Climb higher and get closer and closer to your objectives. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Another reason that you will get things done is that we have a lot of Earth energy in the sky </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;">– <span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">almost all slow moving planets are in Earth sings: Saturn, Pluto, Uranus. The Earth energy is fertile and manifesting and will turn even the abstract thinkers and philosophers into doers. Earth energy is not only practical, but also long lasting. Whatever you start this year, will bring you benefits in the long-run. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">These are the most important planetary events of 2018:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="western"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Chiron enters Aries </b></span></span></span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">on</span></span></span></strong><b> </b><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">April 17<sup>th</sup>, 2018 starting a new cycle around the Zodiac. Chiron in Aries will ask you to deal with the deepest wounds of all, the wound of identity. The transit will be long and cathartic and will teach you how to put yourself forward despite fears and shame.</span></span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="western"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Uranus enters Taurus </b></span></span></span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">on</span></span></span></strong> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">May 15<sup>th</sup>, 2018. Uranus is the planet of change and Taurus rules our personal values and our finances; we will experience many changes and shifts in these areas in the coming years. No more false, inauthentic values. Uranus in Taurus will set us free from imposed values and meanings. Time to rediscover our common sense. </span></span></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="western"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Mars is retrograde </b></span></span></span></strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">between</span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">June </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">26<sup>th</sup> &#8211; August 27<sup>th</sup>, 2018. Mars will draw attention on those areas of your life that you have been neglecting. Time to finally close some outstanding projects, to bring them to completion, but do not start completely new initiatives in this period. </span></span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Venus is retrograde </b></span><span style="color: #000000;">between October 5</span><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>th</sup></span><span style="color: #000000;"> &#8211; November 16</span><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>th</sup></span><span style="color: #000000;"> 2018. Venus goes retrograde every 18 months for 6 weeks. Because this retrograde takes place in Scorpio and Libra, the signs of intimacy and relating to others, this Venus retrograde is all about relationships. You can revise your relationships, or old lovers can come back into your life.</span></span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="western"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Jupiter trines Neptune</b></span></span></span></strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> on May 25<sup>th</sup></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> and on August 19<sup>th</sup></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">. This is the only significant transit between slow moving planets. Jupiter will bring us the faith to turn our most impossible hopes and dreams into reality. Neptune&#8217;s spirituality and creativity can now become more accessible, more authentic, more connected. </span></span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="western"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Jupiter enters Sagittarius</b></span></span></span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> on </span></span></span></strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">November 8<sup>th</sup></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> 2018. This is good news for everyone – even if Jupiter in Scorpio was a great transit thanks to the supportive alignments with the other planets, nothing compares to having Jupiter in its home sign. Zeus, the king of all gods, finally returns to Olympus, finally comes home. </span></span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>The North Node</b></span><span style="color: #000000;"> moves into Cancer on November 7</span><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>th</sup></span><span style="color: #000000;"> and South Node in Capricorn. The focus will shift from the masculine, abstract principle of the masculine Leo / Aquarius energy, to the material, nurturing and creative principle of the feminine Cancer / Capricorn energy. The transit will invite us to set healthy boundaries with the world, by releasing the need to always be in the control of our environment. </span></span></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;">These energy shifts will infuence all of us, but in different areas of our life. For example, if you are a Scorpio Ascendant, Uranus&#8217; entrance in Taurus can bring changes in the area of relationships, but if you are a Leo Ascendant, the changes will be in the area of your career. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;">Now that you know the overal ambiance of 2018, how does it fit with the goals you have set for yourself?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: medium;">Let&#8217;s do a simple, but powerful <b>exercise</b> to set you up for success in 2018 and beyond.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: medium;">1. Start with writing down your objectives for 2018</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: medium;">&#8230;&#8230;..</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: medium;">&#8230;&#8230;..</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: medium;">&#8230;&#8230;..</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: medium;">2. Now choose the most important one. Circle it.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: medium;">&#8230;&#8230;..</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: medium;">3. Now – pay attention to this – answer the following question: <b>What fear hides behind this goal? </b>Maybe the question sounds strange. You don&#8217;t have to stick to your first answer. Dig deeper. Why did you choose this goal? What are you really afraid of?</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: medium;">You will know you found the answer if it surprises you. If you still did not get to a satisfactory answer, keep asking the question: &#8220;What fear hides behind me choosing that goal for 2018?&#8221;. What do you feel when the answer comes to your mind, what images, what emotions?</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: medium;">To recap, 2018 is one of the best years in a long time. Things will come with less struggle and confusion than in previous years. You can now get a lot done – but you will have to put the work in and get yourself into the world. This is not a time for abstract thinking and theories, it is a time for action!</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: medium;">Your relationships may be up for review – time to ask yourself: &#8220;What is working? What is not working? How could this relationship look in the future? <b>What do I need to change?</b>&#8220;. This doesn&#8217;t mean you need to leave someone, it simply means that if you want to bring your relationships to the next level of intimacy and commitment, you need to have a close, truthful look at them first. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">If you want to see how the planetary transits are going to influence you more specifically, get </span></span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">yourself the <strong>2018 Astrology Forecast report for your Ascendant sign</strong>.

		<p class="western" align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On <strong>January 9<sup>th</sup> 2018</strong> we have an extraordinary planetary alignment: <strong>Sun, Venus and Pluto</strong> all align at 19° Capricorn in a triple conjunction.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Triple conjunctions are pretty rare. When we do have triple conjunctions we usually have the Moon (the fastest moving planet) involved. But to have 3 planets &#8211; other than the Moon &#8211; aligned at the same zodiacal degree is very unique.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Needless to say that if you have planets or angles around 19° Capricorn (and also in Aries, Cancer or Libra) you are especially in the spotlight.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">What is also very interesting is that Venus, one of the 3 planets involved, is now in the middle of her synodic cycle. Venus is in fact at the farthest possible distance from the Earth, on the other side of the Sun. When Venus is far away from the Earth we usually miss the earthy expression of Venusian gifts (love, attraction, relationships, money, personal values). On the other hand, on the other side of the Sun, Venus becomes more Goddess-like, more ethereal, more spiritualized.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="western" align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">If Venus close to the Earth is the meal we enjoy with our senses, Venus far away from the Earth is a beautiful painting displaying the same meal. If Venus close to the Earth is the love we consume, Venus far away from the Earth is the idealized, spiritualized, platonic love. Venus close to the Earth is similar to the Moon in nature, while Venus far away from the Earth is similar to Neptune in nature. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">When Venus is far away from the Earth as she is now, she expresses herself in an abstract way. And because she is in a conjunction with the Sun, our Self, our personality (the Sun), gets infused with this abstract expression of Venus. Now is a time to approach love and relationships as an ideal concept. Ask yourself: what does love mean to me? What does beauty mean to me? What are my personal values? You can set your ideals as high as the heavens &#8211; there has never been a better moment to dream of the highest expression of what you are capable of. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">To better understand the different expressions of Venus, have a look at your natal chart and see in which position is your Venus relative to the Sun.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Venus can be maximum 48° before the Sun, and maximum 48° after the Sun. Venus can only be in the two signs which precede, or follow your Sun sign. If your Sun sign is Virgo, your Venus can only be in one of the two signs before Virgo (Cancer, Leo), in Virgo, or in one of the two signs after Virgo (Libra, Scorpio). </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>If Venus was in direct motion, and within 10° before or after the Sun</strong> at the time of your birth, Venus was at the farthest possible distance from the Earth (just like now). You have a very idealized view of love and you can wait a lifetime for the price charming, even if you are in a happy marriage. There is a part of you who doesn&#8217;t belong to this world, who wants something that doesn&#8217;t exist. It is good to search for more spiritual type of partners who can understand you. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>If your Venus is within 10° of your Sun, but it is retrograde</strong>, the opposite is true. At the time of your birth, Venus was at the closest possible distance from Earth. You have a more Earthy expression of Venus, you are likely more down to earth, more practical, you go for what makes sense to you, and if you stop liking something, or someone, you just change it and go for the next best thing. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Now coming back to the triple conjunction we have on the 9<sup>th</sup> of January.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">What is really, really interesting is that <strong>we have Pluto as the third planet</strong> in the triple conjunction. And Pluto contracts are always interesting. If Sun reigns over the visible world, Pluto reigns over the underworld. Sun and Pluto together are the shaman, representing the Soul that has traveled to heaven, has traveled to hell, and has understood the cycles of life and death.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Pluto is a generational, archetypal planet. Pluto&#8217;s transit in a sign defines the drives of a whole generation. Baby Boomers for example have been associated with the transit of Pluto in Leo, while nowadays Millennials are associated with Pluto in Scorpio. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Although we are all unique, we do share some traits – and this common traits, this underlying drivers of our personality are the domain of Pluto. When Pluto touches a personal planet, he gets to the very essence of that planet, for good and for bad. People with <strong>Sun conjunct Pluto</strong> can be very ego-driven and can misuse their personal power (the lower manifestation of the Sun) or on the contrary, they can use their power for good and become extremely generous and compassionate leaders. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Same with Venus. <strong>Pluto with Venus</strong> can bring Venusian themes to the extremes, for good and for bad. Pluto with Venus can bring extreme jealousy, addiction to love and sex, obsession with money, or, in the higher manifestation can bring deep, passionate love, extreme beauty or artistic sense, the ability to create value and abundance. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Pluto will distill the characteristics of <strong>Sun and Venus in Capricorn.</strong> Pluto will get to the core of the matter. Capricorn is the most ambitious sign of the zodiac, always reaching for the next version of himself, always aiming for the top. Sun and Venus in Capricorn will want to get to the heights of love, beauty, appreciation. Sun and Venus in Capricorn are interested in nothing but the best – the most beautiful piece of art, the most successful relationship, the best status. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Sun conjunct Venus conjunct Pluto is the best time to ask yourself what do you really, really, really want to achieve. What is the best possible expression of yourself? What is that one thing that defines the ideal you, the YOU of tomorrow?</span></span></span></p>

		<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">2018 starts with a bang! More exactly with a Full Moon in Cancer which is also a Supermoon. January ends with a 2<sup>nd</sup> Full Moon in Leo, which this time is also a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://astrobutterfly.com/2018/01/23/full-moon-and-total-lunar-eclipse-in-leo-save-the-queen/">Lunar Eclipse</a></span>. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The first month of the year starts and ends with a Full Moon. Is not only that we have 2 Full Moons instead of one within one month, but what makes January so special is that both lunations are super potent – the first one takes place in its home sign Cancer, and the 2<sup>nd</sup> is a Lunar Eclipse. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">At the beginning of the year, when the Sun is at its lowest strength (at least here in the Northern Hemisphere), the Moon is more powerful than ever. The Moon is usually associated with the feminine principle &#8211; if you are a woman, in January things will come easier to you. The Moon is &#8211; together with Saturn &#8211; the most material planet. The Moon manifests whatever the Sun imagines and designs, the Moon<i> </i>is consciousness in action.<i> </i>So you will likely get a lot done in January!</span></span></p>

<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Apart from the Moon, we have another interesting event taking place in January: between <b>14</b><sup><b>th </b></sup><b>&#8211; 16</b><sup><b>th</b></sup><b> of January</b> we will have a record of <b>6 planets in Capricorn</b>. That&#8217;s a lot of Capricorn energy! It&#8217;s quite unusual to have more than 4 planets at a time in a given sign – it only happens when we also have slow moving planets in that particular sign. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The Sun, the Moon, Mercury and Venus will join Saturn and Pluto in the sign of the goat. Pay attention to what happens this month, what area of your life comes into focus, because it is likely that you will deal with this topic in the next 3 years of your life. All these planets gathered together in Capricorn will give you clues about the role Saturn in Capricorn is going to play in your chart. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Another important event in January is that starting with January 2<sup>nd</sup>, when Uranus goes direct we will have zero planets retrograde in the sky.<b> All planets will be in direct motion!</b> The universe is giving you a window of opportunity to act, to move forward, to achieve what you want to achieve without hurdles. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Do you know that feeling when Mercury is retrograde, and misunderstandings, delays, errors drain you of energy &#8211; and you need at least twice the amount of time and energy you usually need to get things done? Having all planets in direct motion is the opposite of that!</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">If you have many planets retrograde in your natal chart, this energy can feel a bit too strong for you. You may feel pressured to act without having all the details figured out. Go with the flow and trust that everything will work out in your favor in the end!</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">To sum up, in January we have a strong Moon, a strong Saturn, a stellium in Capricorn and all planets in direct motion. The Moon, Saturn, Capricorn, are all action oriented, practical, they manifest, they transform ideas and vision into tangible reality. January is the best time of the year to act and turn your vision into action. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><u>Let&#8217;s have a look at the major aspects of the month:</u></span></span></span></p>

<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On <b>January 1</b><sup><b>st</b></sup><b> </b>we have a Full Moon – which is also a Supermoon – in Cancer. The Moon is engaged into a Grand Water Trine with Mars is Scorpio and Neptune in Pisces and is opposite Venus. The Full Moon in Cancer will set the tone for the new year: 2018 will be the time to manifest what you have started to build in 2017. To do that, you need to reconcile the needs of your most intimate self, who wants to preserve what it has (Cancer) with the needs of your future self, who wants to grow and evolve (Capricorn). </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On <b>January 2</b><sup><b>nd</b></sup> Uranus goes direct. There are now literally ZERO retrograde planets in the sky. You have a green light from the universe to go for what you want. It&#8217;s not a coincidence that the last planet to go direct is Uranus – the planet of liberation. Now is the time to liberate yourself from any old patterns of thinking and go full steam ahead for Renewal. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On <b>January 6</b><sup><b>th</b></sup> Mars is conjunct Jupiter. Mars conjunct Jupiter is one of the best aspects we can have, especially given that Mars is at home in Scorpio. Now is time to go for what you really want, for your most impossible dreams and desires. You are especially favored if you have planets or angles around 17° Scorpio. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On <b>January 8</b><sup><b>th</b></sup><b> and 9</b><sup><b>th</b></sup> we have a triple conjunction between the Sun, Venus and Pluto. Venus is halfway in her cycle right now, highlighting the themes of the synodic cycle that started on March 25<sup>th</sup> 2017 and will end on October 25<sup>th</sup> 2018. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">This conjunction is one of the highlights of the year – triple conjunctions are pretty rare, and this one is especially important because it involves one luminary, the Sun, one personal planet, Venus, and one interpersonal planet, Pluto. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The personal realm will intersect with the interpersonal plan, and this is when important events take place. Something will definitely happen in your life if you have planets at 18-19° in Cardinal signs: Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On <b>January 11</b><sup><b>th</b></sup><b> </b>Mercury enters Capricorn and one day later on <b>January</b> <b>12</b><sup><b>th</b></sup><b> </b>Mercury conjoins Saturn. Mercury is finally out of the sign of its detriment and out of the retrograde shadow. Mercury is ambitious and determined in Capricorn and during this transit he will be even more so because the cycle starts with a conjunction to Saturn. Use your mental energy to get things done. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On <b>January 13</b><sup><b>th</b></sup> Venus squares Uranus and one day later on <b>January 14</b><sup><b>th</b></sup><b> </b>Sun squares Uranus as well. Something will have to go around these dates – Uranus will make sure you will get liberation from some old patterns of relating which do not longer serve you. Maybe you are too compromising, maybe in your desire to please others you sacrifice an important part of yourself. These squares to Uranus will show you what exactly needs to change. A few days later, at the time of the New Moon, you will have the chance to start anew. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On <b>January 16</b><sup><b>th</b></sup> we have New Moon at 26° Capricorn and a record of <b>6 planets in Capricorn</b>: Sun, Moon, Mercury,Venus, Saturn and Pluto. The New Moon will be the trademark of Saturn in Capricorn and will tell us know – without a doubt &#8211; what Saturn in Capricorn will be all about. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The New Moon takes place around the same degrees where we will experience the Saturn-Pluto-Jupiter alignment in two years from now, so pay extra attention to the messages that come to you around this date. The New Moon in Capricorn will shed light into what will keep you busy in the coming years. When you know what to expect you can get better prepared for the future. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On <b>January 17</b><sup><b>th</b></sup> Venus enters Aquarius and on <b>January 19</b><sup><b>th</b></sup> Sun also enters Aquarius, balancing the elemental energy in the sky. If the first two weeks of January have been infused with Cardinal and Earth energy, the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of January will be much more balanced, especially thanks to Venus and the Sun who move into Aquarius. Aquarius brings Air and Fixed energy, helping us get the clarity we need to focus on what is really important. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On <b>January 26</b><sup><b>th</b></sup><b> </b>Mars enters Sagittarius. Mars feels good in the fiery sign of Sagittarius – he is still as assertive and bold as in Aries and Leo, but in Sagittarius, Mars acts with the bigger picture in mind, and wants to align his personal will with the divine will. This is a good time to expand your horizons, to do strategy work, to mingle with people with a different outlook on life than yours, to travel to a far away destination. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">January ends on an even more intense tone than it started, with a <a href="https://astrobutterfly.com/2018/01/23/full-moon-and-total-lunar-eclipse-in-leo-save-the-queen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lunar Eclipse at 11°Leo</a> on <b>January 31</b><sup><b>st</b></sup>. Just like the first Full Moon of the month, this Full Moon and Lunar Eclipse is opposite Venus. Having two Full Moons in opposition to the planet of love is very interesting, especially given that both the Moon and Venus are the two celestial bodies symbolizing the two facets of the feminine principle. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Moon and Venus describe the two feminine archetypes: on one side we have the the Moon, the most primal aspect of our psyche, representing our emotions, our day-to-day behaviors, what we do in order to survive, our memory, our instinct to protect ourselves and protect the others. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On the other side, together with the Sun, we have Venus, the planet of relating, of giving and receiving, of what we like and dislike. In a nuthshell, the Moon describes the relationship we have with ourselves, so we can get our primal needs met, whereas Venus describes our relationship with the outside world, so we can get our social needs met. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The two feminine principles are now in opposition. While the Moon is very close to the Earth and therefore has an even stronger influence on us, Venus is at the farthest away point from the Earth right now, and is willing to sacrifice her needs in order to please the Sun. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Let&#8217;s see how the two feminine principles will reconcile. Have a look at which houses in your natal chart you have Leo and Aquarius to get more clues about which area of your life (represented by the Leo-Aquarius axis) needs reconciliation.</span></span></p>

<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><i>&#8220;Welcome to the Karma Cafe – there are no menus. You will get served what you deserve&#8221;</i></span></span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Imagine you are a customer of the Karma Cafe. You are anxiously waiting for your order – what will you get served?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Chances are, you already know what is in the menu for you. With Saturn, you always know where you stand. Saturn is the lord of karma – a reminder that what goes around, comes around.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Saturn is also the ruler of Capricorn. Capricorn rules the Midheaven, which is the highest possible expression of our natal chart, of our karma. Unlike the Ascendant, you are not your Midheaven. You BECOME your Midheaven. And this is the key of understanding Saturn – Saturn is the karma you can change, Saturn is your opportunity to make your life better.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Karma does not have to be fatalistic. Karma is a Sanskrit word that translates to &#8216;action&#8217; &#8211; it simply means every action you take has a reaction. It also means that you are in control of which action you choose to take.</span></span></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><i>&#8220;All barriers are on my side&#8221;</i></span></span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">A simple truth – but how many times are we tempted to blame others, our parents, our friends, our colleagues, our partner, the government, the society?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Saturn is a reminder that all the barriers are on our side – for the simple reason that it is little we can change about the world, but we can – always – change ourselves.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Karma denotes a cycle of cause and effect. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Sometimes you&#8217;re lucky, sometimes not. But at the end of the line, you reap what you sow. No one can escape this simple, but fundamental condition of life.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Did you always do your best at work, but your efforts never got noticed? Have you always been a loving partner but the others did not appreciate you? </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Just like a balance sheet, the assets match the liabilities. Saturn makes sure everything is fair, and balanced. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">If you do the work, Saturn will pay you dividends. Saturn in Capricorn will bring justice for all. If you did the work in the past (and of course you did, there is at least one area of your life where you gave more than you received) then Saturn will finally reward your efforts.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">What does that mean with Saturn&#8217;s entrance into Capricorn?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In Capricorn, Saturn returns HOME. He has been in a pilgrimage for the last 26 years, but now is finally the time to come back, to fulfill his promise, to show the word what he has learned, to teach others the art of patience and perseverance.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In Capricorn, Saturn is in his element – he operates at maximum efficiency and fulfills his promise. The bad? If you don&#8217;t do the work, Saturn will not be too nice to you. But if you do, then anything &#8211; literally anything &#8211; is possible.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Saturn and Capricorn are associated with traditions and hierarchies, but what Saturn in Capricorn really stands for is achieving the best possible version of himself. And yes, the world works in such a way, that most of the time, you have to follow the rules, you have to go with the regulations &#8211; if you want to become successful.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But Saturn in Capricorn is as cardinal as you can get. It&#8217;s not necesarily the structure that he likes (Capricorn is not a fixed sign afterall), but to get things done, to move forward. And if for this he needs to sign some papers and follow some directives, he will do it, because the goat has to climb to the top of the mountain, no matter what. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Saturn in Capricorn is like the American dream. Anyone can become successful, as long as they are willing to put the work.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">At the beginning of the transit (until it goes retrograde) Saturn comes with a reality check: he will show you the status quo of your life: if your life is great, great! If it is not, then Saturn will show you what must change, and what do you need to do to make it happen.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">When Saturn will turn retrograde, you will have the chance to adjust and revise. If you do so, and don&#8217;t resist change, by the time Saturn conjuncts Pluto in January 2020 the rewards will come. Rewards like nothing you had before.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Saturn will spend almost 3 years in Capricorn, from December 2017 until December 2020 &#8211; this is the perfect time to restructure you life, to make it better, to go to the next level of your existence.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">What is amazing about the Saturn transit in Capricorn is that it makes mainly positive aspects to the outer planets: a trine by sign to Uranus, a sextile to Pluto and a sextile to Neptune. Never in the recorded history did Saturn in Capricorn make so positive aspects. This is truly remarkable.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">How will you experience the influence of Saturn in Capricorn in the next 3 years? It depends which house in your natal chart will be transited by Saturn. You will most likely experience a shift already on December 21</span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><sup><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">st</span></span></sup></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> &#8211; a particular area of your life will suddenly become more prominent. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">What you can expect from Saturn in Capricorn according to your Ascendant sign:</span></span></span></strong></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Aries Ascendant &#8211; Saturn in your 10th house</strong>: you can completely restructure your life &#8211; your career, your relationships, your home and family. Later in the transit, you can find your true vocation and get the recognition you deserve. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Taurus Ascendant &#8211; Saturn in your 9th house</strong>: you can change some limiting beliefs, some things you believed in all your life will not be so relevant anymore. This is a good time to travel, study, or become yourself, a teacher. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Gemini Ascendant &#8211; Saturn in your 8th house</strong>: great time for deep, psychological transformation. You can become more interested in psychology, in occult, in spirituality. You might need to let go of some old identifications of the self, but by the end of the transit, deep healing is possible. Time to take charge of your intimacy and sexuality. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Cancer ascendant &#8211; Saturn in your 7th house</strong>: relationships will come into focus, you will feel compelled to have a mature, fulfilling relationship. You can either improve your existing relationship &#8211; if it is built on solid grounds &#8211; or terminate it, if it is not. All kind of partnerships – personal and business &#8211; will become more official, you can sign important papers or get married. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Leo ascendant &#8211; Saturn in your 6th house:</strong> your health and well-being will come into focus. <span lang="en-US"> You will have the opportunity to become more productive, efficient, and bring more structure to your daily life. Being of service to others will bring you fulfillment. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Virgo Ascendant &#8211; Saturn in your 5th house</strong>: you will learn to express your gifts and talents in a more constructive way – having fun will not only be about having fun, but also about sharing your creativity with others – you can become an artist, a freelancer, a performer, an entrepreneur. Relationships with children can improve. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Libra Ascendant &#8211; Saturn in your 4th house</strong>: your family, especially the women in your family, your home will come into focus. If you want children, this is a good time to become a parent. Cut ties with superficial people and focus only on who matters most. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Scorpio Ascendant &#8211; Saturn in your 3rd house</strong>: you can develop your skills, learn something new. This is also a great time to improve your communication skills – sometimes you are saying more when you are saying less. Join a Toastmasters club. Practice active listening. Your relationships with siblings can improve.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Sagittarius Ascendant &#8211; Saturn in your 2nd house</strong>: your financial situation can improve, but for this you need to become more disciplined with your budget. Pay off the debt, start saving, work on your money mindset. This is a good time to start your own business. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Capricorn Ascendant &#8211; Saturn in your 1st house</strong>: major reset in all areas of your life. You are no longer satisfied with half measures and you will be willing to become more responsible and mature to get to the next level of your life. Your health or career can come into focus.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Aquarius Ascendant &#8211; Saturn in your 12th house</strong>: you can finally complete a chapter of our life, put an ending to something that no longer serves your growth, get rid of self-sabotaging thoughts or behaviors. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Pisces Ascendant &#8211; Saturn in your 11th house:</strong> some of your long term goals can finally come true. But for this, you need to learn how to collaborate with others better. You can let go of some friendships which are not productive, and instead meet people with whom you share the same vision. </span></span></span></p>

		<p><strong>Countdown! Saturn moves into Capricorn on December 20<sup>th</sup>.</strong></p>
<p>Saturn in Capricorn is, without a doubt, the most important astrological transit of the year. Saturn changes signs only once every 2.5 to 3 years and marks a major shift in the area of your life ruled by Saturn.</p>
<p>Saturn is usually linked to frustrations, limitations and discipline. But the true essence of Saturn is so much more than that. Saturn <em>wants</em> you to become the best version of yourself, to achieve the greatest accomplishments you are capable of, and for this, he will help you get equipped with the adequate level of skills.</p>
<p>When you start something new, when you are at the beginning of the journey, you will of course experience some limitations and frustrations. This is Saturn’s way of showing what your ‘playing ground’ is.</p>
<p><strong>But Saturn’s limitations are a blessing in disguise.</strong></p>
<p>Do you know what are the biggest pains of life? What people regret on their deathbed? What that achy feeling is when you think that there is more to life?</p>
<p>The biggest pain in life is NOT fulfilling our mission, NOT becoming the best possible version of ourselves, NOT creating a legacy, NOT making a difference, NOT leaving behind something we can be proud of.</p>
<p>And this is where Saturn comes into play – to help you become the best version of yourself – thought maturity and introspection; to help you fulfil your mission and goals – through hard work and determination; to help you create a legacy – by learning the skills you need to create your masterpiece.</p>
<p>Each one of us has a mission. You have a mission. I have a mission. The life we are living is not only our chance, but also our duty to fulfill this mission.</p>
<p>In Astrology, our mission is represented by the Midheaven. The Midheaven, or Medium Coeli (MC), represents the highest point in the sky at the time when you were born.</p>
<p>The Midheaven is traditionally connected to Capricorn and Saturn. That’s why Saturn’s entrance in Capricorn will be all about reaching the highest possible state you are capable of.</p>
<p>Capricorn is the highest point of the Zodiac &#8211; pointing to who we aspire to be, to what we aspire to do. On the top of the mountain, everything is clear, and easy to see. The Midheaven is the point of maximum visibility in one’s chart – out there, everyone sees you, out there, you cannot hide.</p>
<p>In that point of maximum exposure, we want to show to the world the best possible version of ourselves.</p>
<p>On your way to the top, let Saturn be your guide. Let Saturn test you, push our limits, because only with proper training, you can climb the Everest.</p>
<p>With Saturn in Capricorn, it has never been a better time to embrace the next best version of yourself and to aactualize your purpose.</p>

<p>We humans are not made to stagnate. We are made to grow, to evolve, to move towards something.</p>
<p>Deep in our hearts, we all want to become the best possible version of ourselves. No matter how different we are from each other, we have one thing in common: the need for self-actualization, the need to become who we were meant to become.  In Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, the need for self-actualization is right at the top. There’s nothing else beyond it.</p>
<p>We are basically wired to reach the highest peak, to reach that Zenith, to reach the promise of our natal chart.</p>
<p><strong>How to get to the top of the mountain? </strong></p>
<p>Capricorn is here to help you too. Capricorn is a Cardinal Earth sign, bringing together the Cardinal qualities (taking action, self-motivation, ambition) with the Earth qualities (responsibility, reliability, structure). Capricorn is not only ambitious, be also has a plan on how to turn goals into realities.</p>
<p>With Saturn in Capricorn, just like the goat climbs up the mountain to get to the summit, you are now called to conquer your own personal mountain. Whatever your personal mountain is – getting the career you want, having a fulfilling relationship, being a role model for your children, sharing your knowledge with others, making the world a better place &#8211; in the next 3 years Saturn in Capricorn will give you the clarity, the patience, and the perseverance to get there. <em> </em></p>
<p>If you want to achieve something you don’t have, you need to become the person who is worthy of it. People who develop into the next version of themselves reach beyond their Ascendant. They move from the ‘status quo’, represented by the Ascendant, to the ‘self of tomorrow’, represented by the Midheaven.</p>
<p>From 20th of December 2017 on, it is time to discover what the view from the top is like. It’s time to finally get clarity about what you vision. And because Saturn likes to manifest the right vision, this is the time to finally get your goals met.</p>
<p>There is something in your life which requires your attention, something you know you need to address, something you have to dedicate your time and energy to. Something that if you will just get ‘right’ can catapult you to the next version of yourself.</p>
<p>It is impossible to get an unobstructed, 360° vision if you stay at the base of the mountain. You need to climb to the top. Without the right vision, it is literally impossible to get your goals met. Without a vision, there are no goals. And goals which are not connected to the right vision are never achieved.</p>
<p><strong>Ever wondered why New Year’s resolutions never come true? </strong></p>
<p>From my experience working with people, here are three main reasons why we don’t get our goals met:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Setting the wrong vision</strong>. The problem here is the lack of clarity. Chances are, if you had troubles meeting your goals in the past, it is because they were not the right goals in the first place, is because those goals were not built on a clear understanding of what your mission in this life is. There is a lot of literature on the law of attraction. The truth is, it’s not enough to want something badly in order to make it happen. Getting your vision right is THE most important thing if you want to get your goals met. Remember the mountain goat? You need to climb the mountain to get the clarity you need, to see what’s possible and what not.</li>
<li><strong>Having the wrong reasons</strong>. A world where everyone gets what they want, does not exist. Not all George’s Clooney’s fans will marry George Clooney. When your personal goal conflicts with someone’s else’s, chances are only one person, if any, will achieve it. Goals that are only about self-gratification rarely work. Your true goal, the reason you were born in this life, is much more than having your personal needs met. It’s about giving back, it is about leaving something behind, it is about creating something of value for the world.</li>
<li><strong>Not getting support</strong>. We are social animals. From the beginning of times, we lived in communities, we shared the same cave, we sat around the same fire. You cannot make it by yourself – you are biologically wired to share with others. Research study after research study has shown that sharing your goals with other people will make you much more likely to achieve them</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What is the formula for having your goals met?</strong></p>
<p>Get clarity on what’s possible, set goals which are not only inward, but also outward driven, and share your vision with like-minded individuals.</p>
<p>To help you achieve your goal, I have created the <strong>‘Vision board 2020 – Get your goals met with Saturn in Capricorn’. </strong></p>
<p><strong>‘Vision board 2020 – Get your goals met with Saturn in Capricorn’ </strong>is more than an astrology course – it is a platform to help you put all the pieces of the puzzle in the right places so that you can get a clear vision of what you need to do.</p>
<p>Just like a mountain goat, you need to have a top view. During the course, you will create a vision board with images, your unique 360° panorama from the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>Between December 21st and December 31st, you will create your vision board inspired by your personal goals and by the Saturn’s transit in Capricorn. The course will provide you with unique insights on how Saturn in Capricorn will influence you based on your ascendant sign, so that you can align your personal goals with the master plan of the Universe. You also have the opportunity to join a private Facebook group where you can share your vision and get support from like-minded individuals.</p>
<p><strong>There has never been a better time to set your vision.</strong></p>
