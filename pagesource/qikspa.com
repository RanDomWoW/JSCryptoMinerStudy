<p>Sensationalist but true fact coming up: eating more raw food will improve some aspects of your health.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">Cooking  food aids our digestive system and we absolutely need to ensure that we  kill off the dangerous bacteria that grows in raw meat, however we can  meet a happy medium with the type of vegetables we consume. BUT bear in  mind that vegetables lose most of their nutrition when they are cooked.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">The  most common form of raw vegetables served up as a standard dish is a  salad. You can get really creative which vegetables you combine in a  salad instead of opting for the usually expected ingredients such as;  lettuce, mixed leaves, tomatoes, cucumber, beetroot, celery and peppers.  Why not opt for something a little more creative that adds a great  amount extra to the nutritional value of the salad and add in some raw  spinach leaves, kale, carrots grated, courgettes thinly sliced,  mushrooms finely chopped and some blended broccoli.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">Sure  the above ingredients don't have to be used all at once, it's simply a  choice of adding something different in the nutritional spectrum and to  spice up a salad in a new way.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Juicing  has become a popular phenomenon in ensuring that a large number of  nutrients are being absorbed by the body each and every day. There are a  vast number of books and websites dedicated to the subject of juicing  and there is certainly a plan for everyone. If you fancy venturing down  the juicing avenue, preparing and drinking the juice in the morning is  the absolute optimum time. Your body has been repairing itself during  sleep and there's nothing better to start off a new day with a  nutritional juice for your vessel, which works so hard for you  unconditionally.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">If  you want to go the extra step and really say thank you to your body,  opt for a three or five day juice cleanse. It not only cleanses your  entire body but also cleanses your mind. If you have a dependence on  food which you know not to be good for you, then this is the perfect  positive way to stop lifetime bad habits and do something nice for  yourself.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">The  juice cleanses to go for are the ones that include vegetable juice as  well because you don't want to be running off just sugar from fruit for  five days. A balance between both will allow you to obtain more  nutrients and keep your blood sugar levels evened out as well. Also keep  some fibre from the fruit or veg in the juice!!</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph8">Always  get medical advice if you have any health problems and always look at  the reviews and ratings of juice cleanse you are thinking to use.  Nutritionists spend an extremely long time ensuring that their plans are  not only delicious, but totally stable, something you don't want the  cheap option on your health right.</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span><strong>Thai Massage: Yoga without Effort </strong></p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">Maybe the first image that comes to mind when someone mentions Thai Massage is a slim, Thai lady walking all over your back. However, there's much more to Thai massage than meets the eye.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">Developed in Thailand, Thai massage is a system of massage that has been influenced by the traditional medicine systems of India, China and Southeast Asia, as well as by yoga. For centuries, Thai massage was performed by monks as part of Thai medicine.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">More energizing and rigorous than more classic forms of massage, Thai massage is like doing yoga without any work for some people. In fact, this massage resembles yoga to the extent that therapists use their hands, knees, legs and feet to move you into a series of yoga-like stretches.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Thai massage might be known for being energizing, but it also has relaxing effects as muscle compression, joint mobilization and acupressure are also used during treatment.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">When you get a Thai massage, you usually line on a mat or firm mattress on the floor. You should wear something comfortable. Typically, it lasts 60 minutes to 2 hours. It includes rhythmic pressing and stretching of the entire body, which may include pulling fingers, toes, ears, cracking the knuckles, walking on the recipient's back and manipulating the receiver's body into many different positions.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">It can be done solo or in a group of 10 or so patients in the same large room. While the receiver may be positioned in a variety of yoga-like positions during the massage, the practitioner leans on the recipient's body using hands and usually straight forearms locked at the elbow to apply firm rhythmic pressure.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph8">Among its benefits, it relaxes you, reduces stress, improves circulation, increases energy, increases flexibility, improves range of motion, and centers the mind and bod<strong>y.</strong></div>
<div class="paragraph2">&nbsp;</div>
<p><strong>What is Swedish Massage?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swedish massage is the most common and best-known type of massage in the West. If it's your first time at the spa or you don't get massage often, Swedish massage is the best place to start.</p>
<p>If you want deeper work and can tolerate more pressure to get relief from chronic muscle pain, it's better to book a deep tissue massage, which is another form of Swedish massage.&nbsp; If you have pain, it will likely take a series of massages to get results.<br />
Swedish massage and other types of therapeutic massage are performed by trained, licensed massage therapists. A Swedish massage can be slow and gentle, or vigorous and bracing, depending on the therapist's personal style and what he or she is trying to achieve.</p>
<p>During a Swedish massage you are generally nude underneath a towel or sheet. The therapist uncovers only the part of the body he/she is working on, a technique called draping. If that gets you out of your comfort zone, you can keep your underwear on, and many newcomers do.</p>
<p>You usually start by lying face down with your head in a u-shaped face cradle so your spine stays neutral. The therapist generally starts by works your back, using various massage strokes that include effleurage, kneading, friction, stretching and tapping.</p>
<p>When he's finished with the back, he or she works the back of each leg. When done with the back side, he or she holds the sheet or towel up and looks away while you turn over onto your back and scoot down; then he or she quickly covers you again.<br />
The therapist then massages the front of each leg, both arms, and generally finishes with your neck and shoulders.</p>
<p>Some therapists work in a different order, and all have their own style and techniques. If you only have 50 minutes, you can also ask them to spend more time on a certain area. If the pressure is too light or too firm, you should speak up and ask the therapist to adjust it. Swedish massage usually includes some deeper work on areas of specific muscle tension, but if you truly want deepter, more intensive work and firmer pressure, book a deep tissue massage.The cost of a Swedish massage will vary, depending on whether you go to a day spa, resort spa, destination spa.</p>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span><strong>The Hidden Reasons You're Getting Headaches &amp; How to Manage Pain </strong></p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">When it comes to pain, I have experienced it all and most important, I have learned how to manage it. A broken foot, wrist, dislocated knee, and I have even suffered from partial paralysis with surgeries on my knee, shoulder and cervical spinal fusion. These are just some examples of somatic (musculoskeletal) and neuropathic (nerve) pains.  Of I've experienced visceral (internal organ) pains as well; stomach cramps, menstrual pain, anxiety, and so on. But, what do you do when you are in pain?  Do you put a Band-Aid on it or find the cause of your symptoms?</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">If you take a pill to get rid of your headache, for example, you are masking your symptoms. However, if you lie down in a dark room, close your eyes, take deep breaths, and allow yourself to experience the pain, then you are finding the cause of the headache. First, let's answer a few basic questions so you can understand why you got the headache in the first place:</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4"><strong>Fatigue</strong>: How many hours of sleep do you get per night? Do you sleep through the night?</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5"><strong>Food Allergies/Unhealthy Diet</strong>: What does your diet consist of?  High/Low sugar and carbs?  Do you consume processed foods?</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6"><strong>Alcohol Consumption/Smoking/Exposure to Smoke</strong>: Do you drink alcohol? Do you smoke?</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7"><strong>Dehydration</strong>: How many glasses of water do you drink per day?</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8"><strong>Menstrual Cycle</strong>: Are you ovulating? Menstruating?</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9"><strong>Muscle Tension or Strain</strong>: Do you exercise? What kind of exercise?</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10"><strong>Stress</strong>: What is your stress level?</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph11">The next time you have a headache, don't just take a pill.  Sit down and pay attention to your body and become aware of your signs and symptoms.  There are always reasons behind visceral pain; it is up to us to listen to our bodies and take care of it.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph12">Somatic and neuropathic pains have obvious causes, soft tissue and nervous system injuries respectfully.  How do we manage these pains?</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">Ever feel like your self-esteem is on an emotional roller coaster? Sometimes you feel good about yourself. Sometimes you don't. There are times when you're resilient and times when you'd like to curl up in a corner and disappear.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3"><strong>What's going on? </strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">Taking a look at self-esteem can offer a clue. Self-esteem is the ability to feel good about yourself, appreciate your work, take pride in who you are, your abilities, and accomplishments&hellip; and at the same time know that you're not perfect.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5"><strong>Step out of the past&hellip; </strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">Self-esteem is shaped by input from others. From earliest days, people around you have been sending messages &ndash; both verbal and nonverbal &ndash; about how you're doing. Parents, teachers, family members, peers, playmates &ndash; their words and judgments can linger on. In fact, messages from childhood can affect how you're talking to yourself right now!</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7"><strong>And into the present&hellip; </strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8">Although the roots of self-esteem are in childhood, the only place to begin the work that supports change is right here, right now. Achieving a clear and balanced view of yourself and accepting your value as a unique person &ndash; not a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; person &ndash; can boost self-esteem and help you feel happier and more confident. That's where mindfulness comes in. Simply being present in the moment in a gentle, non-judgmental way can help you cultivate self-acceptance. If you listen mindfully you can start to hear an interior commentary that may surprise you. Sometimes it's supportive, sometimes harsh. When you see and understand what you're telling yourself &ndash; and when &ndash; you can begin to make changes to support self-esteem.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9"><strong>Here are some mindful tips to help you get started: </strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10"><strong>Stop the Blame Game! </strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph11">When you're in a slump, you can be interpreting actions, events, and interactions in a way that builds negative momentum. Be mindful and challenge your thinking! Are you caught in an all-or-nothing pattern of thinking? &ldquo;I didn't do this perfectly&hellip; I screwed it up. Never get anything right&hellip;&rdquo; Are you mistaking feelings for facts? &ldquo;I feel like a failure&hellip; I am a failure&hellip;&rdquo; How about mental filtering? &ldquo;That's no big deal, anyone could have done it.&rdquo; Jumping to negative conclusions? Someone hasn't called you back &ndash; could it be that she's just busy? No need to create a low self-esteem story!</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph12"><strong>Start practicing positives </strong></div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph13">As you explore your self-esteem self talk, take some full gentle breaths in and out&hellip; and&hellip; begin to claim your successes! Acknowledge what's worked, learn from your mistakes, and be kind to yourself. Understand that patience is important. Building self-esteem is a process that happens one moment at a time&hellip; an opportunity where you can change your life &ndash; and only you can do it!</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span><strong>Brush Shape </strong></p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">Brush shape will determine where the mascara hits your lash. To achieve volume and thickness, most brushes need to be fuller, thicker and have more bristles. Curling mascaras tend to have a curved wand to help lift the lash. For lengthening mascara, most brands will provide a wand that is straight and narrow that looks more like a comb than the traditional brush. The more space there is between the bristles, the better the brush will be at separating and defining your eyelashes.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3"><strong>Lengthening Mascara </strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">If you love extra long lashes that hit the sides of your sunglasses, you will want to find mascara with a lengthening formula. Lengthening mascaras tend to have ingredients like fibers that can attach themselves to your own lash for a longer look. They tend to have a formulation that you can layer up without clumping and they work well for someone with shorter lashes.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5"><strong>Thickening Mascara </strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">Thickening mascara will add volume and weight to the lash. They tend to be a more dense formula and may contain silicone polymers or wax that makes your lashes look fuller. With a thickening mascara you want to apply liberally, but wipe the brush with a tissue to remove excess mascara between coats. Focus a thickening mascara at the area of the lash you want to accentuate. Apply it to the center of the eye for a more open eye and at the corner for more lift or for cat eye looks.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7"><strong>Curling Mascara </strong></div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph8">Curling mascara traditionally contains polymers and resins to help your lash hold the curl temporarily. With a curling mascara you want to get the most amount of product at the root to allow it to take shape.</div>

<p><strong>Selecting the right facial for your skin</strong></p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph">Life  in cities like London, New York, Paris, Rome, Singapore can be tough on  women and men. Everything from the seasonal haze, polluting traffic and  scorching Sun can get in the way of your health. Taking care of your  skin &amp; your face is imperative to bring out your natural best.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2"><strong>Oily Skin</strong>:  Oil produced by your body can help keep your skin healthy but too much  is too bad. You'll need a deep cleansing facial that increases the flow  of oxygen to your skin. Applying masks &amp; clays to your face can draw  out oils &amp; cleanse pores to redeem your radiant glow.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3"><strong>Tired Skin</strong>:  Putting in long hours at work can dull your skin. Exfoliation is a  great way to brighten up those dead cells. Facial packs that have  coconut milk, saffron, banana &amp; honey can revive your complexion  &amp; bring a natural richness to it.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4"><strong>Dry Skin</strong>:  Having dry skin can dehydrate your body &amp; its advisable to avoid  soap-free products. Using moisturizers that are rich in ceramides &amp;  glycerin can help draw water to your skin. Banana masks, &amp; avacado  masks can do magic for you.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5"><strong>Sensitive Skin</strong>:  Women with sensitive skin should avoid product-heavy facials. Opting  for a calming mask that will stimulate blood flow &amp; sooth your skin  will your best bet. Beauticians usually remove blackheads before they  start a facial which can cause redness &amp; lesions. Advise them to do  it with great care.</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span><strong>What is massage &ndash; It can be defined as an act </strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>To give a massage to (someone or a part of someone's body)</li>
    <li>To rub or press (someone's body) in a way that helps muscles to relax or reduces pain in muscles and joints</li>
</ol>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3"><strong>A brief history about massage </strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">Massage has developed continuously in China for nearly 5000 years. Western ideas are considered within the traditional framework. It is widely practiced &amp; taught in hospital &amp; medical schools &amp; is an essential part of health maintenance &amp; primary healthcare.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5"><strong>Hot Stone Massage?</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph">During a hot stone massage the therapist heats as many as 50 basalt stones of varying sizes to 120&ndash;140&ordm; F, rubs them over your oiled body, &amp; rests them on top of &amp; beneath you on your stomach, in your palms, on your back. The stones' warmth enhances the relaxing effects of the pressure. Some people believe the stones have healing, grounding qualities, which makes hot stone massage a more profound experience than your basic massage. The therapist will leave some of the smooth, heated massage stones in contact with your body &amp; use others to massage you. Cold stones are sometimes incorporated, especially on the face, where they have a firming effect. Hot stone is a feel-good treatment found on most spa menus. Hot &amp; cold stone temperatures have said to be like the &lsquo;vascular gymnastics' of the circulatory systems, the system that controls self-healing in the body.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph"><strong>What is Deep Tissue Massage?</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph">Deep tissue massage is a type of massage therapy that focuses on realigning deeper layers of muscles and connective tissue. It is especially helpful for chronic aches and pains and contracted areas such as stiff neck and upper back, low back pain, leg muscle tightness and sore shoulders.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph">Some of the same strokes are used as classic massage therapy, but the movement is slower and the pressure is deeper and concentrated on areas of tension and pain in order to reach the sub-layer of muscles and the fascia (the connective tissue surrounding muscles).<strong><br />
<br />
Benefits of Deep Tissue Massage<br />
</strong>Deep tissue massage usually focuses on a specific problem, such as chronic muscle pain, injury rehabilitation, and the following conditions:</div>
<ul style='list-style-type:square;margin-left: 24px; margin-right: 0px;'>
    <li>Chronic pain</li>
    <li>Lower back pain</li>
    <li>Limited mobility</li>
    <li>Recovery from injuries (e.g. whiplash, falls, sports injury)</li>
    <li>Repetitive strain injury, such as carpal tunnel syndrome</li>
    <li>Postural problems</li>
    <li>Muscle tension in the hamstrings, glutes, IT band, legs, quadriceps, rhomboids, upper back</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Does Deep Tissue Massage Hurt?</strong></p>
<p>At certain points during the massage, most people find there is usually some discomfort and pain.<br />
It is important to tell the massage therapist when things hurt and if any soreness or pain you experience is outside your comfort range.</p>
<p>There is usually some stiffness or pain after a deep tissue massage, but it should subside within a day or so. The massage therapist may recommend applying ice to the area after the massage.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph1"><strong>What is Sports Massage?</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph">Sports  massage was developed to help athletes prepare their bodies for optimal  performance, recover after a big event, or function well during  training. Sports massage emphasizes prevention and healing of injuries  to the muscles and tendons.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">But  you don't have to be and athlete to benefit from sports massage. Sports  massage is also good for people with injuries, chronic pain or  restricted range of motion. The massage therapist generally concentrates  on a specific problem area that you present, usually associated with  some sort of sports activity, such as running, tennis, or golf.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">The  most important thing with sports massage is that you find a specially  trained massage therapist who has mastery of a wide range of techniques  and knows when to use them.  Many spas used to put sports massage on  their menu as a way to appeal to men.  As spas have become more  sophisticated, however, they realize they shouldn't list sports massage  unless they have some therapists with specialized training.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4"><strong>What Happens During Sports Massage? </strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Sports massage therapists will use a variety of techniques to achieve the desired goal.</div>
<ul style='list-style-type:square;margin-left: 24px; margin-right: 0px;'>
    <li>Pre-event sports massage -- a short, stimulating massage 15 - 45  minutes before the event. It is directed toward the parts of the body  that will be involved in the exertion.</li>
    <li>Post-event sports massage -- given within an hour or two of the event, to normalize the body's tissues.</li>
    <li>Restorative sports massage -- given during training to allow the athlete to train harder and with less injury.</li>
    <li>Rehabilitative sports massage -- aimed at alleviating pain due to injury and returning the body to health.</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph"><strong>Types of massage you can book </strong></div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>In modern times, stress and hard work can rule your life. That is why you deserve to treat yourself with a break before your wedding. While a short getaway to Bali can be quite tempting and de-stressing, a short trip to the Spa can save you time and money. Indeed, the Spa has countless benefits for the mind and the body that will not only enhance your health but will also improve your appearance.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2"><strong>Here are some benefits of a Spa: </strong></div>
<ol>
    <li>De-stress: dating back 3,000 years, massage is one of the oldest healing arts. Undeniably, a therapeutic massage will definitely relax and soothe you. Wash away your worries in a stream shower or a hot tub, and even sweat the stress out in a sauna.</li>
    <li>Improve your health: your massage therapist will detect which parts of your body are too tense. That way the therapist can teach you how to relax your muscles and also give you tips on how to relax, plus suggestions for a nutritious diet and a healthy lifestyle.</li>
    <li>Benefits for the mind: A trip to the spa will not only relax you, but it will also stimulate you mentally and physically. You might even find yourself more confident and with a higher self-esteem. While a foot scrub can invigorate you, a massage therapy can work wonders on depression. As well, facials, manicures and pedicures also have its psychological benefits.</li>
    <li>Weight loss: you can find different approaches to weight loss depending on the spa you go to. Therefore, you can choose which weight-loss program is more beneficial for you.</li>
    <li>Detoxification: is a process that purges toxins and excess fluids in the body. Some spas offer juice fasting and colon cleansing, which will help you eliminate bloating and water retention. Once you've purified your body, you will feel like new.</li>
    <li>Feel and look young: pampering your body and mind can help deter aging. It is scientifically proven that stress makes you get older at a faster pace. Since a therapeutic massage can help you relax and a relaxed body translates to less stress, your body will retain that youthful essence. At the same time, facials and other skin care services and body treatments can foster a young look and make you feel renewed inside.</li>
    <li>Improve blood circulation and manage blood pressure: spa treatments such as hydrotherapy, massage, heat therapy and other body treatments can stimulate blood circulation and regulate blood pressure. In one study by Mayo Clinic researcher Thomas G. Allison, where he found that soaking in warm water helped lower blood pressure.</li>
    <li>Improve flexibility and breathing: in some Spas, you can practice Yoga and Pilates which work on your flexibility and breathing.</li>
    <li>Regulate sleeping patterns: if your body and mind are free from tension and stress, you should be able to sleep like a baby.</li>
    <li>Body aches and pains: massages, hydrotherapy and heat therapy can help reduce pain. Some medical spas even offer therapeutic programs to address arthritis and nerve disorders such as fibromyalgia.</li>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>More women are becoming interested in prenatal massage to help make a pregnancy easier. It's important to know the benefits and risks of prenatal massage.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">Prenatal massage is designed to relieve the discomfort and stress of pregnancy while making special adjustments to normal massage practice because of the changes pregnancy makes in the body. Prenatal massage therapists are specially trained not only in the techniques of prenatal massage, but also to recognize signs of prenatal disorders, such as preeclampsia, that can endanger the mother or child.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">In general, prenatal massage has far more benefits then risks, but it is still worth considering both benefits and risks before scheduling an appointment.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4"><strong>What is Prenatal Massage Like </strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">In the early stages of pregnancy, prenatal massage is very like a regular Swedish massage, except that the massage therapist will avoid sensitive areas of the body, as well as acupressure points that are known to trigger labor, and will check for excessive swelling or other danger signs.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">In later stages of pregnancy, the massage is given with the mother-to-be lying on her side, with bolsters, pillows and cushions supporting the legs and belly for comfort. Some tables, specially designed for prenatal massage, will have a whole cut in the center of the table so the mother-to-be can lie comfortably on her stomach.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7"><strong>Benefits of Prenatal Massage </strong></div>
<ul style='list-style-type:square;margin-left: 24px; margin-right: 0px;'>
    <li>Reduces stress levels</li>
    <li>Eases back and foot pain caused by changes in posture</li>
    <li>Reduces swelling of feet and ankles</li>
    <li>Improves skin elasticity, reducing stretch marks</li>
    <li>Improves sleep</li>
    <li>Improves digestion</li>
    <li>Relaxes and soothes baby</li>
    <li>Reduces pelvic pain</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">Additionally, a prenatal massage therapist can frequently recognize early signs of dangerous complications, reducing the risk to both mother and child.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10"><strong>Risks of Prenatal Massage </strong></div>
<ul style='list-style-type:square;margin-left: 24px; margin-right: 0px;'>
    <li>Dizziness and nausea</li>
    <li>Untrained therapist causing injury</li>
    <li>Too deep massage of back or abdomen causing spotting or cramping</li>
    <li>Inducing labor</li>
    <li>Muscle soreness</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph12">For the most part all of these side effects can be avoided, as long as the therapist knows what he or she is doing. Nausea and dizziness can occur after any massage, and are not uncommon during pregnancy. Avoid eating immediately before a massage, and get up carefully to avoid problems. Muscle soreness is generally the result of not getting enough fluid after a massage. Drink a lot of water in the first two hours after a massage to prevent this.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph13"><strong>When to Get Prenatal Massage </strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph14">A mother-to-be can get prenatal massage at any point during a healthy pregnancy. In a high risk pregnancy, or when there are medical complications it's a good idea to talk to both your obstetrician and a prenatal massage therapist. Be aware that some doctors who are not familiar with massage may say it is or is not all right to get a massage, without knowing what the real risk factors are.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph15">Prenatal massage can be a wonderful way for a mother-to-be to pamper herself, and ease the discomforts of pregnancy. The risks and side effects of prenatal massage can be avoided with a bit of care. However, in a high risk pregnancy, it's a good idea to consult an ob-gyn before getting a massage.</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>Shiatsu is a type of massage therapy that was primarily developed in Japan. With its name derived from the Japanese term for "finger pressure," it involves applying pressure to specific points on the body. While shiatsu has roots in traditional Chinese medicine</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2"><strong>Uses for Shiatsu </strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">Shiatsu is often used to relieve stress and protect against stress-related health issues.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">In addition, shiatsu is said to aid in the treatment of the following health problems: anxiety, arthritis, asthma, back pain, bronchitis, colds, constipation, coughs, depression, headache, insomnia, menstrual problems, migraine, neck and shoulder pain, premenstrual syndrome, sciatica, and sinus problems.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Shiatsu is also said to increase energy, promote recovery from injuries, and stimulate the digestive system.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6"><strong>What Does Shiatsu Feel Like? </strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">When performing shiatsu, massage therapists use their fingers, thumbs, and/or palms in a continuous rhythmic sequence. The finger pads are used to apply pressure throughout the treatment, and each point is typically held for two to eight seconds.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph8">In some cases, the pressure points stimulated during shiatsu may feel tender. Those receiving shiatsu often describe this tenderness as "good pain," but it's important to alert your therapist if you feel discomfort or pain during your massage. Your therapist can then adjust the pressure to make the massage more comfortable for you.</div>
<div class="paragraph2">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="paragraph2"><strong>Healing power</strong></div>
<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span></p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph1">Based  on traditional 3500-year-old oriental medical wisdom developed in  Japan, Shiatsu is a holistic healing art that incorporates the  principles of anatomy, physiology and pathology. This alternative  medicine consists of finger pressure, stretches and other massage  techniques.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">According  to Chinese traditional medicine, energy &ndash; known as chi or qi &ndash; moves  through the body in well-defined channels or pathways known as  meridians. Each meridian line is connected to an internal organ and  carries the energy of that organ's optimum functioning. Shitsu  practitioners believe energy flow through Meridian Lines has an  important influence on the health of the individual.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">Like  most natural therapies, shiatsu believes that the body is a  self-healing organism. Therefore, therapists believe that the manual  manipulation of that vital energy called qi can help to unblock the body  and thus help the body heal itself.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">Imbalance  in the energy system, which means too little or too much chi, can cause  many sicknesses depending on which meridians are affected.  In this  scenario, the practitioner treats the receiver to restore balance in the  energy system.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">By  addressing physical and psychological functions with this dynamic body  therapy, the practitioner is able to address and balance the underlying  causes of a condition.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">Even  though the word shiatsu translates from Japanese as &ldquo;finger pressure&rdquo;,  in reality, the thumbs, palms, elbows, knees and feet are used to apply  pressure to various parts of the body. Depending on the condition being  treated, the pressure can be gentle or firm.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph7">Some of the benefits of this  treatment include stimulating circulation and the flow of lymphatic  fluid, it also works on the autonomic nervous system, helps to release  toxins and deep-seated tension form the muscles and can also stimulate  the hormonal system. Likewise, shiatsu allows the receiver to deeply  relax, stimulating the body's inherent ability for self-healing and  regeneration.</div>

<p><span class="blogcontent" id="blogcontent"> </span>Reflexology is a form of bodywork that focuses primarily on the feet.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">The underlying theory behind reflexology is that there are "reflex" areas on the feet and hands that correspond to specific organs, glands, and other parts of the body.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3"><strong>For example: </strong></div>
<ul style='list-style-type:square;margin-left: 24px; margin-right: 0px;'>
    <li>The tips of the toes reflect the head</li>
    <li>The heart and chest are around the ball of the foot</li>
    <li>The liver, pancreas and kidney are in the arch of the foot</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7"><strong>How is it different from foot massage? </strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8">Foot massage is similar to Swedish massage, the most common type of massage in North America.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">People typically use massage oil or lotion and use gentle gliding strokes all over the foot. Reflexology is quite different. While many people find reflexology relaxing, it's based on the theory that certain points on the feet correspond to certain organs and body parts and that applying pressure to the areas can promote health in the corresponding parts.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10"><strong>Why do people get reflexology? </strong></div>
<ul style='list-style-type:square;margin-left: 24px; margin-right: 0px;'>
    <li>Stress and stress-related conditions</li>
    <li>Tension headaches</li>
    <li>Digestive disorders</li>
    <li>Arthritis</li>
    <li>Insomnia</li>
    <li>Hormonal imbalances</li>
    <li>Sports injuries</li>
    <li>Menstrual disorders, such as premenstrual syndrome (PMS)</li>
    <li>Digestive problems, such as constipation</li>
    <li>Back pain</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph12">Reflexology is a popular alternative therapy. It promotes relaxation, improves circulation, reduces pain, soothes tired feet, and encourages overall healing. Reflexology is also used for post-operative or palliative care. A study in the American Cancer Society journal found that one-third of cancer patients used reflexology as a complementary therapy. Reflexology is recommended as a complementary therapy and should not replace medical treatment.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph13"><strong>What is a typical reflexology treatment like? </strong></div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph14">A typical treatment is 45 minutes to 60 minutes long and begins with a consultation about your health and lifestyle. You are then asked to remove your shoes and socks and sit comfortably in a reclining chair or on a massage table. Otherwise you remain fully clothed. The reflexologist will assess the feet and then stimulates various points to identify areas of tenderness or tension. The reflexologist then uses brisk movements to warm the feet up. Then pressure is applied from the toes to the heel according to your comfort.</div>
