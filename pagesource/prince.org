You are probably going to see many more mistakes since many of those in charge are not asking us for input and are making decisions while attempting to learn Prince 101. - Sharon Nelson&rdquo;</span>&mdash;<a href="/profile/June7" target="_upf" >June7</a>, 8/17 in the <a href="/msg/7/446102#msg_10007767">forums</a></p>
<p class="uq"><span class="uqtxt">&ldquo;<p>Honest question: if Prince's father was the original composer of elements of the Purple Rain melody or even if his work was a subtle inspiration to it, why is that necessarily a bad thing? Sharon definitely left that answer open/vague - and I'm not sure if that was totally on purpose OR if mystique/speaking in riddles is a family trait. IMO - her making it a point to say that PR was one of her faves because "she heard the melody first" from their dad more than likely speaks to there being some kind of fond family memory associated with the melody and later the song. But that's just me...</p><br /><p> </p><br /><br /><p>With that said,  I understand everyone's desire to preserve Prince's legacy, but thatt doesn't take ANYTHING away from Prince at all. And frankly, with Prince's varied interests in many styles of music and growing up with a father who seemed to frequently be composing music, I would be VERY surprised if there never was any overlap between music he heard growing up and the music he later created. James Brown, for example, is ALL OVER some of Prince's funk output, so why wouldn't John Nelson be?</p>&rdquo;</span>&mdash;<a href="/profile/PurpleMusic07" target="_upf" >PurpleMusic07</a>, 8/17 in the <a href="/msg/7/445871#msg_10005380">forums</a></p>
