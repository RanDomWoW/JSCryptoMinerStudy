It fitted in with my schedule.”&#10;&#10;“I was surrounded by people who were super passionate about learning. The material I engaged with was thought provoking. It really stretched us, it stretched me.”&#10;&#10;“I wasn’t sure what the online learning experience would be like.”&#10;&#10;“I was surprised. I was pleasantly surprised.”&#10;&#10;“So I think if I look at the material, for me it was all of the things in combination to one another. It’s very thoughtfully planned out. It’s broken up with videos that keep you engaged, quizzes that popped in every now and then just testing your knowledge and helping you reflect back. So there’s all this combination of really thoughtfully put through elements, and that for me was really engaging.”&#10;&#10;“Coaches were there all the time. They were accessible. I found this new family online.”&#10;&#10;“The course coach makes you feel like you’re one in a million, and they’re always there for you to keep your learning on track. It felt like they had tethered themselves to my ultimate learning outcome.”&#10;&#10;“I was able to learn new things throughout the week and almost trial them in the workplace.”&#10;&#10;“I felt supported throughout the entire course. I could manage my own time, when I want to sit down, when I want to study.”&#10;&#10;“The discussion forums on the online campus makes you feel like you’re not alone. You engage with the subject matter with your fellow students and the tutors. That really helps you learn because you have to articulate your thoughts on the issue in your own words. And you help to learn from each other in that way.”&#10;&#10;After the course, I had the confidence to start my business, and I’ve never looked back.&#10;&#10;You can never stop learning because the world advances.&#10;&#10;“I think it’s important to have an always learning mindset it allows you to build yourself to the point where you want to be.”&#10;&#10;“It doesn’t matter how old you are, and it doesn’t matter where you are in your life or your in career. It’s never too late to learn, and it’s never too late to go after what you want.”</textarea></div></li></ul></div><button aria-label="Close" class="close-button" data-close="" type="button"><span aria-hidden="true"> &times;</span></button></div></section><section class="featured-courses sectioned_content block_margins"><div class="row base1_bottom_padding"><h2>Featured short courses</h2><p class="base3_bottom_padding">To be the best, you need to learn from the best.
